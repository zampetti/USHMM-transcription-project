Walter Meyer, M-e-y-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s20">And I -- We’re going to start with the post-war, or really, I know the story, a very touching story about the Red Cross taking you home, and I wanted to ask -- my first question is, when do you identify the end of the war, or liberation period, as some call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Well, when the Americans occupied the city of Düsseldorf --</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: I should ask, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I was in the basement of my house, because the city -- the Americans were across the Rhine, not only was the city bombarded by the air, but also by artillery, so we were in the basement of the apartment building in which we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: When you say we?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: That is my parents and I, plus the other tenants.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Your mother had gotten tenants for -- in the same house, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well, it was an apartment house of six apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s29">And going back just a little bit, when the Red Cross took you to your mother -- to your home, is that right?</span> <span id="s30">Do you remember any particular impact that the Red Cross had on your rescue?</span> <span id="s31">A lot of people have memories about the Red Cross and their work.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, it was not actually the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s33">The Red Cross wanted to take me to a hospital and I insisted, I said, “No, I am dying, I want to go home.”</span> <span id="s34">So I -- An old taxi cab, converted into somewhat of an ambulance took me home and I told the driver, “Go and ask for my father.</span> <span id="s35">Don’t shock my mother, because I haven’t seen her for some time.”</span> <span id="s36">And -- So, later on, I heard he went up, asked for my father, wasn’t there, then he told my mother that he had something for her, and my mother thought that it was a suitcase that my father had sent from France.</span> <span id="s37">And he had finally said, “Look, why don’t you go with me?”</span> <span id="s38">So I -- my mother walked down.</span> <span id="s39">It was snowing, and she looked into the car and she was a little confused because she didn’t recognize me.</span> <span id="s40">And so then I told her, “Mother,” and finally, after she looked three times, says, “Walter?”</span> <span id="s41">And that is when she called a neighbor to have to carry me in, and I remember the neighbor touched my legs and they were inflamed and extremely painful.</span> <span id="s42">So, eventually, they got me in and someone in the train had given me an apple, that caused me to have a little diarrhea, so I asked them to take me to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s43">And shortly thereafter, the bell rang, it was my father and my mother yelled, “Paul, Walter is here.”</span> <span id="s44">So he came and he saw me and then he just couldn’t control himself and cried for a long time.</span> <span id="s45">Then they sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Why do you think he was crying?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Because of my condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: He also did not expect to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No.</span> <span id="s50">Maybe three days later, two policemen came looking for me, and my father said, “Yes, he is here.”</span> <span id="s51">And he brought them in and he uncovered me, said, “Do you want to take him like that?”</span> <span id="s52">And I think I weighed about 78 pounds.</span> <span id="s53">And one of them knew me because I was a star swimmer, and they told my father, “Nevermind, we’re going to say that -- that he was not here.”</span> <span id="s54">So they left and then we accommodate -- accommodate ourself in the basement.</span> <span id="s55">Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe three days later, my father, upon my mother’s suggestion, tried to find a doctor who assured my parents that there was no hope.</span> <span id="s56">So a priest was called, who gave me the last sacraments, and -- but obviously I didn’t die.</span> <span id="s57">And then when the Americans marched in, I think it was April the 12th, my father went to see the commanding officer, told him about me and they came with the military ambulance, and took me to a German hospital which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company, and I was with them, ooh, for quite some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: How far from Düsseldorf, from your parents, were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Oh, three blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Oh, that’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yeah, the hospital was kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: So the hospital was taken over then, by Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And did you say that there was a Jewish man in charge, a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes, Major Hermann.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: And one of the questions that I wanted to ask you is -- is a long time sort of prospective from the post-war to the present time is, from here, from this doctor, have you experienced prejudice because you are a German in certain circumstances, and if so, where?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Oh well, once with Major Hermann.</span> <span id="s68">We didn’t -- It didn’t mean enough to him that I had suffered and that I was not, in quote, a Nazi.</span> <span id="s69">I was a German and that was enough for him, he being Jewish.</span> <span id="s70">After that -- No, I think -- Well, of course, when I traveled in France, at that time it was near impossible to tell somebody, I am German, they would have liquidated you.</span> <span id="s71">So I traveled through France as a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s72">I have participated in conversations like, these Goddamn Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s73">So, except -- until when I came to South America, which is about as pro-German as you can get, in any part of South America, and quite anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s74">So as a German, no, except for the -- the -- the time immediately after the war in other European countries, where I didn’t dare say that I was German, other than that no, I had -- there were no repercussions because of my heritage, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: I want to go back to your being in the hospital and three blocks away and how long you were in the hospital and did you see your parents?</span> <span id="s76">A: Yeah, my parents came from time to time and I remember that I gained, oh sometimes as much as a pound and a half a day.</span> <span id="s77">And one day the American doctor told me that my heart would not support so much gain of weight and that I had to get up and I thought that was a bad joke.</span> <span id="s78">But I remember h-he telling me that I had to jump on one leg 13 times and then on the other one, where little by little, I went -- some GIs drove me around in a wheelchair and I would do sketches of the GIs.</span> <span id="s79">And then, maybe it was two or three months later, I walked with this cane and I was released and I was then with my parents.</span> <span id="s80">And Americans, shortly thereafter, were replaced by the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: In the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No, not in the hospital, as occupation troop.</span> <span id="s83">The -- The -- si -- The American military zone -- part of the American military zone became British.</span> <span id="s84">They -- They re-divided geographic areas, where the Americans stayed in Frankfurt, Heidelberg and so on and the British used another part of Germany and of course the Russians took all of East Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: You had quite a -- a rich life since, which is why I wanted to start here, and I also had a question, although I understand that you were a person who loved adventure, I wondered how long you stayed at home, and why did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Situation in Germany was rather unbearable, Black Market, one German would denounce another German for being a member of the Nazi party, for having done this or that.</span> <span id="s87">The entire country was destroyed, Düsseldorf 75 percent.</span> <span id="s88">There didn’t seem to be a future.</span> <span id="s89">Money did not exist, it was bartering.</span> <span id="s90">Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main items for bartering.</span> <span id="s91">My parents had lost my brother, who had fallen to his death in the Alps.</span> <span id="s92">My mother continuously cried.</span> <span id="s93">So it was a period of depression and even though at that time it was an impossibility to leave, you couldn’t leave -- you couldn’t go in the street after 10 o’clock.</span> <span id="s94">But somehow I flirted with the idea of going to America.</span> <span id="s95">And anybody with whom I would have shared the idea would have declared me insane.</span> <span id="s96">I went to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who -- I understand that he had an estate, or his family had an estate in America.</span> <span id="s97">And I didn’t know that much about the difference of South America and North America, to me America was America.</span> <span id="s98">I went to see him, and I remember he asked me, “Where do you want to go, eventually?”</span> <span id="s99">“Well,” I said, “America.”</span> <span id="s100">“What part of America?”</span> <span id="s101">And I said North America just to give him an answer.</span> <span id="s102">He said, “Well, I’m very sorry, but my family has an estate in -- close to Buenos Aires, in Argentina.”</span> <span id="s103">Then I went to see my father, and I told him that -- that I was going to try to leave.</span> <span id="s104">Said, “You know that’s impossible.”</span> <span id="s105">Well, I said, “I’m going to try.”</span> <span id="s106">And he said that, “If I didn’t know you, I would say you are crazy, but -- but there’s no need for me to say anything.</span> <span id="s107">All I say that whatever person you meet, just expect them to be no good and if they are good, you’re going to have a very pleasant surprise.”</span> <span id="s108">That was his advice.</span> <span id="s109">I had previously tried -- well, let me explain that many Germans in large cities, knowing that the cities were to be or were being bombed, took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in rural areas, which happened to be the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s110">My parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends.</span> <span id="s111">And going to the Russian zone was quite an adventure and I went to the Russian zone several times.</span> <span id="s112">And that itself is quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Was this the Russian zone in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Russian zone in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: And that meant that the Russians were in charge of everything [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: They were the occupying force, and they were terrible.</span> <span id="s117">So, we’re -- going to the Russian zone was in itself something like going to a foreign country.</span> <span id="s118">I had gone there twice, so I figured that somehow I sh -- I should be able to go.</span> <span id="s119">I had an address of a relative of a friend in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: What was your motive for going?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Oh, I was sick and tired of Germany, of the situation in Germany, thought there must be better places in the world then, than corruption, Black Market, degeneration, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So you said goodbye to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well, I didn’t say, excuse me, I didn’t say goodbye, I told my mother that I was going to a water polo championship, and she said, “There’s nothing like that.”</span> <span id="s124">“Yeah,” I said, “yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s125">I’ll be back next week.”</span> <span id="s126">I came to see her again seven years later.</span> <span id="s127">So she didn’t know that I was gone.</span> <span id="s128">She thought I was going to be away for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did you tell that to her to protect her, if anyone asked, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Oh, yeah, I -- I -- no, I told that to her because she would not have allowed me to leave, and I didn’t want her to cry.</span> <span id="s131">So I stow away to Achen, which is right on the border, and there I -- I had some cigarettes with me that I gave to a railroad employee, and I asked him -- I spoke to him with a French accent and I told him that I had been in Germany as a French prisoner of war and that I’d fallen in love with a German girl and I’d come to see her and I needed to go back.</span> <span id="s132">And I wondered whether he could help me, whether there was a train going across.</span> <span id="s133">He told me about a cargo train and well, I hid in that cargo train and went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s134">I went to see an old farmer.</span> <span id="s135">Matter of fact, I visited the farmer’s son last year.</span> <span id="s136">And he told me, “Don’t come up, they’re looking for Germans all over the place, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: How did he know you?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: He didn’t know me.</span> <span id="s139">I told him who I was.</span> <span id="s140">He was the cousin or nephew of a lady in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s141">You have to underst --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Oh, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: -- You have to understand the situation.</span> <span id="s144">The border towns in Germany and Belgium, they were German during the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s145">After the Kaiser, they -- they became Belgium.</span> <span id="s146">Hitler took it back, and after Hitler lost, they returned to Belgium.</span> <span id="s147">So those areas, like Alsace-Lorraine, they all speak German and they’re probably more German than Belgian, or Germ -- [indecipherable] so anyway, he gave me some sandwich, an apple, and told me that I should wait for the milk truck.</span> <span id="s148">It took me to Liège.</span> <span id="s149">Well, at -- at noon time, I was in -- in Brussels and I stayed a few days in Brussels, visiting with a friend of my father.</span> <span id="s150">Then I went to France and eventually I became a sailor.</span> <span id="s151">That went on until December of ’48, when I stow awayed on a -- on a Dutch freighter and went to South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Before we get to South America, I -- I was interested that you learned English from American GIs.</span> <span id="s153">Could you --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, I didn’t learn from them, let’s say that I progressed, cause I had had English in school, and I was -- I’d always been a linguist, so languages are not of any difficulty to me, and so, with the GIs, I had a very good opportunity to practice and to learn more vocabulary and maybe become a little more Americanized in -- in my speech pattern.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And this is while you were in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: True, true.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: So, how did you get to South America now?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, I stow awayed on a Dutch freighter and went first to Brazil.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: How -- Do you remember the name of the freighter, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Par-Parkhaven.</span> <span id="s163">Pay -- P-a-r-k-h-a-v-e-n.</span> <span id="s164">One of the oldest ships on the ocean at the time, was still a coal ship, and then a -- there weren’t too many coal ships around any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Coal, c-o-a-l?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And from what port did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: From Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: How do you stow away?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Well, at the time, in different ports of Europe, I went aboard ships, and -- well, the first time I went on a ship was I worked in a nightclub in Bordeaux drawing portraits and a captain walked in and he was -- he was quite drunk already, but I did his picture anyway and he paid me and he drank more, and eventually he was unable to -- to walk, and I felt sorry.</span> <span id="s171">And in port cities, there’s always danger of being attacked.</span> <span id="s172">So, I took him under my arm and took him to his ship, which was the Silver Ocean, a Swedish ship, and oh, it must have been three in the morning, and when I woke up, we were on the ocean.</span> <span id="s173">He looked at me and said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s174">And I told him, he said, “Well, if you helped me to come aboard the ship, I ought to help you.”</span> <span id="s175">And he gave me a seaman’s book, which is kind of an ID card for sailors, and with a seaman’s book, you can actually work on almost any ship that needs help, but I lost the seaman’s book eventually.</span> <span id="s176">Anyway, with him I went to Casablanca.</span> <span id="s177">I went back to continental Europe and I was trying to stow away on an Argentine ship, but the captain kind of smelled --</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: What part of eur -- you mean you went directly back on that same ship to return to --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No, I went -- went back on another ship and went to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s180">From Toulouse I think he went to La Rochelle.</span> <span id="s181">La Rochelle to Lavre, and I went eventually -- went to Rotterdam, Amsterdam and eventually I came back to Anverb and I received at the post office, letter from my father, who said that, “Dear Walter, there -- you will not be able to leave Europe for America.</span> <span id="s182">Your mother has baked special cookies for Christmas and I ask you to come home and be with us for Christmas.”</span> <span id="s183">And I wrote back, “If I don’t get a ship until next week, I’ll be home.”</span> <span id="s184">And that’s what I would have done, but on December the 16th, I was on the Parkhaven and stow awayed on the Parkhaven.</span> <span id="s185">I had someone who helped me.</span> <span id="s186">The way it goes when you stow away from a European port, you try to stay hidden for at least two days, until you’re far away from the British Isle, because if not, speed boats will pick you up and bring you back.</span> <span id="s187">Captains hate stowaways aboard.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Could I ask you, before we get too far on this ship, did your father know that you were leaving, whereas your mother did not?</span> <span id="s189">He knew where to write you.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s191">Oh, by that time -- by that time, of course after one week, I didn’t return and I sent letters home, s-so oh yes, my mother knew I was gone.</span> <span id="s192">She still hoped that I would be back soon.</span> <span id="s193">And so, on this ship, I think the second day, the chief steward came and discovered me.</span> <span id="s194">The beds generally have curtains so the light doesn’t bother you so much and he drew the curtains and he saw me there.</span> <span id="s195">And they convinced him not to report me to the captain.</span> <span id="s196">By they, I mean the few guys who knew about me.</span> <span id="s197">And so he said, “Well, can’t leave him here, you have to find another hiding place.”</span> <span id="s198">So they put me to the most horrible place of all places, and that is where the propeller of the ship is.</span> <span id="s199">Well there is a -- there’s a small ladder going down if you have to repair the propeller, and there’s some old, big ropes lying there.</span> <span id="s200">And I was there, well, I guess a day and a night.</span> <span id="s201">And boy, you could always feel the water comes almost to your feet and then goes back down and it’s solid black.</span> <span id="s202">I mean, a -- a -- a dungeon is nothing in comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you have food?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yeah, they -- they -- they dropped some food down, or they let it down with a rope, so I ate a little bit.</span> <span id="s205">Well, anyway, after that time never passed, they finally got me out and -- and then took me to the captain and the captain, remember asked me about my nationality and I told him I was French.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: You had no passport or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No, I have no passport and -- and he -- oh, I told him that I was -- spoke Dutch and he asked me to pronounce Slavaninga, which is a city in Holland and no Frenchman can pronounce Slavaninga, it’s just impossible.</span> <span id="s208">So I says Slavaninga, he says, “You’re not French.”</span> <span id="s209">And so I told him that actually I was from Alsace-Lorraine and I also spoke German, and he kind of accepted that and he told me what to do and I became a coal trimmer.</span> <span id="s210">A coal trimmer is one that shovels coal and shoves it to the firemen, who in turn put the coal into the fire.</span> <span id="s211">So I worked together with a -- with a black guy from Curaςao, his name was Lovey.</span> <span id="s212">And I had a shift from four to eight in the morning and four to eight in the evening.</span> <span id="s213">I began to do drawings, copies of photographs and I became rather popular on the ship and the captain called me one day and told me that we were going to first go to Vitória in Brazil and that he asked me to be quiet, that he would not turn me over to the authorities.</span> <span id="s214">I had told him that I had an uncle in Utawai who was waiting for me, and that came because I had met some guys on an Argentine ship.</span> <span id="s215">One of them had told me that his family lived in Montevideo, that I was welcome.</span> <span id="s216">Then he gave me an address in Montevideo.</span> <span id="s217">The other one gave me an address in Buenos Aires where I could stay.</span> <span id="s218">So anyway, I told the captain that I had an uncle in -- in Montevideo and he said, “I’ll bri -- take you Montevideo, so just don’t move in Brazil and let the immigration and the police come aboard and I’ll take care of you.”</span> <span id="s219">And so Lovey, my companion, asked me, “What did he want?”</span> <span id="s220">“Well,” I say, “he told me that he wouldn’t turn me over to the authorities.”</span> <span id="s221">He said, “You can’t trust the captain, there’s no way he will protect you.</span> <span id="s222">He’s going to turn you over to the authorities and you’ll be shipped back.”</span> <span id="s223">Well, I didn’t want to take a chance, so we came to Victoria -- Vitória --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: In what country?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Brazil.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: And, see, the foreign ship never comes into the port, it’s always a pilot that guides it in.</span> <span id="s228">So the pilot came, I said, “This is it.”</span> <span id="s229">So I jumped and swam ashore.</span> <span id="s230">But a police boat picked me up.</span> <span id="s231">They took me police station -- I was not allowed to swim there and then they didn’t ca -- quite know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s232">An interpreter came, and he happened to speak English so-so and German quite well.</span> <span id="s233">I think his grandfather was German.</span> <span id="s234">And I convinced him not to turn me over to the immigration offices in Rio.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: This is the end of side one.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: -- interview with Walter Meyer, tape one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: So I convinced this German speaking interpreter to let me go and I stow awayed on the same -- same ship, for the second time.</span> <span id="s239">The captain was extremely furious when he saw me.</span> <span id="s240">He -- He -- I -- He could hardly believe that I had not trusted him and I convinced him that there was too much at risk, that I didn’t want to go back and well, he finally understood and said, “Well, I promise you I’d take you to Uruguay,” and so he did.</span> <span id="s241">And I went to see the family of the man who told me that I could stay with his family and I was told very clearly that there was no way for me to stay there, that the man was on th -- on the sea, that he would not be back for another month and that I should go to Argentina, would be easier than Uruguay.</span> <span id="s242">So I went back to the captain, I told him that I talked to my uncle, who had moved to Buenos Aires, and, “Please Captain, take me there with you.”</span> <span id="s243">And he said, “No, police in Argentina is little -- too bad, I don’t want any problem.</span> <span id="s244">But if you stay here, sooner or later we’ll come back to Uruguay and we’ll take you back with us then.”</span> <span id="s245">“Well, thank you very much.”</span> <span id="s246">I think he gave me 10 Uruguayan pesos at the time and told me that I would always be welcome.</span> <span id="s247">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Welcome on his ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: On his ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So he liked your work and your -- personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Oh yeah, he li -- he liked me well.</span> <span id="s252">Three o’clock in the morning, I went to visit the -- you have two branches on a ship, the -- the officers and the engineers.</span> <span id="s253">The engineers, the chief engineer, first engineer, second engineer, depending upon the size of the ship, they have a third and the assistant engineer, that’s one who went to school and is doing his internship.</span> <span id="s254">Well, that was Chris.</span> <span id="s255">Told Chris, “I have to go with you.”</span> <span id="s256">And he said, “I’m going to lose my license, I can’t help you.”</span> <span id="s257">Well I said, “Nobody will know.”</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: What license?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: His license as an engineer.</span> <span id="s260">So, at three o’clock in the morning I came aboard.</span> <span id="s261">People were asleep.</span> <span id="s262">I left a little -- I had a little suitcase, small, little suitcase with clothes that I left with him, and I had nothing on but shorts and he took me under the -- under the fireplaces.</span> <span id="s263">There are all kinds of pipes.</span> <span id="s264">He took me underneath there and he said, “Be quiet here, nobody will find you.”</span> <span id="s265">Well, I was there until the next day, and I heard by the noise, the -- the ship was moving.</span> <span id="s266">It was going across the river Plate to Buenos Aires, which is eight hours -- 12 hours, something like that.</span> <span id="s267">And the size of my room was about like being in a coffin.</span> <span id="s268">What I didn’t know is that the crew, the firemen, knowing that they would be in Buenos Aires for about a week, and they didn’t need any power, because the pilot would pull them in, they began to clean the fireplace, and all the warm ashes fell on me.</span> <span id="s269">A-And I was beginning to realize that I was losing my conscience and I just couldn’t stay, so I crawled through the door and I came out.</span> <span id="s270">And I had a big layer on -- of ash on me.</span> <span id="s271">They told me later that they thought I was a black guy.</span> <span id="s272">They rinsed me with the water hose and then they recognized me.</span> <span id="s273">“What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s274">Well -- And they called the chief engineer, the captain was asleep and the chief engineer said, “I’ll have to tell the captain.</span> <span id="s275">I’m very sorry, I can’t assume this kind of liability and you will be handed over to the authorities.”</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Authorities where?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: In Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s278">So, I decided to go for a swim again, and I swam about -- oh probably about four or five miles to the port of Buenos Aires, until I heard some policeman screaming.</span> <span id="s279">I assume they said you -- you’re not allowed to swim here and I said, well, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s280">I got out and jumped on a Norwegian ship.</span> <span id="s281">I remember they asked me, “Where you coming from?”</span> <span id="s282">And I pointed way, way out there, “I came swimming from that ship,” and they kind of celebrated me like a hero and gave me some special soap, I was oily, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: What language did you communicate in?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: English.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: English.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: And I was a little scared because they had told me there was sharks, and so -- and the River Plate is filthy because all the ships throw all the debris in the water, so when I was swimming, I hit a piece of a board, of wood, or something like that, and I was always scared it was a big fish.</span> <span id="s287">Anyway, I waited for my ship to come and after the authority had come aboard, everything was cleared.</span> <span id="s288">Then, I went to visit, and the captain saw me and said, “How in the world did you get here?”</span> <span id="s289">And I laughed and I said, “Swimming.”</span> <span id="s290">So then he said, “Let me tell you again, any time you want to come with us, you’ll always be welcome.”</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What did he admire about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Well, that I had done the impossible, swam from his ship.</span> <span id="s293">I mean, it was an unusual thing to do.</span> <span id="s294">So then I went to see -- I went with Chris and I had the other address of this Argentine officer, Asketta was his last name, that I could stay with his grandmother.</span> <span id="s295">So we found the address, which wasn’t too far away from the port, but I was told no way I could stay there.</span> <span id="s296">And Chris had to go back to the ship, and it was January, it was the 24th of January, 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: And Chris is?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Chris is the assistant engineer.</span> <span id="s299">And I ended up close to Plusa Italia, a big, big square with a large, large park.</span> <span id="s300">And that’s -- that became my house for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s301">So I became a homeless and I remember oh, the fourth day, I saw these horse carriages driving around the square very slowly and I was curious.</span> <span id="s302">You always find somebody who speaks either German or French or English or whatever, and I learned something rather interesting.</span> <span id="s303">They were walking around -- slowly around the square, because those were driving hor-horses -- horse carriages.</span> <span id="s304">Anyway, there was a -- th-the famous circuit -- the racing circuit of Buenos Aires was close by and I heard the noise in the morning where the race cars came.</span> <span id="s305">There were gar -- guys putting these big blocks in the curve -- straw blocks.</span> <span id="s306">And some guys were building little kiosks where they sold sodas and so on.</span> <span id="s307">And I made friends with one and helped him, so I had free sodas and maybe a sandwich.</span> <span id="s308">And I took some of the blocks and built myself a little house, to have some protection.</span> <span id="s309">It was hot, and summer in Buenos Aires is very humid, very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s310">Well that’s -- And I stopped people on the street and asked them if they had maybe a pesos to spare, that I wanted to eat something.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: What I’m wondering is, were there a lot of people after the war, who were just traveling around, like you, lost?</span> <span id="s312">Or -- What were you seeking?</span> <span id="s313">Did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Maybe there is something innate in me and that is seeking adventure.</span> <span id="s315">But -- Th -- Y -- I owe you an answer to your question, and that is, traveling was extremely difficult because, well, as a German of course, Germany did not exist, hence there was no passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: W-W-Why did it not exist?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, because is was occupied by -- by different -- as a country it didn’t exist, it did not have a government.</span> <span id="s318">The British were there, th-th-th -- so there was a military government, but there was no passport of any sort, so you couldn’t go anywhere, it was totally out of the question.</span> <span id="s319">And others, of course, other -- other Europeans, well, why would they travel?</span> <span id="s320">This was not the time, like today that the Dutch go as tourists to Tunisia and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: I was more referring to a lot of Jewish people who were in Displaced Persons camps and families who were separated and -- did you run into any of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, that was -- that was immediately after the war, you had refugee camps.</span> <span id="s323">In Germany there was one cl -- and I know quite a few Jewish fellows in -- close to Frankfurt in a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s324">Most of them were, I think, Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s325">And they were trying to be -- they were displaced, so were -- they were -- they were trying to be organized and sent back, but there was no traveling per se, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: So you didn’t find a lot of comrades, friends to travel with?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: You were very solitary.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Oh, very much so, yeah, yeah, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: So, where are we now?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Well, we are in Buenos Aires, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: You said that South America was very friendly to German.</span> <span id="s333">Could you all of a sudden start speaking German, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah, I was not -- As a matter of fact, I would find eventually, people who would say things like, “You know Walter, the only mistake that Hitler made, he didn’t kill all of them.”</span> <span id="s335">That’s what you would hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: In South America?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: In South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Why do you think South America felt that way about Jews and why do you think that they were so friendly to Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Because the Germans, first of all, there are large German colonies in South America, in Argentina, in Chile and Peru.</span> <span id="s340">Chile, mostly.</span> <span id="s341">And the Germans are very desirable immigrants.</span> <span id="s342">They’re not trashy.</span> <span id="s343">They become teachers, they become professionals.</span> <span id="s344">They integrate, marry natives, contrary to the British.</span> <span id="s345">So they’re very much desired and in demand and some of them become outstanding citizens, some of them enter politics, some of them become statesmen.</span> <span id="s346">So, as a whole, German immigration, even in Texas here, I mean, people go out of their way to say, “Oh, my grand-grandfather was German.”</span> <span id="s347">It doesn’t make a damn bit of difference to me, but they show you that -- they will not go out of their way to say that their great-grandfather was Polish, but if he was German, they will let you know.</span> <span id="s348">And of course, there’s many, many German towns here, Brownsville, Fredericksburg, Neiderveld, all kinds of German festivities and so on.</span> <span id="s349">So, anyway, going back to South America, then products made in Germany meant quality.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Did you meet any Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No, the only one that I didn’t meet, but I -- that I saw once, somebody took me to have a beer at a place where Germans would go.</span> <span id="s352">There was General Galland, the very famous young German Air Force general who had shot down, I don’t know, 200 British planes, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: It’s G - a -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: G-a-l-l-a-n-d.</span> <span id="s355">And he had been imported by the Argentine government to work as a -- I assume as a consultant or something like that, in the Argentine Air Force.</span> <span id="s356">I saw him kind of from far away.</span> <span id="s357">But no, I had never -- I had never -- no, I’d never met any [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Because many were in hiding there in South America when --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes, I understand that, but no, I never met anybody and later on I heard that some had been in Argentina and they were down in the Pategonia, and -- but no, I never met anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s362">So we are in Buenos Aires now and I stop people on the street, asking them to help me with a pesos or two.</span> <span id="s363">And, then I go to restaurants and draw sketches and I meet one who helps me get a job in a -- in a place that makes posters for the subway, so I do a little painting there and they say, “Well, we can’t employ you for too long, because you don’t have documents.”</span> <span id="s364">And one day I -- a friend of mine said, “Why don’t you drive out to Martinez, which is a suburb where the film studios are and they always need temporary workers.</span> <span id="s365">Maybe you get a job there.”</span> <span id="s366">And I went there, and without going into too many details, I met an American movie star by the name of John Carroll, who is long dead.</span> <span id="s367">He had come down to do a picture with Adele Marra and with -- with the Argentine actor who became famous later.</span> <span id="s368">I used to room with him and that was Fernando Lamas.</span> <span id="s369">And so John Carroll somehow liked me, and I went from living one day under a tree and the other day on an old mattress, I went to one of the most beautiful estates in Buenos Aires, which he had leased, and became his assistant.</span> <span id="s370">Went to Buenos Aires to exchange money, helped to organize a party.</span> <span id="s371">I did whatever.</span> <span id="s372">Of course, that lasted only while he was there, and then he said, “I want you to come to America, to be with me.”</span> <span id="s373">And he took me to the German -- to the American consulate.</span> <span id="s374">And I remember I was a little surprised that the consulate’s name was Gerra, which was a very -- which is a very Spanish name.</span> <span id="s375">And I was told, “Well, you’re German, and that means we have to put you on the waiting list and the way it stands right now, it’ll take about six years.”</span> <span id="s376">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: They knew you were German then?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s379">At that time, I didn’t have to hide any more.</span> <span id="s380">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s381">Oh, maybe my next job was singing in a -- in a nightclub.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So you just gave up your opportunity?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Well, John went back to the States, and I had made some connections.</span> <span id="s384">Another thing, John went to this nightclub with me once, called Zanzibar and they had a couple of German waiters, and they were rather nice, I went to visit.</span> <span id="s385">And one day, there wasn’t much traffic, and I took the microphone and sang a little, “Night and Day.”</span> <span id="s386">They said, “Why don’t you sing?</span> <span id="s387">We need somebody.”</span> <span id="s388">So I made a little money and I think I knew three songs and sailors would come in, ask, “Why don’t you sing this, why don’t you sing this?”</span> <span id="s389">All I knew was three songs and I was always happy when the hour was over.</span> <span id="s390">So that’s how I started.</span> <span id="s391">One day I met -- a customer came and I did a sketch of him, and he said, “Do you like the country?”</span> <span id="s392">“Yeah.”</span> <span id="s393">“Well, why don’t you come up north, to Salta?”</span> <span id="s394">Well, that’s like coming from New York to Texas, something like that.</span> <span id="s395">So I took the train, went there and went to Salta, northern Argentina, close to the Bolivian border.</span> <span id="s396">Worked for him and eventually I came to have a small tobacco plantation.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: My own.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: How did you afford it?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, h -- I worked for him.</span> <span id="s401">People take a long siesta and I said well, if I work a little for him during siesta time and I have a little time in the evening and work for myself, and he had about 20 acres, or maybe 30 acres.</span> <span id="s402">Said, “Could I have that land for me, to plant some tobacco for myself?”</span> <span id="s403">And he said yes.</span> <span id="s404">So, I slept maybe six hours, I felt that was enough then.</span> <span id="s405">But that -- I had -- I was going to be somewhat of a millionaire that year, because the tobacco was beautiful and Peron had decreed that nothing any more could be imported, ev-everything had to be made in Argentina.</span> <span id="s406">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Peron being the president?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s409">So, no more tobacco from outside, so the national product went up in price and I was going to make a hell of a lot of money, but the day of harvest, the locusts came and destroyed everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: How long had you been in South America by now?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Oh, a year and a half, something like that.</span> <span id="s412">And -- So then, other people asked me to run their farms for them.</span> <span id="s413">I had made many friends.</span> <span id="s414">But eventually I left Salta, I went to Chile and worked as athletic director for a -- a copper mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: That’s quite a switch isn’t it?</span> <span id="s416">Tobacco farmer to --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: That’s quite a switch, yup.</span> <span id="s418">I worked in Chookiecarnata in northern Chile and I went to Bolivia and I don’t know how much -- how many details you want, but I did many, many things over a relatively short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: What made you move again?</span> <span id="s420">A: Something didn’t work right, or somebody told me about a golden opportunity to drive cattle from Bolivia to Brazil, three months on horseback.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: I would like to sort of keep bringing us back when -- knowing, in your travels, your experience during the Holocaust, were these thought running through your head, of being in prison, or of what might be -- happened to your parents now, or do you remember thinking about the past?</span> <span id="s422">A: Well, you think of the past, except when -- when what happens to you is so rich in adventure, then you don’t have much of an opportunity.</span> <span id="s423">The past always comes back when you’re a little depressed, or when you have a lot of time.</span> <span id="s424">New things happen, you meet a new woman, you meet new friends, you -- things are going okay, you have a -- you’re going to a party, you have a ball, or you’re in danger.</span> <span id="s425">The good thing is that the Holocaust taught me to be able to be long times without food.</span> <span id="s426">I’m a very tough man.</span> <span id="s427">So, I always laugh, here in America, people -- people always starve.</span> <span id="s428">I am starved, I am starved, when they haven’t eaten for three hours, and they can’t live any longer without a Coke.</span> <span id="s429">You know, I go -- I drove yesterday non-stop 12 hours, doesn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s430">And I don’t stop to drink.</span> <span id="s431">No, I have a little bottle of water next to me.</span> <span id="s432">So -- So you -- you do think of the -- of the miserable parts in life when you’re depressed, when you’re miserable, then you think of more miserable things and eventually you feel sorry for yourselves.</span> <span id="s433">But if things go well, or new adventures happen, then you don’t think of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: So, how much longer were you in South America before you first went to the United States?</span> <span id="s435">A: First time I came to the United States on my way to Europe.</span> <span id="s436">I obtained a tourist visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: In Peru, to visit the United States as a visitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And you had been in South America for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, from ’49 to ’54, and -- which brings upon another -- another series of adventures.</span> <span id="s441">I came to -- to Miami --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Tell me what -- what it looked like to you when you landed.</span> <span id="s443">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Oh, I tell you, my first impression was that I went through immigration -- see, everywhere in the world you would be Mr. Meyer or Dr. Meyer, whatever the case may be.</span> <span id="s445">And the guy looked at me, he said, “Hi Walter.</span> <span id="s446">Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s447">And I thought, “Oh my God, these guys are the FBI, they know everything about you.”</span> <span id="s448">I was -- I was absolutely impressed that he would call me by my first name.</span> <span id="s449">Then, the casual way of being -- I remember in Miami at the time -- this was new to me, so I couldn’t get over these bathrooms, bathrooms for colored people.</span> <span id="s450">There -- There was no such a thing anywhere in the world, except South Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Had you been to South Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: No, I hadn’t been to South Africa, I went to South Africa later, but even South Africa, you didn’t have bathrooms for colored people, you just didn’t have bathrooms for colored people.</span> <span id="s453">But you didn’t have white and -- and -- and colored.</span> <span id="s454">So -- And the bus rides --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: You mean where people sat?</span> <span id="s456">A: Wh-Where people sat, blacks in the back and so on, that was totally new to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did you ever -- ever relate that to your experience in Germany, in relation to Jews?</span> <span id="s458">A: A-Absolutely.</span> <span id="s459">I often thought, they who tell us that we should not segregate, we should not do this, look at them, how they treat people just because they have a different color.</span> <span id="s460">That’s -- That’s -- I couldn’t quite cope with that.</span> <span id="s461">Another big disappointment was, I think it was July or August and it was hot in Miami and there was a Shriner’s convention and I could only find one room, in the upstairs of the Grellan Hotel, an old wooden hotel, and no air conditioning.</span> <span id="s462">And I bought some Cokes to put under the sheets.</span> <span id="s463">And then I went down, I saw a sign, I said, “Oh, I’m going to have a cold beer.”</span> <span id="s464">I had never in my life seen root beer.</span> <span id="s465">I thought root beer was just another beer.</span> <span id="s466">So I drank root beer, I still have the ugly taste in my mouth.</span> <span id="s467">Anyway, from Miami, I went to -- to Dallas --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Well, you were alone again?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Oh yeah, I was alone.</span> <span id="s470">I went to Dallas.</span> <span id="s471">I had known -- see, Braniff Airline had a headquarters in Peru.</span> <span id="s472">Peru was headquarters for the southern atmosphere, or southern -- southern region.</span> <span id="s473">She was an employee, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: A stewardess, a stewardess.</span> <span id="s476">And she lived in Dallas and she gave me her card, “When you come to Dallas, I want you to come and see me and I want you to meet my folks and I’ll show you around.”</span> <span id="s477">So I went to Dallas, and checked into the White Plaza Hotel, and I met her a day or two days later, and she said, “Walter, you’re spending a lot of money.</span> <span id="s478">The White Plaza Hotel is an expensive hotel,” [indecipherable] it was not too far from the airport and -- “Well, why don’t you check your suitcases in -- you put your suitcase into my car, we’re going to Oklahoma to see my folks, and on the way back, I check you into the YMCA.”</span> <span id="s479">That’s the way it happened, and the YMCA you don’t have bathrooms in your room, you have bathrooms down the floor, and somehow, while I took a shower, somebody swiped my money out of my suitcase, and I had maybe 10 or 20 dollars left.</span> <span id="s480">So, friends of this girl, one day they invited me to the first football game that I saw in my life, which -- which was so boring it was pathetic.</span> <span id="s481">Then they told that -- I wanted to go to California, see John Carroll, so they had told me that there were opportunities to drive a car.</span> <span id="s482">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: This is the end of tape one, side two.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: This is tape two, side one, of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, conducted with Walter Meyer, by Ginger Miles, on April 28th, 1999, in Austin, Texas.</span> <span id="s486">On the way to California --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Well, you know, in every town, if you, for example, your company moves you to New York, then you leave your car with the company and that gets a driver that drives the car, and generally gets an allowance of 30 dollars for gas, or something like that.</span> <span id="s488">So, I got one of those cars, a Chevrolet Bel Air, and drove from Dallas.</span> <span id="s489">And I had to deliver it in Salt Lake City.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: To do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Deliver the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Oh, deliver.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: And upon delivery, I would get 25 dollars.</span> <span id="s494">And I went through a little town close to Denver, called Castle Rock.</span> <span id="s495">Policeman stopped me, speeding and crossing the yellow line.</span> <span id="s496">And I remember he made it very clear, “You want to pay, or you want to see the judge?”</span> <span id="s497">I said, “I want to see the judge.”</span> <span id="s498">Well, the judge was not there, it’s 11 o’clock in the evening, so I went to jail.</span> <span id="s499">And I remember there was a cowboy in jail and I couldn’t understand a single word of what he was saying.</span> <span id="s500">Anyway, the next day, the sheriff came and took me to have some food and said, “Well, we have to keep you another day, we have to check on the car first.”</span> <span id="s501">Well, the next day I went to see the judge and the judge, there was no mercy, so it was the ticket plus court costs and I had a -- a ring, a gold ring from Peru, that the deputy sheriff went with me and -- to a restaurant and I told the people what my predicament was and somebody bought it for five or 10 dollars, I don’t remember how much.</span> <span id="s502">And somebody else, realizing that I was a foreigner and I need a little help, said, “Well, I tell you what, I’m going to contribute some gas to your car.”</span> <span id="s503">And I remember an old pump, that you had to move like that.</span> <span id="s504">And I was on my way.</span> <span id="s505">Shortly thereafter, a deer jumped right into the car and put a big dent in the fender.</span> <span id="s506">And I got out and I felt sorry for the deer, and I was going to catch him and see -- anyway, cars went by.</span> <span id="s507">Eventually the deer jumped back into the woods, limping.</span> <span id="s508">I drove on, police car stopped me.</span> <span id="s509">They took me to a little police station.</span> <span id="s510">“Anything you want to report?”</span> <span id="s511">“No.”</span> <span id="s512">“Nothing?”</span> <span id="s513">“No.”</span> <span id="s514">“Okay, you don’t want to tell us what happened?”</span> <span id="s515">I had no idea they were referring to the deer, I thought they meant that I was in jail the night before [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: So I said, “Well, I was in jail the night before.”</span> <span id="s518">“Oh, we got us a jailbird.”</span> <span id="s519">Well, finally they said, “For not reporting -- When you hit a deer and you don’t report, it’s 500 fine or 50 dollar fine,” it was a big amount for me.</span> <span id="s520">And I finally became furious and I said, “You know, I dreamed of this country many, many times.</span> <span id="s521">Of the liberal way, of democracy.</span> <span id="s522">When I came to this country, nobody ever stopped me and told me that if you hit a deer, you have to report.</span> <span id="s523">There’s no sign or anything for that.</span> <span id="s524">So, if you want to put me in jail, fine.”</span> <span id="s525">There was a captain or lieutenant, so he said, “Let him go.”</span> <span id="s526">So I was on my way again, came to Salt Lake City, delivered the car and they looked at the fender.</span> <span id="s527">They said, “Well, we owe you 25, the repair cost 18, so here’s seven dollars.”</span> <span id="s528">I had seven dollars in my pocket and I was in Salt Lake City, and I hadn’t slept well, I slept in the car.</span> <span id="s529">So I asked this auto auction, that’s what it was, would they allow me to leave my suitcases in one corner there and I wanted to see the city a little bit, so I walked through Salt Lake City and I saw a beautiful little house, room for rent.</span> <span id="s530">Oh, it was so inviting and I knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s531">So neat and clean.</span> <span id="s532">So I -- “Can I rent your room for a day or two?”</span> <span id="s533">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s534">“Okay.”</span> <span id="s535">And I slept, I slept beautifully and the next day I went to restaurant.</span> <span id="s536">I went to a stationery store and bought some drawing paper and a pencil, went to a restaurant, said, “Do you mind if I drew your picture?”</span> <span id="s537">He said -- I gave it to him, which always invited other people to look over your shoulder, “Would you do mine?”</span> <span id="s538">I said, “Two dollars,” or one dollar, I don’t remember how much I charged.</span> <span id="s539">So I was there for a couple of days, drawing pictures to make a little money, enough money to pay for the -- for my room.</span> <span id="s540">I went back and at the auto auction they told me that there were two soldiers.</span> <span id="s541">They were taking a car to Los Angeles and maybe they would give me a ride.</span> <span id="s542">I talked to them, they said, “Well, how about you pay your way and you do the driving?”</span> <span id="s543">I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s544">We drove from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas.</span> <span id="s545">At some service station, the soldier boys had flirted with two ladies, I think it was mother and daughter and had invited them to have a good time in Vegas.</span> <span id="s546">So in Vegas, they said goodbye to me, but they gave me a few dollars and said, “Why don’t you take the Greyhound bus?”</span> <span id="s547">I took the Greyhound bus, and arrived in Los Angeles and checked into the hotel across the Greyhound station.</span> <span id="s548">And from there I tried to reach John Carroll, no luck, until finally the operator told me, “No more telephone calls, you have to make a deposit first.”</span> <span id="s549">I left a suitcase, took bus and went up to the San Fernando Valley and eventually, oh, the first person I met was John Derek, who died not too long ago, Bo Derek’s husband, with whom I rode horses later on.</span> <span id="s550">And he told me how to find John Carroll, who came, and then they took me in a big, Buick convertible to Los Angeles, paid the hotel, get my suitcases and cunup -- come up and stay with them and -- but my experience at the United States, being in jail and the deer, and so on, if anybody had asked me, and I believe people asked me, “How do you like it here?”</span> <span id="s551">I would have said, “I hate it.</span> <span id="s552">I don’t like it at all.”</span> <span id="s553">The segregation policies and so on.</span> <span id="s554">It wasn’t -- I had not learned enough about America to -- to understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Well, you have to spend a little time in America to understand why Americans the way they are, their way of living, their heritage, the history of the Black and so on.</span> <span id="s557">It takes a little while to understand.</span> <span id="s558">Anyway, I left -- I left Los Angeles and took a plane from Burbank to New York and then from New York, I went to Germany, spent a little time and then eventually I returned to Peru.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: So, you got to see your parents again?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I went to see my parents and that was then --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Seven years?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And had the condition of Germany changed or improved?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah, considerably, because Germany was rebuilt maybe -- maybe throw a percentage at you, 60 percent.</span> <span id="s565">So, it was hardly recognizable.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And by now there was a government in place?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No, there was still -- yeah, ’54 there was -- oh, I have to do some thinking now.</span> <span id="s568">[inaudible] Yeah, there was now a German government, Attanower was chancellor and the trains were rolling on time and things had normalized.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: And your parents, how was that, to be reunited after seven years?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, it was -- My father had become my greatest fan, because to him, that a young man would be able to leave Germany, and make it all the way to America, that was -- he’d formed the -- the -- the admiration club.</span> <span id="s571">And he wanted me to stay and work with him.</span> <span id="s572">He had started a technical translation office.</span> <span id="s573">He was doing rather well.</span> <span id="s574">Semi-retired.</span> <span id="s575">In other words, he was his own man now, he was not an employee any longer.</span> <span id="s576">And -- But, once you have tasted any part of America, or for that matter, any part of America or Africa, then Germany, or Europe is not attractive any longer.</span> <span id="s577">Their way of living, the density of population, the -- the many, little problems that don’t exist here.</span> <span id="s578">The generous way of living versus existence in Europe.</span> <span id="s579">So, I couldn’t get used to the -- to the German way of living any more, I wanted to go back into the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: From Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Well, from Germany, I went back to Peru, which was -- which had become my home, and oh, I did a number of things, but ended up breeding some horses and --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: By now you spoke how many languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Oh, wa -- five.</span> <span id="s584">I had started a swimming school in Peru and I was coach of what they call the Peruvian Olympic team.</span> <span id="s585">And many people in Peru believed, like people all over the world, I assume, that polio was contagious.</span> <span id="s586">And parents of polio affected children knew that water was very good, called hydrotherapy, or water therapy, and they wanted me to take care of their children.</span> <span id="s587">But the others, when they heard that I was going to deal with polio children, they kind of shied away, being afraid that it would be contagious.</span> <span id="s588">So, I kind of concentrated with them during lunchtime.</span> <span id="s589">From 12 to two, I had nothing but polio affected children.</span> <span id="s590">I became extremely successful, economically and in every way and I then dreamed of having -- well, I have to explain, when you go from Lima east, for about -- less than an hour, and you come to an area where the sun shines, while right in Lima, a situation is a little bit like Los Angeles, the mountains push the clouds back, so you have this dampness over Lima.</span> <span id="s591">It never rains, but you don’t see much of a blue sky, but you go a little inwards, the sky is blue, the sun shines and wealthy people begin to have beautiful homes there.</span> <span id="s592">And in that area, I wanted to build the most elegant swimming school, where people could have a cup of coffee and watch through one-sided glass, see their children and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s593">Well, I had a child in my school, that learned to take the first steps.</span> <span id="s594">Her father was president and owner of one of the largest bank houses.</span> <span id="s595">And he told me that any money that I needed, would be made available.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Was he grateful to you for --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s598">He just couldn’t get over that I was able to make his -- his grandchild walk.</span> <span id="s599">So I said, “Well, at least I would like to have the land and maybe then you can help me to finance the rest, any time.”</span> <span id="s600">Well, that was a project that I was very much involved with, and a friend of mine, a Swiss architect, helped me to design something which was partly underground.</span> <span id="s601">Well, at that time, somebody had inquired about the Peruvian passel horse, which is a very special breed of horses and -- and I was involved a little, I had a few horses myself and I loved them because they’re very elegant, they have a beautiful gait.</span> <span id="s602">And the horse association’s secretary called me and they didn’t quite know how to handle this request from the United States and so I kind of took over and eventually the idea developed to take 12 stallions to the United States.</span> <span id="s603">Shortly before that time, I have to explain; Peruvian parents, parents of polio children used to go to Warm Springs, Georgia with their children.</span> <span id="s604">But eventually, they thought, why not bring a doctor down here?</span> <span id="s605">We give him a car and a chauffeur, it’s cheaper and we don’t lose that much time.</span> <span id="s606">So, a doctor came from Georgia and I was introduced to him and he was rather complimentary as to the fine work I had done, and I told him that everything I did was based upon common sense, but I had no schooling in water therapy, but I would like very much to pursue some kind of course.</span> <span id="s607">And he invited me to come to Warm Springs, Georgia.</span> <span id="s608">I thought, I get a diploma that I can hang on the wall and -- and then I know what I’m doing, and take it from there.</span> <span id="s609">So, I was asked to establish contact with horse loving people and I made the same mistake that everybody else makes, and that is everybody believes that Texas is the horsey-est state in the nation.</span> <span id="s610">It’s not, California is, by far.</span> <span id="s611">So I wrote to Texas and oh, I ended up with the Good Neighbor commission, the governor and eventually, I don’t remember how, but I ended up with the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, and I was told that we would escort the governor with our horses, during the Battle of Flowers parade, which is Texas Independence Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So you had two businesses going on in Peru.</span> <span id="s613">One was the water therapy and swimming and the other was the Peruvian horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yeah, the Peruvian horses was not a business, was -- was a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Pleasure?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: But you are now preparing, I thought, to Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yeah, well, what I -- what I -- what I thought was, we take the horses, get a lot of money for the horses and from there, go to Warm Springs, Georgia.</span> <span id="s619">And then I return, and I have money to buy land, to build my school and so on.</span> <span id="s620">Well, we had sent some photographs -- a few photographs of horses to San Antonio and the lady at the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, gave those pictures to a guy who had Palomino horses.</span> <span id="s621">And he looked at the pictures and they saw they were white -- not all Peruvian horses are white, but those particular pictures happened to be of -- of a couple of white stallions and he put two and two together, white, Spanish, those must be Lipisotter horses.</span> <span id="s622">We had quoted some -- We had given them a price idea, so I thought that was rather cheap.</span> <span id="s623">So I got a letter that all the horses are placed.</span> <span id="s624">And so I said, “Well, they’re sold, let’s go.”</span> <span id="s625">I had two horses of my own and others smelled the business, said, “Walter, why don’t you take mine?”</span> <span id="s626">And there was an American who had a freight line.</span> <span id="s627">He had an old flying boxcar, and we put 12 stallions in there, had two helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: On the plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Put them on the plane and we shot each one with tranquilizer, so they stood like the wings.</span> <span id="s630">Went to Panama, landed in Panama, were a little late, we couldn’t -- we couldn’t unload the horses because of quarantine regulations, so we tried to water them, lost a lot of time.</span> <span id="s631">Then -- In retrospect, I understand that he didn’t have a -- a landing permit for Houston, but we kind of made an emergency landing.</span> <span id="s632">One of the horses had gone with the hoofs, had stood up with the hoofs, broke the window of the plane.</span> <span id="s633">I mean, it was a disaster, but we -- we made it in Houston.</span> <span id="s634">We were not able to unload the horses.</span> <span id="s635">They went from the plane on a truck and they dusted us and the horses and the quarantine officers were there.</span> <span id="s636">It was the biggest mess.</span> <span id="s637">And then -- I had been told that horses for breeding do not pay duty.</span> <span id="s638">Well, I was told that, but in reality, it’s horses for breeding, if you’re an American citizen, you bring horses for breeding, you don’t pay duty, but as a foreigner, you bring in horses, you do pay duty.</span> <span id="s639">We were not prepared to pay.</span> <span id="s640">We -- We prepared to cash.</span> <span id="s641">So, the guy with the big truck was told, “Don’t unload the horses until you get the money.”</span> <span id="s642">Jack Sellars was the guy with the Palomino horses in San Antonio, who was called and he said, “I’ll take care of it, just bring the horses over here and I give you the money to pay for customs and so on.”</span> <span id="s643">Well, th-the driver of the big truck, 18 wheeler, was Black and fell asleep while he was driving.</span> <span id="s644">So I took over, drove to San Antonio, and while he was asleep -- oh, Jack Sellars was there waiting for us and I realized he -- he realized that he had made a mistake, we didn’t have Lipisotter horses, and Jack Sellars kind of disappeared.</span> <span id="s645">We were at the coliseum in San Antonio with 12 horse, I said, “Unload the horses, before he wakes up.”</span> <span id="s646">And I told him, “Go back and don’t worry, we’ll pay sooner or later.”</span> <span id="s647">Well, the press came and there I was with 12 stallion and two helpers, so the president of Lone Star Brewing Company, Harry Jerzek, bought three horses, for way below our costs.</span> <span id="s648">People always take advantage.</span> <span id="s649">That was enough money to send the guys home and I was alone with nine horses.</span> <span id="s650">And horses eat more than people do.</span> <span id="s651">So that’s the way it started.</span> <span id="s652">Harry Jerzek was a very important figure and he introduced me to people here and there and he organized a race, an endurance race from San Antonio [indecipherable] 34 miles on the Fourth of July, 1958.</span> <span id="s653">And I had coached a cowboy to go with me, and we rode each a Peruvian horse and we won.</span> <span id="s654">And we were to cash 500 dollars, but then we were told, “No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s655">The 500 dollars would have been to anybody who would beat you.</span> <span id="s656">Nobody beat you, so there’s no money.”</span> <span id="s657">I didn’t understand that too well, but anyway.</span> <span id="s658">Then, as we arrived, I tied one horse up and the little lady felt sorry for the horse, because the horse was totally exhausted and I gave him water, which was the worst thing to do.</span> <span id="s659">Th-The horse died the next day.</span> <span id="s660">So I lost one horse.</span> <span id="s661">Well, there I was now with eight horses.</span> <span id="s662">And well, not too long thereafter, I placed some horses, see, “Can I leave some horses on pasture with you?”</span> <span id="s663">“Yeah, sure.”</span> <span id="s664">You become known, you make friends, you meet people.</span> <span id="s665">And I bought an old truck converted it and made it two stalls.</span> <span id="s666">I said, “I’m going to try my luck,” and took two horses to California.</span> <span id="s667">And so then I spend time in -- in California, placed some horses and --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Is this where you met Clark Gable?</span> <span id="s669">A: Met Clark Gable -- Yeah, I met Clark Gable at the time.</span> <span id="s670">I was in Palm Springs and Frank Bogartwo was Mayor of Palm Springs, twice.</span> <span id="s671">Told me once, “Why don’t you come along, we need -- we need an extra bowler.”</span> <span id="s672">And so I bowled with Clark Gable.</span> <span id="s673">And I think Zsa Zsa Gabor was on the other team and a bunch of people.</span> <span id="s674">Clark Gable was an extremely nice man, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s675">There, I’m with Clark Gable.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: You have a picture of that time, or are you going to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yeah, it’s that time, I show it to you.</span> <span id="s678">While I was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Now, who’s in that picture, the picture you just showed me, who was in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: That’s Clark Gable and his wife, Kay.</span> <span id="s681">And, at the time, Clark Gable was trying to lose a little weight and he had a bet going on with a na -- a guy by the name of Ray Rand and whoever loses the bowling will have to lose an extra 10 pounds.</span> <span id="s682">So he wrote on the photo, “Thanks for the bowling,” because we won it, he didn’t have to lose an extra 10 pounds.</span> <span id="s683">Clark Gable was one of the most decent man I met in Hollywoods, which is the phoniest place on earth, probably.</span> <span id="s684">I met many, some were very nice and some invited me.</span> <span id="s685">I rode horses two or three times with Walt Disney, who invited me to see Disneyland, and not only see Disneyland, but see behind, where they repaired carriages and did all the maintenance work and so on.</span> <span id="s686">That was quite nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I’m assuming this is beyond another trip than the one that you took the two horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: That was -- That was the -- the one with the two horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So, you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yeah, well, I came back to Texas, took care of a few things, maybe sold two horses to Mr. Masterson in Houston, then went back to California.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Land of promise?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s693">And rode horses with Anthony Quinn and John Derek.</span> <span id="s694">We used to practice fast draw.</span> <span id="s695">And I stayed at John Carroll’s house in Granada Hills, with Wade Preston.</span> <span id="s696">Wade Preston was the star of Colt 45, which was a st -- a dumb, stupid western series.</span> <span id="s697">Anyway, I met Jack Warner once, in the desert.</span> <span id="s698">And that was the time when the studios had kind of re-organized and would offer you a s -- I think it was 600 dollars that I was offered, 600 dollars per month for five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: For what?</span> <span id="s700">A: To be on contract.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: This is side B, tape two, of interview with Walter Meyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: So I’m in California now, and -- and what I tried to explain to you, that studios, once they felt that they had discovered a star, or someone they could make a star, they offered all kind of monies.</span> <span id="s704">The new policy was, let’s pay them 600 dollars per month for five years.</span> <span id="s705">If they become stars, we make a lot of money, because we don’t pay them any more than 600 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s706">And if they do not become stars, we don’t lose much with 600 dollars.</span> <span id="s707">That was a time when Burns -- you na -- remember Kookie, with the comb?</span> <span id="s708">Well, he was trying to make -- he became quite popular with the kids.</span> <span id="s709">He was making 600 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s710">I had signed a contract, because I had met Jack Warner, who invited me and said, “Why don’t you try it out?”</span> <span id="s711">I thought, “Why not become a movie star?”</span> <span id="s712">So I signed a contract, which I broke shortly thereafter, because Frank Bogert, my very dear friend, one day said, “Do you want to meet President Eisenhower?</span> <span id="s713">He’s in -- in Indio,” or one of the desert places.</span> <span id="s714">And I met President Eisenhower, who had started the People to People program, which was kind of a forerunner of the Alliance for Progress.</span> <span id="s715">And he said, “Why don’t you do some good will,” and so on, and that appealed to me much more than Hollywood.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Why do you think that is?</span> <span id="s717">Why do you think you were inspired t -- for good will?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Going from North America to South America overland?</span> <span id="s719">My God, this was -- this was an adventure.</span> <span id="s720">I mean, you could hardly drive.</span> <span id="s721">So, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So, it was to serve people from --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: It -- It -- It -- The -- The -- The philosophy behind was to bring people closer together, so we would understand better, our brothers south of the border.</span> <span id="s724">And so I met, well, all the presidents going down.</span> <span id="s725">And I drove, I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: [indecipherable] with me from Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s728">I came through Texas, then I went all the way to Peru.</span> <span id="s729">So I did that, and of course, by that time, I had had a fine opportunity to become acquainted with life in the United States.</span> <span id="s730">I had met friends and I had decided that I would return and live in Texas, or at least try to make a living here.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Why Texas over California?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Because I knew more people in Texas than in California, and -- and palm -- as a matter of fact, I wanted to return to Palm Springs.</span> <span id="s733">There was a lady who wanted me to run a spa, with an emphasis on physical education and -- but she -- she had a heart attack, she died, so that never -- never became true.</span> <span id="s734">So it’s not that I absolutely wanted to become the te -- wanted to come to Texas, I wanted to come to California, but I also had friends here.</span> <span id="s735">So eventually, I returned overland to --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: In a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: In a camper, to the United States and came to Texas and I was then introduced to then vice president Linden Johnson at his ranch.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: So this would have been 1962?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yes, that sounds good.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: And how did you get to go there to the ranch, how did that happen?</span> <span id="s741">A: Harry Jerzek, of Lonestar Brewing Company, kn-knew Linden Johnson well and felt that a man of my caliber should be -- should be welcome by the president and -- well, by the vice president then, and so he made arrangement and I was told to come on such and such a day, I think it was a Sunday morning that I met Linden Johnson.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: And your first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: My first impression was the same as the second and third impression, that he was a rather unpleasant man.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Later, as I came to know him better, and traveled with him a couple of times to Mexico, he would be the extreme of a charming man, and would say, “Walter my man, how are you?</span> <span id="s746">How is -- How’s the family?”</span> <span id="s747">And the next day he would look through you, as if you didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s748">A man he was, who was used to having people do anything for him.</span> <span id="s749">Took advantage of his power and of course, remember those who did things for him.</span> <span id="s750">But not a pleasant man, not my kind of man.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Now, I’m -- I’m interested in LBJ very much, but I’m also interested in the fact that he asked you how was your family.</span> <span id="s752">Now, is this literal, did you by now have a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Oh yeah, I married a -- a Peruvian girl when I arrived in Lima, I married a girl that I had known for some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: In -- That would have been 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: So by then you were with her, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah, well I brought her with me overland.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: You brought her with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s760">And we had -- we had our first child, Heidi, born in ’62.</span> <span id="s761">So that is why the question, how is the family.</span> <span id="s762">Matter of fact, when he asked me how is the family, there was already number two.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: And Lady Bird, did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh yeah, I know Lady Bird well, she’s one of the most delightful ladies that you could possibly meet, very considerate.</span> <span id="s765">But, you know, I know Lucy, I know Linda.</span> <span id="s766">I taught Linda’s children how to swim.</span> <span id="s767">But, when you -- when you ask somebody, “Did you know?”</span> <span id="s768">And I think the question should be, “Have you met?”</span> <span id="s769">Because you don’t really know those people intimately.</span> <span id="s770">Yeah, I’ve -- I’ve been with Lady Bird several times.</span> <span id="s771">She sent me a picture not too -- too long ago.</span> <span id="s772">I had -- I had done a Blue Bonnet painting for her.</span> <span id="s773">So, I’ll show you that picture in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: So would you have been in -- Did you settle in Austin?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: When I came back -- When I came back, I settled first in San Antonio, because the president of Peru asked me to represent the country as Consul and later as Consul General.</span> <span id="s776">One day I had to deliver a speech at the University of Texas, as a diplomat.</span> <span id="s777">And my speech must have been somewhat radical.</span> <span id="s778">Talk about the Alliance for Progress.</span> <span id="s779">The one who had sponsored the speech, was the late George Sanchez.</span> <span id="s780">They named the College of Education after him.</span> <span id="s781">George Sanchez was one of the most outstanding, finest human beings I ever met.</span> <span id="s782">And we became friends.</span> <span id="s783">And he said, “I would love to have you with me in graduate school.”</span> <span id="s784">Said, “I don’t have any transcripts or anything.</span> <span id="s785">I would love to join you.”</span> <span id="s786">“Well, I would rather have you without transcripts than all these monkeys,” and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s787">Well, he wrote a letter to the registrar.</span> <span id="s788">The letter was cosigned by the late William Drake, Professor Drake.</span> <span id="s789">They asked that I be admitted and I assume the registrar didn’t quite know what to do with me, but he couldn’t -- he couldn’t just do that.</span> <span id="s790">I mean, I had nothing to show.</span> <span id="s791">So, they referred the letter to the graduate dean, who was out of town, so it went to the associate graduate dean, Lahor Hughes.</span> <span id="s792">Wonderful guy, who said to himself, according to him, if two professor write letter like that and want this guy so badly in graduate school, I want to meet that man.</span> <span id="s793">So he called me and he talked to me for an hour and a half and he said, “I’m impressed.</span> <span id="s794">Would you consider it fair if I called for a special committee and let the committee decide whether you should be admitted or not?”</span> <span id="s795">“Yes,”[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: And you had not gone to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: No.</span> <span id="s798">So the committee met and unanimously recommended that -- that I be accepted and three years later -- oh, I drove from San Antonio to Austin every day for three years, and got my Ph.D., and --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: In?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: In history and philosophy of education.</span> <span id="s801">That was the first of three Ph.D.’s.</span> <span id="s802">Then I ran the center for international education, became quite involved in academic life, trying to -- to bring professor from other countries to interchange, by way of education understand better, what makes other people tick, about their culture and so on.</span> <span id="s803">But, we didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s804">The monies went into aerospace.</span> <span id="s805">You couldn’t get any money at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: This was early 60’s?</span> <span id="s807">Mid 60’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s809">So, eventually I left and then associated with Walter Jenkins, who was Linden’s first secretary.</span> <span id="s810">This was the t-time when Mr. Johnson left Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Where were you when Kennedy was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: On the way to Houston.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: On the way to Houston.</span> <span id="s814">So we’re talking a -- a year -- a few years after.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: My father had sent a car that I was going to pick up at the port of Houston.</span> <span id="s816">And I had a Black guy with me whom I -- I loved dearly, good mechanic.</span> <span id="s817">And we stopped in one of those little towns between here and Houston.</span> <span id="s818">And I said, “Let’s have something to eat.”</span> <span id="s819">And the guy said, “He’s not going to eat here, he has to eat in the kitchen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: And so this was pre-’65?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No, that was ’63.</span> <span id="s822">Yeah, ’63.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: That was the day that -- th -- th -- th -- the day Kennedy was killed.</span> <span id="s825">So I said, “Well, do you mind if we,”-- w-we were four.</span> <span id="s826">“Can we all sit in the kitchen together?”</span> <span id="s827">“Yeah, I don’t mind.”</span> <span id="s828">So -- And I think I was a little nasty like.</span> <span id="s829">I hope you don’t expect a tip or something like that.</span> <span id="s830">You know, I was a little disturbed that --</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Were all the others Black?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s833">There was only one Black and the others were a little embarrassed about the situation then.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: But they truly let you sit in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s836">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s837">So, as we left, we heard a loudspeaker of a radio, President Kennedy was shot, and shortly thereafter, where he’s dead.</span> <span id="s838">So that was on the way to Houston and of course Mr. Johnson became president, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Did you have any dealings with him while he was president?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s841">So, let’s see, I left the university, I believe in ’67.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: From the -- You got another Ph.D.</span> <span id="s843">?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Not from this university.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s847">I left the university in ’67, I was [indecipherable] work with Walter and all that, become all kinds of different things that I could tell you, but I don’t believe that we want to go into effen -- every little detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Had you yet become a resident and citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yeah, well -- Oh, yeah, I had become a resident, because even before I left for Peru on this overland trip, before -- I had gone to immigration a number of times, to extend my visitor’s visa, until one day, the offer said, “Well Walter, don’t you think that by this time you should know whether you like it here or not?”</span> <span id="s850">Those were his exact words.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Who said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: The -- The immigration officer.</span> <span id="s853">And I said, “Yes, what can I do about it?”</span> <span id="s854">He said, “Well, we can -- let’s go into change of status and make you a resident.”</span> <span id="s855">“Okay.”</span> <span id="s856">Then I had to undergo a physical examination and they said, “Well, we cannot okay it, w-we have to take another x-ray, because,” -- the x-ray of my lungs revealed tuberculosis, but they didn’t know whether it was active or whether it was scar tissue.</span> <span id="s857">And I don’t remember why I had to go to New York, but I said, “Why can’t I speed up the process?”</span> <span id="s858">And I went to Staten Island and another x-ray is taken, they realized it was scar tissue, then they okayed it, I became a resident.</span> <span id="s859">Shortly -- Well, we didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s860">I think I took a trip once, to Oklahoma for President Johnson --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: While he was president?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: For the former president, I meant.</span> <span id="s863">You still call him president, of course, but he was not in Washington any more.</span> <span id="s864">And whenever -- wherever I went, oh yes, somebody said, “What would you like to eat?</span> <span id="s865">Wa -- I take you here, you know somebody who would pick you up at the airport.”</span> <span id="s866">And I went to -- “How about some German food?”</span> <span id="s867">And I tasted the sausages, I said, “These are German sausage, these are not American sausages.”</span> <span id="s868">Well, I found out that there was a German butcher in Dallas.</span> <span id="s869">And I had the idea of opening a little German restaurant, as an investor, in Austin, which became probably the most successful restaurant in Austin, called Hansel and Gretel.</span> <span id="s870">Any of the old-timers will tell you, we had classes there, we have weddings there.</span> <span id="s871">I -- We gave five scholarships each year to the University of Texas.</span> <span id="s872">I mean, it was packed at all times.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Well, what years were that -- was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: That was ’69 through ’74.</span> <span id="s875">I never thought of running it, but one day I came back from a trip and I had a few partners, Walter -- Walter Jenkins was one.</span> <span id="s876">And I didn’t know how much we owed and I -- I had a certain liability there.</span> <span id="s877">I said, “I’m going to take over.”</span> <span id="s878">I took over and -- and it became quite a thing, Hansel and Gretel, so I ran that.</span> <span id="s879">That unfortunately, or fortunately, became part of the divorce settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: From the first, Peruvian wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: And, so then, when I left the --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: You were divorced in what year?</span> <span id="s885">A: Oh, that must have been ’74 or ’75.</span> <span id="s886">Then, I -- I had learned, in one opportunity, I had become a little interested in hypnosis.</span> <span id="s887">And there was a professor of psychology at southwest Texas State University in San Marcus.</span> <span id="s888">We became friends and I went to see him.</span> <span id="s889">We had another restaurant there, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: What was that called?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Hansel and Gretel.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s893">A branch of Hansel and Gretel.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yeah, and in one room, he sometimes had a class meeting in that party room and he would have some -- show hypnosis a little.</span> <span id="s895">So, we became friends and he said, “Why don’t you become a little involved.</span> <span id="s896">Your -- You’re pretty good at it and use -- use it in -- in -- in therapy.”</span> <span id="s897">That was quite appealing to me.</span> <span id="s898">But I said, “Hell, I need -- I need a degree in psychology.”</span> <span id="s899">So I went to the University of Texas and they -- I went before the graduate council.</span> <span id="s900">“No, we cannot give you second Ph.D.” I went to see Charles Lamader, the chancellor of the university, whom I had met.</span> <span id="s901">And he recommended that I go to the University of Texas in San Antonio.</span> <span id="s902">They had just begun a program in psychology and that I was going to take classes at the University of Texas, but San Antonio would give me credit for it and well, the way it worked out, their program was never approved, so all the courses they took were for the birds.</span> <span id="s903">And eventually, I read that there was a graduate school in San Francisco, which had started with Pomeroy, who was the right hand man of -- of Kinsey.</span> <span id="s904">Started the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality.</span> <span id="s905">And I became very much interested, because I felt that most psychological problems are sexual in nature, if you see human sexuality with a very broad context.</span> <span id="s906">So I wrote and yes, I was accepted.</span> <span id="s907">Went there and while I was there, I was asked to do a little lecturing at Antioch University.</span> <span id="s908">They had a campus on the west coast.</span> <span id="s909">And they ga -- they decided to give me credit for the courses I had taken at the University of Texas, so eventually I got a Master’s degree in psychology from Antioch University.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: From which?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Antioch.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Oh, Antioch.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Antioch.</span> <span id="s914">And then eventually, I went to Columbia Pacific.</span> <span id="s915">They accepted me and recognized, of course, my Master’s degree and I did some work with them and got my Ph.D. in psychology and eventually I got a third one from the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, in San Francisco, so that was my third.</span> <span id="s916">Let’s see, where are we?</span> <span id="s917">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Education, we’re doing your education.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Yeah, then I did some research, mostly with Dr. Singh, professor of psychology.</span> <span id="s920">We wrote a paper together with -- was with -- published in England.</span> <span id="s921">And then I decided that -- that I -- well, li -- let’s not talk about economy.</span> <span id="s922">In the 60’s -- no, in the early 80’s, I lost about half a million dollars, like everybody else, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Your business was the restaurant and teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: No, the restaurant, I had invested in real estate and -- and because of my -- my connection with the Johnsons, I had a friend who was Chairman of the Board of -- of the Bank of the Hills, which was a bank owned by the -- the Johnsons.</span> <span id="s925">So, Walter, how much do you need?</span> <span id="s926">So I could get any amount of money.</span> <span id="s927">This was a period of speculation.</span> <span id="s928">Properties change hands three times per day sometimes and each time they went up and then everything fell, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: When was that?</span> <span id="s930">When was the big fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: The early 80’s.</span> <span id="s932">So I lost too much money and bankruptcy was a little against my religion and I began to paint, as a kind of therapy.</span> <span id="s933">I had been a -- at the Academy of Fine Arts in Düsseldorf as a boy.</span> <span id="s934">I did a painting of the famous conductor, Carrian.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Where is he from?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Carrian was the -- the -- the -- the head of the Salzburg or -- the Salzburg’s Philharmonic Orchestra.</span> <span id="s937">And somebody from Switzerland came to visit and -- and was crazy about this painting I had done of Carrian.</span> <span id="s938">And I got a letter, “Would you send a picture?”</span> <span id="s939">And eventually, to make the story short, “Would you sell it and how much?”</span> <span id="s940">And I remember my daughter was with me, I said, “Do you think 2000 dollars is too much?”</span> <span id="s941">She said, “If you sell this painting for 2000, I’ll never talk to you again.”</span> <span id="s942">I said, “Well, how much?”</span> <span id="s943">“10,000.”</span> <span id="s944">I -- Well, the Swiss have money so I -- 10,000 and they paid 10,000.</span> <span id="s945">Then I was invited to have a show in Europe.</span> <span id="s946">Carrian asked me to do a painting for the Vatican.</span> <span id="s947">So I did a painting for the Pope and I was asked to come to Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Which Pope?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: The present one, John Paul, and you will see me with the Pope on the picture as we come down.</span> <span id="s950">And then I had several shows in Europe.</span> <span id="s951">I had a lot of money and I paid what I owed.</span> <span id="s952">And I have been happy ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Well, now your daughter is -- you discussed, is from the first marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah, I have three children out of the first marriage, one died not too long ago, so there is a girl who is, What is Heidi, 35.</span> <span id="s955">She had three children, she is in west Texas, she is a rancher’s wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Where in west Texas?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: At Saint Angelo.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: I’m from Abalone, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s960">And then there’s a boy who is here, he’s a very prominent man.</span> <span id="s961">God knows what all he does.</span> <span id="s962">And -- And by sheer coincidence, one day on the way to the university, on a rainy, cold, miserable day, I was driving and I saw this student, I assume, missing the shuttlebus to the university and I stopped and I said, “I’m going to the university, I don’t want you to miss classes.”</span> <span id="s963">She became my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Your present wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: She is Chinese and she is probably the -- not probably, she is without any doubt the finest human being I ever met in my life.</span> <span id="s966">And with her I have Asai, who was born what, 16 months ago.</span> <span id="s967">So this is the beginning of the final chapter of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: With a new family.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s971">So, before we go now, between your family and your education, the return to -- I can’t say it right, Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s974">Is there anything else you want to fill in, as far as your history, before we return?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s976">There are so many things, but I don’t believe that they would contribute much.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s978">I’m interested in -- in how this -- how you got reconnected with your roots in Germany and with the Holocaust, and what led you to return.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, after my parents died, my father was born in a small, little town -- as a matter of fact, my cousin is visiting from Germany.</span> <span id="s980">I have relatives on both sides, Germany and Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Your father died in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: My father died in ’73, and so it is not that I have a tremendous, strong feeling towards my roots.</span> <span id="s983">I’m very attached to the little town in which I spent part of my childhood taking care of the cows and milking the cows and where I have some relatives left, and where I like to go, with their buis -- beautiful forests.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: That town is?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: That -- That little town of 600 people is called Holleaerath, H-o-l-l-e-a-e-r-a-t-h.</span> <span id="s986">Matter of fact, a friend of mine just wrote a book about the Jews in that part.</span> <span id="s987">He gave me his book, the Jews in -- in that part of Germany, the development, the history of the Jews there and so on, it’s quite, quite interesting.</span> <span id="s988">Their names and what they did and so on.</span> <span id="s989">So, it is not so much Germany, I’m -- I am as much attached to -- to, now Libya and to South Africa, as I am to Texas, so I don’t have these enormous roots, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: All right, before we go to Ravensbrück, I think I should turn over to the next side --</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: -- to the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: This is tape three, side one, of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Walter Meyer, conducted by Ginger Miles, on April 28th, 1999, in Austin, Texas.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s997">We can always get together again.</span> <span id="s998">I don’t know, you asked me the question, what would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: I’d like to focus on the place that was a concentration camp, and where you ended up and maybe if you could just give us a little background about when you were there the first time, just like a paragraph or something, and then about your return trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Well, the first time was in 1944.</span> <span id="s1001">Went to Sachsenhausen first and from Sachsenhausen, went to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1002">Of course, Ravensbrück was a very small camp.</span> <span id="s1003">Ravensbrück consisted mainly of satellite camps.</span> <span id="s1004">Ravensbrück acted as a -- as a headquarters.</span> <span id="s1005">And I went to one of those satellite camps, but they all were under the umbrella of Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: This is from prison, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: From prison to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1008">Concentration camp, to ma -- to me, was actually an improvement, because I was in solitary confinement in the prison.</span> <span id="s1009">The concentration camp, at least you can talk to others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: And you were considered a political prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: I was considered a political prisoner.</span> <span id="s1012">So, in that concentration camp, did not mean as much as the word implies.</span> <span id="s1013">To me, it was not getting worse.</span> <span id="s1014">As a matter of fact, it was getting a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: You didn’t fear for your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: No, I feared for my life, but not -- not of being killed, rather, a-a-a-a-at the very end, I feared I was -- I was afraid I would die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Because you were sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Because I was -- I was sick.</span> <span id="s1019">See, I had tried to escape, I had done several things.</span> <span id="s1020">My conduct in prison was so that three times I was put in the bunker, for one month each time, with 200 grams of bread and butter, I -- bread and -- and water.</span> <span id="s1021">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: You were only wishing for butter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1024">So that puts you down pretty fast.</span> <span id="s1025">And then, where they needed soldiers, I was called and I was told that I should be ready, I would be transferred to a penal company, which meant the first line.</span> <span id="s1026">And I refused, because I was in no condition to be a soldier.</span> <span id="s1027">That refusal prompted then, the transfer to a camp, to a work camp.</span> <span id="s1028">And Ravensbrück was a work camp, as a matter of fact, one of the toughest work camps.</span> <span id="s1029">So, the first time I went to Germany, I had decided, beyond any doubt whatsover, to visit the warden of the prison in which I had spent about a year, and kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Is this Spider?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1032">And I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: When was this that you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Oh, that was when I went in -- I assume that was when I went back in ’54, after the -- after seven years.</span> <span id="s1035">And, you know, I -- I had made up my mind to say, “Do you remember me?</span> <span id="s1036">May I refresh your memory?”</span> <span id="s1037">And then eventually I would have killed him.</span> <span id="s1038">And I knocked at the door, and a lady came.</span> <span id="s1039">I said, “I come to see Dr. Soikner.”</span> <span id="s1040">She said, “Well, I’m very sorry, but he’s no longer here, he moved to Hamburg.”</span> <span id="s1041">Well, that of course changed the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1042">I was not about now to take the next train to Hamburg, because from Frankfurt to Hamburg is a long way.</span> <span id="s1043">So, I kind of -- kind of forgot it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: May I ask you here, then it had been seven years, and even more than that from the time that you were in the camp, or in the prison, and you carried this hate.</span> <span id="s1045">Why - I don’t -- I know that he was aw -- in -- very, very bad to you, but can you figure out any other reason why you carried this hate toward him?</span> <span id="s1046">Was it more than just him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Oh, because I don’t believe that -- well, I never understand how man can be so evil to man.</span> <span id="s1048">That’s -- That’s -- I have never come to understand that.</span> <span id="s1049">This particular man had no right whatsoever, to be so cruel, so sadistic, to a boy of 16 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: He was beating you, and more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Well, he was not beating me personally, but he ordered that I be beaten, he ordered that I be put into a little cell with nothing but two slices of bread for -- for four weeks.</span> <span id="s1052">This was the ultimate of cruelty, but he was a sadistic man, who -- and there are millions like that in the world.</span> <span id="s1053">So, he’s just one of them.</span> <span id="s1054">But I carried his image with him and -- and I still dream of him, once in awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: You still dream of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1059">Yeah, I still dream of him.</span> <span id="s1060">Once in awhile I see myself -- I do a lot of scribbling with a pencil and I see myself doing his profile.</span> <span id="s1061">I say, “Dammit, why do I do this?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: What do you mean by doing his profile?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Oh, I start drawing and before I know it, I have his nose and I have his profile there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Maybe he represented, because I know, from your childhood on, with your father as mentor, you were anti-authoritarian.</span> <span id="s1065">So, it’s terrible for anyone to be in prison, but for someone who is as anti-authoritarian as you, perhaps could he have represented something greater than just himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Yes, that is -- that is -- that is very true.</span> <span id="s1067">I mean, I was very much like putting an eagle in a cage.</span> <span id="s1068">I was free.</span> <span id="s1069">I was supposed to be born in Texas, the son of a big rancher, see?</span> <span id="s1070">But it didn’t happen that way.</span> <span id="s1071">So, yes, I hated him passionately, I mean passionately.</span> <span id="s1072">I don’t know in retrospect -- these are all good questions, and nobody can answer -- what would have happened if I had killed him?</span> <span id="s1073">Would I have sleepless nights over him?</span> <span id="s1074">I don’t know that, it didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Well, this brings up a comment that you did make, that you have killed and I just wondered, although I know it may be very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1076">Can -- Can you say what -- what circumstances you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Well, I -- When I went into the western zone -- see the Russians -- Americans were very nice and they picked up scientists and brought them over here.</span> <span id="s1078">Like Werner Ferbrown and son.</span> <span id="s1079">The Russians would ship anybody to Russia, and they would do the screening in Russia.</span> <span id="s1080">If you were an engineer, fine, if not, well we can -- we can still use you.</span> <span id="s1081">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: They were not as discriminant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Oh no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1084">They could use all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1085">So one day we were stopped at a border crossing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: This was around what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Oh, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: -- ’47 -- ’46.</span> <span id="s1090">End of ’46, maybe.</span> <span id="s1091">And I had a young lady with me who was -- well, in my area I had become somewhat o-of an expert.</span> <span id="s1092">I had gone twice into the Russian zone, “Let’s go with Walter, he knows his way.”</span> <span id="s1093">Well, we were stopped, taken to an old forest ranger’s office, and some of the women were raped.</span> <span id="s1094">And we were marched, and I knew, from here, by train, we’ll end up in Russia.</span> <span id="s1095">And an elderly guard with a machine gun was behind us, and I began to have like epileptic attacks, just to see how he would react.</span> <span id="s1096">And finally I got hold of his gun and killed him.</span> <span id="s1097">So that was one of those situations, and we -- we ran, and nobody crossed the border for a long time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: How did you travel?</span> <span id="s1099">What car, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Oh, we were running, on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Just by foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: My God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1105">So that was -- that was -- that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1107">Well, so in other words, it was self defense, right.</span> <span id="s1108">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: You were defending yourself and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: So I think now is a great time to go back to your more recent past, and tell first, how did you get the opportunity or the inspiration to return to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: I was invited to meet a friend of mine in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1114">I have a friend in -- a Belgian friend who has a very large factory of making bakery equipment, ovens and so on, in South Africa.</span> <span id="s1115">And every four years, the largest baker’s convention exhibit is in Berlin, enormous.</span> <span id="s1116">And -- And I promised that we would meet there and said -- you know that close -- I was always a little hesitant to go back, I didn’t want to remember and past is past.</span> <span id="s1117">But he said, “Walter, if you want to go, I’ll lend you my car.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: How far was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Oh, from Berlin, maybe 60 miles, 70 miles, 80 miles, something like that.</span> <span id="s1120">So, I had drove up there, and unfortunately the man’s camp -- well, the woman’s camp did not exist any more and the man’s camp didn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s1121">The women’s camp, at least the -- the permanent buildings were still there.</span> <span id="s1122">The -- The prison part, where the women were.</span> <span id="s1123">The barracks were all gone, because they had typhus, everything was burned down.</span> <span id="s1124">The man’s camp was gone, there was a -- a Russian military company was there, so I couldn’t even go through.</span> <span id="s1125">So the only thing I did is went into the main building, which was the administration building of the SS, and got a couple of pamphlet or something.</span> <span id="s1126">I remember the lady told me something, I don’t remember what it was.</span> <span id="s1127">I said, “No, you’re wrong,” and I corrected her.</span> <span id="s1128">And she said, “How do you know?”</span> <span id="s1129">I said, “Well, I was here.”</span> <span id="s1130">And she looked at me.</span> <span id="s1131">“I don’t remember [indecipherable]” But anyway, that was -- that was it and I remember when I stood there and I wanted to cry and I just couldn’t, and I was like -- like a stone figure.</span> <span id="s1132">I was -- It was tough, and it was very difficult to -- to drive back.</span> <span id="s1133">But it was -- it was -- it was bad.</span> <span id="s1134">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Your thoughts upon driving back, or standing there, can you recall any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yeah, well, so many of the details came back.</span> <span id="s1137">When I saw an S man shooting somebody and when they threw a -- a head close to the wire.</span> <span id="s1138">I mean, all these -- all these reflections came, and how I worked hard and how my feet looked and my hand were blistered, and so, a mosaic of pictures arose and I was in bad shape.</span> <span id="s1139">I was in bad shape.</span> <span id="s1140">And for some reason -- I don’t know whether there’s a medical reason for it, I know when I went for the interview in Washington, I had to pause a few times.</span> <span id="s1141">I was going -- I thought I was going to break down.</span> <span id="s1142">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1143">And I want to cry, but I can’t cry.</span> <span id="s1144">I have the same sensation, but I can’t cry.</span> <span id="s1145">I have a daughter, whom I love dearly, and she suffered greatly of depression.</span> <span id="s1146">And a couple of months ago, she was house-sitting for a friend of mine, and found a gun, and put the gun in her mouth, killed herself.</span> <span id="s1147">We had a little memorial and I spoke and again, I had to pause and I thought I wouldn’t be able to make it.</span> <span id="s1148">My voice went and well, eventually -- eventually I made it, but those are the situations that I wish I could -- I would have this nice relieve and could cry for awhile, but I can’t, so, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: So you had no one to talk to there?</span> <span id="s1150">No one who had shared the experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: No.</span> <span id="s1152">No, no, I was all alone, I was -- There’s a church there, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: I’m very interested, Walter, if you have met Jewish survivors who you’ve talked with about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Oh, I have a -- I have a very, very dear friend, Dr. Samuelson.</span> <span id="s1155">He used to be chairman of the language department San Antonio and gave me a job once.</span> <span id="s1156">I taught languages for awhile.</span> <span id="s1157">We get together once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1158">He wrote a few books and he edited my book.</span> <span id="s1159">And -- And we philosophize quite a bit, we have many things in common.</span> <span id="s1160">I married a Chinese woman, he was married to a Cuban woman and after the divorce, married a Vietnamese girl who is about half his age and had three children with her.</span> <span id="s1161">A very happy man, very bright.</span> <span id="s1162">So, we philosophize, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Was he in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Oh yeah, he was in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1165">He spent quite a bit of time in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1166">He is, I think Bill is two or three years younger than I.</span> <span id="s1167">He is a Poli --</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So he was a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Yeah, he is Polish.</span> <span id="s1172">So we speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: And what do you talk about, in relation to the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: We do not speak so much about the past, we talk more about humanity.</span> <span id="s1175">You see, contrary to -- of course, every time somebody asks me, “What did you do in the war?</span> <span id="s1176">Were you in Germany in the war?”</span> <span id="s1177">I said I was i-imprisoned.</span> <span id="s1178">“Oh, so you’re Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1179">I mean, automatically, it’s assumed that I’m Jewish, and I’m not.</span> <span id="s1180">I went once to the Holocaust museum, up to the archives and I’m registered as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1181">I said, “Well, wait a minute, I’m not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1182">“Well, do you mind?”</span> <span id="s1183">“No,” I said, “I don’t give a shit one way or the other.”</span> <span id="s1184">But they have me as a Jew there.</span> <span id="s1185">The m -- The -- The -- The -- The name Meyer, could very easily be Jewish, very easily.</span> <span id="s1186">It’s an old, Roman name, I mean, it’s a Hebrew name to start with, like Golda Meir, it’s -- it’s called the enlightened one.</span> <span id="s1187">We talk more about humanity, education and even though Jews do not allow you to make comparison between persecution, systematic killing of Indians in the United States, depression and persecution and killing of Blacks, the history of the British in the world, the history of the French in the world, the history -- I mean, there’s hardly a country in the world that can say we have never done anything wrong.</span> <span id="s1188">So, the Germans were the only ones who did mass extermination in such a scientific way and it depends a little upon how you want to look at things.</span> <span id="s1189">Is this -- Is this indicative of the German scientific mind, or is this the ultimate degree of cruelty?</span> <span id="s1190">I mean, there are many ways of -- of looking at things.</span> <span id="s1191">Are Germans by nature more cruel than others?</span> <span id="s1192">No, hell no.</span> <span id="s1193">I think French are much more sadistic than Germans are, as a whole.</span> <span id="s1194">I look at the history of the Jews, ha -- how they have been prosecuted.</span> <span id="s1195">I look at the church, having done nothing whatsoever to help alleviate things.</span> <span id="s1196">So, I am more a member of the party that accuses the world, rather than pointing the fingers at one or the other.</span> <span id="s1197">And I’m pretty sure that I’d find as many sadistic Israelis as I find any -- anywhere in the world.</span> <span id="s1198">I don’t believe that I’d want to be associated with a typical Marine Sargent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Of any race?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Of any race.</span> <span id="s1201">American or whatever.</span> <span id="s1202">An American Marine Sargent is a son of a bitch from way back.</span> <span id="s1203">He’s a killer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Trained to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Trained to be, right.</span> <span id="s1206">And he’s not going to ask much.</span> <span id="s1207">If you tell him -- I mean, you know, in -- in -- in -- in Mississippi [indecipherable] deputy says, “How about killing a -- killing us a nigger this weekend?”</span> <span id="s1208">Can you understand?</span> <span id="s1209">There are people like that everywhere.</span> <span id="s1210">The Germans went a little too far, and of course, if I were a Jew, I would not allow for this to be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1211">I fully understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">But you have to go a little beyond that, and I understand.</span> <span id="s1213">I remember once I wrote a letter to Elie Wiesel, the very famous one, when he protested that Reagan was going to go to the Bittburg cemetery, where SS soldiers were interred.</span> <span id="s1214">That was -- And I tried to correct him, said, “SS were not all killers.</span> <span id="s1215">Some SS were volunteers.</span> <span id="s1216">Some were recruited into the SS.</span> <span id="s1217">They had no choice.</span> <span id="s1218">But not every SS member killed Jews, or killed anybody.</span> <span id="s1219">So I don’t know whether those in the cemetery were killers or were totally innocent bystanders.”</span> <span id="s1220">And I encouraged.</span> <span id="s1221">I wrote him, he never wrote back.</span> <span id="s1222">I said, “Why don’t you go with Mr. Reagan and hold your hand and start something new?</span> <span id="s1223">Start a peace movement.</span> <span id="s1224">Show them that you’re willing to give it a try, instead of, no we have to remember, we have to remember.”</span> <span id="s1225">You don’t do much good by doing that.</span> <span id="s1226">Certainly you remember, certainly you -- you want to prevent things from happening again.</span> <span id="s1227">Look at Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1228">We don’t talk much about Rwanda, where millions of people got killed -- slaughtered, not killed, slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1229">Because they’re Blacks, what the hell ca -- who gives a damn, right?</span> <span id="s1230">Yugoslavia’s a little closer, they’re, in quotes, civilized people.</span> <span id="s1231">I mean, up in the 20th century, people kill each other for religion in Ireland.</span> <span id="s1232">You [indecipherable] it’s -- how is it possible, huh?</span> <span id="s1233">People do weird things.</span> <span id="s1234">I never, never will understand to what extreme man can go in what he does to his fellow man.</span> <span id="s1235">That’s beyond me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Do you make any sense or can you connect the shooting in Littleton, Colorado on Hitler’s birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Oh, I think -- I think that’s a little overplayed.</span> <span id="s1238">I -- I don’t believe that Hitler has anything to do with it whatsoever, I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s1239">I look at Colorado, it does not -- I mean, it -- it’s -- it’s horrible, and to hear that one of the killer’s mother, after it happened, had her hair done in front of the school, you know, like ‘I don’t give a damn.’</span> <span id="s1240">I think that the horrible thing is in the United States, and throughout the world, is that the family, which was the strongest unit, is totally falling apart.</span> <span id="s1241">So kids grow up, no father image, single parent.</span> <span id="s1242">They grow up without anything whatsoever, and try to get attention.</span> <span id="s1243">I tried to get attention on the streets.</span> <span id="s1244">When you need attention, you need attention, whether it’s negative or positive, doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1245">So, I can understand what has happened in Colorado.</span> <span id="s1246">Do I like it?</span> <span id="s1247">Of course I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1248">And I feel sorry for the victims, of course.</span> <span id="s1249">But, it is an outcome of a ruthless, non-family life, which has -- I look at my -- my -- our nanny, who’s a lovely woman from Croatia, but she would probably pay money to see Jerry Springer.</span> <span id="s1250">Have you ever seen Jerry Springer on -- on -- on -- on -- on television?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1252">I -- I know who he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: You ought to see the program, what they see and there are millions of people standing in line to watch that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Why?</span> <span id="s1256">Because people love to see se-sensational things.</span> <span id="s1257">Like in the west, originally, they stood in line to see a hanging.</span> <span id="s1258">That’s the way the world is, we’re just terrible animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: But it’s interesting though, your family -- your first family is still close to you in Austin, around -- around the Austin area, isn’t that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: So you stayed connected -- very connected with that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1263">Don’t -- Don’t -- Don’t -- Don’t forget that I have been longer in Texas than anywhere in the world.</span> <span id="s1264">I’ve been much longer in Texas than I had been in Germany.</span> <span id="s1265">I know how to speak German, of course, but I have been here for -- for a lifetime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: What is it about Texas that -- do you think appealed to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: I love the -- the wide, open spaces.</span> <span id="s1268">People are friendly, whether that friendliness is a very profound and truism, or you never know if somebody says good day to you, does he really mean for you to have a good day, you don’t analyze that.</span> <span id="s1269">People as a whole are very friendly, eager to help.</span> <span id="s1270">I have many friends here.</span> <span id="s1271">Life is relatively easy.</span> <span id="s1272">Climate is rather pleas -- a little hot in the summer, but not that bad.</span> <span id="s1273">I have, of course, one of the choice homes in -- in -- in -- in this area, with a gorgeous view and I can go swimming any time.</span> <span id="s1274">I have a boat.</span> <span id="s1275">It’s not too far from anything.</span> <span id="s1276">You take a plane, you’re in New York in no time.</span> <span id="s1277">You go to Europe.</span> <span id="s1278">We have a new airport that will be in operate in a couple of weeks, or three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: I noticed that you have a picture of yourself with Ann Richards, could you say how you know her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: I met Ann Richards when she was county commissioner.</span> <span id="s1281">She is one of the most delightful women in the world.</span> <span id="s1282">Sharp as can be, humorous as can be.</span> <span id="s1283">Matter of fact, she wrote -- there’s Ann Richards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1285">Would you read her -- her comments about your book?</span> <span id="s1286">A: Yeah, “Walter Meyer is a remarkable, courageous man, who survived the horror of Nazi Germany and made America his home.</span> <span id="s1287">His considerable charm and talent shine through in this wonderful volume.</span> <span id="s1288">Ann Richards, former Texas governor.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Oh, that’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1290">Well, we haven’t discussed much about the book, about your -- your -- anyone who writes a book, I know, as a writer, has to be extremely motivated and I wonder what motivated you to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Over a period of years, people, knowing a little about my adventures -- and some of them are very extreme, “Why don’t you write a book, why don’t you write a book?”</span> <span id="s1292">Well, I wrote and then I said to myself, “This looks a little too much like Hollywood,” and I threw it away.</span> <span id="s1293">But you get older and older and said, “I should really write,” and then I begin more seriously, and one day I ran into a graduate student, a very fine, talented writer.</span> <span id="s1294">I said, “You want to give me a hand?”</span> <span id="s1295">And he wanted to make a little extra money.</span> <span id="s1296">So he helped me and we then became very disciplined.</span> <span id="s1297">And it was to be published by the Holocaust Museum, and it had to go through three editors there, and they all okayed it.</span> <span id="s1298">And then it went through to -- two independent sources in Germany and they had to decide whether the book was a contribution to the -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: And so the Holocaust Museum decided not to publish it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Based on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Based upon the fact that two independent sources in Germany had decided that the book did not represent a new contribution to the history of concentration camps, and so on.</span> <span id="s1303">So then I had a -- a list -- I think Mr. Gelb from -- he’s one of the editors there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: At the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Michael Gelb, yeah, gave me a list, and I wrote to one and two and it’s not only difficult to write a book, but it’s very difficult to find a publisher, I can tell you that.</span> <span id="s1306">And -- But I had a list and there was an 800 number for the University of Missouri Press.</span> <span id="s1307">I called the 800 number and said, “This is Dr. Meyer, may I speak to the director?”</span> <span id="s1308">Well, I assume that she thought maybe there was an accident or something, a doctor needs to go through, so I talked to the director, I said, well -- I had written a query letter and I said, “May I read the query letter to you over the phone?”</span> <span id="s1309">Said, “Yeah, please.”</span> <span id="s1310">We kind of liked each other over the phone.</span> <span id="s1311">And after I finished the query letter, she said, “I want to see the manuscript.”</span> <span id="s1312">So I send the manuscript and two months later she called and said, “Well, it’s always so difficult for me to tell people that, unfortunately we have to turn down their,” blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1313">I said, “Here it comes.”</span> <span id="s1314">“But in your case, it has to be published.”</span> <span id="s1315">So, University of Missouri Press said leave everything as it is, and so this was it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: They didn’t ask for any changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: No, no changes whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1318">There’s a picture here, at least there -- yeah, there is one.</span> <span id="s1319">I should find it.</span> <span id="s1320">So this came out just a few weeks ago, and I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Just a couple of weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Oh, congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Yeah, well, thank you, and it seems to be doing rather well.</span> <span id="s1325">And, so that’s -- there I am when I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Oh, and what does the uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: It’s the Navy, because I was -- I was in the Hitler youth and the Hitler youth was divided and -- this is Lovey.</span> <span id="s1328">Remember when I told you about Lovey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: That’s when I was a sailor on the Parkhaven, shoveled coal, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: And he was from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: He was from Curaςao.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Curaςao.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: From the Dutch West Indies.</span> <span id="s1335">So that’s the book that just came out and I have been asked to do a little tour for Barnes and Noble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Will you be coming to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: God knows, maybe yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Yeah, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: You’ll have some tough audiences there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: That’s where the tough audiences are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Ph.D.’s will really help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Well, I have a few questions from Arwin Donohue for you, so -- follow-up on your life, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Unless you wanted to add something about the book, or thoughts that you’ve had.</span> <span id="s1349">I know that finishing a book is sort of like, I’ve been told, having a baby.</span> <span id="s1350">You know, afterwards, there are all sorts of -- well, there may be depressions and then there may be joyful experiences, or connections with other people.</span> <span id="s1351">Were you reconnected, so far, with anyone from your past in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Do you expect that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: No, I have contact to my cousin here, to another cousin, who’s coming to visit me with his wife.</span> <span id="s1355">But others, don’t forget, I’m going to be 73 years old.</span> <span id="s1356">Most of the people are dead.</span> <span id="s1357">So there are not too many people round there.</span> <span id="s1358">I have one friend who is close to death now.</span> <span id="s1359">He is a year younger than I and we used to have this Jewish boy hiding in our basement.</span> <span id="s1360">We never understood why they were against him.</span> <span id="s1361">We were talking about that last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s1362">But he is pretty much in bad shape, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: It’s Eddie Wylant.</span> <span id="s1365">He carries a little bag with him, you know, his kidney don’t function well, God knows.</span> <span id="s1366">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: I wanted to ask you now that we’re on the physical, cause I know you were wa -- you had TB and you were beaten and you discuss in the ’96 interview, pain in your legs.</span> <span id="s1368">Have you had physical problems that result -- that come back, from that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: The only thing that is evident is that as a consequence of malnutrition, nerves in my legs have suffered greatly.</span> <span id="s1370">And so, I cannot stand for a long time, then I begin to dance around and try to find -- especially on concrete floors, okay?</span> <span id="s1371">But, other than that, I’m -- I mean, I had back surgeries, but I cannot stand here and look you straight in the eyes and say the surgeries can be attributed to my being imprisoned.</span> <span id="s1372">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: What about your experience, not just being in prison, but in watching -- in getting sort of a close up, but outsider’s view of -- of what happened in the Holocaust to Jewish people, is there anything beyond the physical that you think had informed you, that informs your decisions, as to where to go and what to do and what your interests are, from that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Well, my interests right now have to be, I have given the children I have -- the children I have left, about as liberal education as possible and I have never allowed any form of segregation to exist in my family.</span> <span id="s1375">And the daughter I have now will grow up to be as liberal, as objective, as understanding as possible.</span> <span id="s1376">Of course, I have no voc -- no -- no control over whether she going to -- going to end up at the age of 25 with drugs or something like that.</span> <span id="s1377">I-I hope not.</span> <span id="s1378">Other than that, I look left and right and unfortunately, whenever you see something like the Holocaust, you -- you -- you would think that something like that can never happen again and I wish I could believe that, but I can’t.</span> <span id="s1379">So, atrocities in the world are not a dampener, or not a way to tell people, “Let’s go into mass education and prevent this from happening again.”</span> <span id="s1380">No, no, there are many, many prisoners or leaders who said, “Let’s keep people as stupid as possible, because it’s so much easier to govern them.</span> <span id="s1381">Let’s create some sort of sickening nationalism and let’s teach them that the Albanians, or the Jews, they are no good, they are responsible for your bleeding, they are responsible for your bad economy, they are the ones.”</span> <span id="s1382">I see it again and again and again.</span> <span id="s1383">So, humanity has not changed and will not change, unless there is some -- some kind of enlightenment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: In considering the small daughter of yours, who I saw, and her generation, what would be your greatest hopes that she may be?</span> <span id="s1385">I mean, I know the greatest fear might be drugs, but the greatest hopes that she might take away with, say when she reads her father’s book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: That she will become compassionate, understanding.</span> <span id="s1387">That she will ask a thousand questions why, why, why, instead of accepting blindly.</span> <span id="s1388">That she will learn about other cultures and grow up to be the kind of person that you must love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: But, I wanted to ask you some of the follow up questions from Arwin and one of them is your -- your birthdate, and your father’s and brother’s full names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: My birth date is 31st of May, 1926.</span> <span id="s1391">My brother’s full name was Paul Meyer.</span> <span id="s1392">My father’s name was Paul Meyer.</span> <span id="s1393">My mother’s name was Henriette Meyer, and her maiden name was Sommerhauser, S-o-m-m-e-r-h-a-u-s-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: This is an interesting question, I think, that you mentioned that, in your ’96 interview, that during the time you were in Ravensbrück, which I’m only pronouncing this as an American child, in the quarry, there was a hierarchy of nationalities among prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: At what rung of this hierarch-archy were you and other German pris-prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: At the highest level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: The highest level?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: You were privileged at all, because of your nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: No, that was not privileged.</span> <span id="s1402">It just happened to be divided like that.</span> <span id="s1403">It had nothing to do with -- wi-with -- with a privilege.</span> <span id="s1404">I mean, we were -- we were picking rocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: So that was not -- that was not the -- the highest level was just as bad as the lowest level, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Were there any Jews in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: So, was there mixing between ethnic or national groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: There was -- There were -- There were quite a few Russians, Poles.</span> <span id="s1411">When I say there were no Jews, that I know, okay?</span> <span id="s1412">There were some, I understand, some French prisoners of war were there, and maybe a few Czechs, and so and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: I really like this next question, it’s, listening to you talk about your experiences during the war, Arwin is struck by what seems to her to be a very optimistic attitude.</span> <span id="s1414">Is that an accurate assessment?</span> <span id="s1415">Did you feel optimistic at all at that time, or did it come back later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Well, Miss Donohue, I have been asked that question many times, and there seems to be evidence that I am optimistic, but I want to make a correction.</span> <span id="s1417">My optimism is not -- is an innate thing.</span> <span id="s1418">In other words, I do things not because I’m optimistic, but because I do not think that the consequences may be devastating.</span> <span id="s1419">You understand?</span> <span id="s1420">People prepare themselve and say, “If I do this, if I get caught, oh my God, what am I going to do?”</span> <span id="s1421">I let things happen and then I think, “What am I going to do now?”</span> <span id="s1422">So, I don’t know whether optimist is -- is -- is an accurate word to describe me.</span> <span id="s1423">I think I am rather -- I would rather use the word irresponsible, because in my past, I have been too -- playing with fire too much, and that is an irresponsible act.</span> <span id="s1424">Oh, I’m going to get away with it, ah, nobody’s going to catch me, or nobody’s going to see me and I have no fear.</span> <span id="s1425">But there’s a difference between having fear as a consequence of intelligent thinking, or having no fear because I just don’t give a damn.</span> <span id="s1426">I’m -- I’m -- I’m -- So, I’m an adventurer really, I’m a Gypsy by -- by -- by sheer and weird conglomeration of genes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: And speaking of genes, did you say something about no Jewish blood for five generations?</span> <span id="s1428">Does that indicate --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: I had to prove that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: How did you prove that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Well, you had to prove that in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Oh, so you don’t know what happened before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Before five gener -- hell, no, I could have a lot of Jewish blood, but no.</span> <span id="s1434">You had to prove that for five generations, you were Aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Had to prove to whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: To the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: When did they ask?</span> <span id="s1438">Did they ask your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Well, when you -- when you -- for example, were you a member of the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s1440">And in Germany, you see people in Germany like -- like in other European countries, they were born here and they died here, so it’s -- it’s -- it’s very -- it’s not like America, say, “Where did your grandfather come from?”</span> <span id="s1441">“I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1442">In Germany, you know where your grandfather, your great-grandfather, where they all came from, see?</span> <span id="s1443">My cousin lives in the house in which my father was born and that existed in 1590.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Your cousin that’s visiting here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: This cousin here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1447">Well, that’s the sense of -- Is he a similar age to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: No, she is much younger --</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: She.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: -- than.</span> <span id="s1451">She is 56.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1453">You didn’t know her then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Oh yeah, I’ve known her forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: I knew her as a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: That must have a -- a very -- a feeling of closure, doesn’t it, to have a relative from that time, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Yeah, she is very close to me, she is a good woman and she lost her husband with cancer and her son was involved in a head-on collision, so he was in coma for three -- three months.</span> <span id="s1459">And she is a fine, fine, fine woman.</span> <span id="s1460">Good woman and my parents loved her to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: When did your parents -- I know you told me about the death of your father, but you didn’t -- When was the last time you saw your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: I saw my -- my father maybe six months before he died.</span> <span id="s1463">I went to Germany rather frequently.</span> <span id="s1464">And my mother died in 80 ti -- no, my mother died in ’79.</span> <span id="s1465">And I saw her in the last weeks of her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Here’s an interesting observation by Arwin, on relationships with your parents after the war, particularly your relationship with your father, whom you seem to have seen in the early days as the chief force against which you rebelled.</span> <span id="s1467">You actually mention now that, or that in ’96 interview, that you are exactly like your father.</span> <span id="s1468">What do you mean by this?</span> <span id="s1469">Is this possibly a tie-in with his feeling -- your feelings about authority in general, after the war and today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: W-Well, my father thought that beating me up would conform me.</span> <span id="s1471">If he had a been somewhat of a psychologist, he would have said, with a little sugar and a little candy, Walter is going to be a fantastic human being.</span> <span id="s1472">But he beat me up until I was blue and red, a-and at the age of 12, if you had given me a gun, I would have shot him.</span> <span id="s1473">When he saw me after the war, from then on he tried so hard to undo and redo and he was the most unselfish man I ever met.</span> <span id="s1474">And he tried to give me his right arm and his left arm, until one day I told him, “You cannot buy my love.</span> <span id="s1475">Just forget all the bullshit.</span> <span id="s1476">I -- I -- Let me try to forget.”</span> <span id="s1477">And I came to love him, and I miss him.</span> <span id="s1478">I wish he would show up some bi -- weekend.</span> <span id="s1479">Death is a kind of miserable thing, anyway.</span> <span id="s1480">So, when I say I am very much the way he was in many ways, I’m a rather unselfish person.</span> <span id="s1481">I never buy things for me.</span> <span id="s1482">It’s my wife who buys a new shirt or something, I don’t go.</span> <span id="s1483">I don’t particularly care how I look.</span> <span id="s1484">I don’t particularly care what I eat.</span> <span id="s1485">I don’t need any luxury whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1486">I don’t need a new car, as long as the one I have runs.</span> <span id="s1487">So, in that respect, I’m much happier with -- with beans, than I am with -- with -- what do the Russians have, the fish eggs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Caviar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: With caviar, yeah, you know?</span> <span id="s1490">So, my stape is -- my taste is simple.</span> <span id="s1491">So, I am as impatient as he was.</span> <span id="s1492">I’m a little -- I tend to be violent, as -- as he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: In -- In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Violent especially by, if I see a uniform, uniforms have a tremendously bad impact on me and when they -- well, you know, not too many years ago, I had a problem with a policeman and I broke his -- his -- his -- his nose.</span> <span id="s1495">You don’t do that, you ought to control yourself.</span> <span id="s1496">It’s difficult for me to control myself.</span> <span id="s1497">It gets better as I get older, okay?</span> <span id="s1498">So, I have many of my father’s traits, but I’ve also let -- like my mother, I have all the artistic blood from my mother and so on, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: You said that she was writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: She wrote beautifully and she wrote poetry and she was oh, she lived in a -- in a -- in a world of art, in a world that doesn’t exist.</span> <span id="s1501">She was a dreamer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: Where did you have a chance to read her writing?</span> <span id="s1503">A: Well, she wrote a bunch of things that I have.</span> <span id="s1504">How she met her husband.</span> <span id="s1505">Everything is written in -- Oh, she had a beautiful choice of words, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Journal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: In German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: In German, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Do you think that your -- your ability to paint came from her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: I -- I have to assume so, because there were a few painters in my family and sculptors on her side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: There are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Yeah, not on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s1514">My father’s side are all farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: That came in handy in your many jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Both farming and painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1519">This, by the way, is a painting I did of my father.</span> <span id="s1520">That’s my father there on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: That’s a beautiful painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s1523">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Are you still painting now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1526">I did a painting not too long ago that was shipped to Germany, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: That’s a very -- a very major gift, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Thank you, thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: And I want to see what else we’ve gotten to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Okay, hold it for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1532">Now, who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Lady Bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1535">And this is your painting that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: That’s the painting in the back, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: That she has, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1538">“To Walter Meyer, with so many thanks, Lady Bird Johnson.”</span> <span id="s1539">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Oh, maybe a year ago, something like that.</span> <span id="s1541">There is Lady Bird up there.</span> <span id="s1542">And there is the president with his family, and there’s the president with his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: And the pope, is that the pope up there?</span> <span id="s1544">That’s the cardinal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: No, that’s Cardinal Spellman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: But you haven’t continued your cut -- your connection with Catholicism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Oh no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1548">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s1549">I’m not -- I am not a -- I am not a church-going man.</span> <span id="s1550">Matter of fact, I have many problems with the church.</span> <span id="s1551">So that’s Ann Richards, “To my friend Walter Meyer.”</span> <span id="s1552">Let’s see, who else is there that you might be interested in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Clark Gable would be mine -- my -- my first choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Clark Gable [indecipherable], yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1555">Well, there’s Bo Derek up there, see I’m in the picture above my father there, I’m with Bo Derek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Those are pictures where I’m on horseback.</span> <span id="s1558">You see up there?</span> <span id="s1559">Those are all horse pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: From the movies, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Yeah, they are partly.</span> <span id="s1562">And this one here is when Governor Connelly, after he was shot -- I was asked to go to Germany to promote tourism to Texas.</span> <span id="s1563">And I went with Senator Richter and this is when we came back, he was shot, so this was in ’63, ’64.</span> <span id="s1564">Yeah, ’63.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: I don’t know if I should just ask what does your wife do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: She is a computer engineer.</span> <span id="s1567">She works for Dell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: So, you’ve given so much, I think -- a question which I think is interesting is, going back -- you mentioned going back to your father’s -- your mother’s -- your -- the hometown where you grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: And I’m wondering if you ever met, earlier -- on your earlier trips, did you meet any of the townspeople that you had known then and did you discuss -- did they know what had happened to you, or did they know what had happened in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Well, you have to understand that there are people that certainly they knew about me, and there are people, or there was one in -- man in particular who threatened to denounce my father for having listened to the BBC.</span> <span id="s1572">When I came back, I was told, “Do you remember so and so?”</span> <span id="s1573">Well, my attitude was then, “Oh, let’s forget him.”</span> <span id="s1574">As a matter of fact, my father is the one who encouraged me to ask for rehabilitation from the German government.</span> <span id="s1575">Reparation money.</span> <span id="s1576">I said, “Oh, they can’t buy my health back and so on.”</span> <span id="s1577">Finally, when I came to Germany, he insisted that we go to an attorney who was trying to reinstate me because I had missed the deadline.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: What year would this have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: I don’t remember, in the 50’s, I assume.</span> <span id="s1580">Anyway, the Germans rejected me, because in Germany, if you miss the deadline, you miss the deadline.</span> <span id="s1581">And we brought forward that I was in the jungle of Peru and I had no idea that there was a deadline.</span> <span id="s1582">No, no way.</span> <span id="s1583">And so I said, “I’m going to try it myself, just to see how the Germans handle this.”</span> <span id="s1584">And I wrote to, and had quite a correspondence with a member of parliament, a member of the bunderstock, who was head of the judiciary, I think.</span> <span id="s1585">And he made it very clear, “Sorry, Walter, you missed the deadline.”</span> <span id="s1586">So, in Germany, you miss the deadline, in America there are exceptions to the rule, in Germany there are not.</span> <span id="s1587">So, I forgot all about it and the people -- the people, some of them died, some of them I didn’t want to have any association with whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1588">And, you know, Germans tried very hard to claim that, “Oh no, we were never Nazis, we were always against it,” and so on.</span> <span id="s1589">But that’s what you have to expect.</span> <span id="s1590">Nobody’s going to say, “Yes, I’m guilty.”</span> <span id="s1591">People don’t do that.</span> <span id="s1592">So, you know.</span> <span id="s1593">Anyway -- So, I have not -- I know people who benefitted greatly during the Hitler regime, and do I want to make a big issue, do I want to?</span> <span id="s1594">No, I -- You have to know that whatever you do has some kind of positive result.</span> <span id="s1595">If not, why touch it?</span> <span id="s1596">It doesn’t do any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Well, thank you so much.</span> <span id="s1598">Is there anything else you want to add?</span> <span id="s1599">I -- I’m sure there are many things, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1601">You tell Miss Donohue, if she has any questions, to write them down and send them to me and I will answer them to the best of my ability.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1603">This concludes the interview with Walter Meyer, conducted by Ginger Miles, in Austin, Texas, April, 1999.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">End of Tape Three, Side
