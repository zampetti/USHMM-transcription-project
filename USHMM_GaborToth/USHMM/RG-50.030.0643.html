Hahn.</span> <span id="s40">And all their initials were L.A. And it later became a public – publicly traded bank which was called Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s43">And, in fact, the house is still standing and it’s a historic – has a historic designation of the bank, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So the ba – the bank’s building and facility?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, the bank’s building.</span> <span id="s46">It’s really just the outside, because the rest was destroyed during the war, but the outside is still standing.</span> <span id="s47">So anyway, they had a bank.</span> <span id="s48">And of course you may know that in Frankfurt there were lots of mixed marriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Well, I wanted to ask you about that, you know, how was it that your parents even met?</span> <span id="s50">What brought the – brought their worlds together?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I really just don’t know, but – but my father was – my grandparents ha – on my father’s side had three boys, and my father was the youngest.</span> <span id="s52">Clearly the apple of my grandmother’s eye.</span> <span id="s53">And he is the only one who went to university, and he had a law – he got a law degree.</span> <span id="s54">And I think he was very society minded.</span> <span id="s55">And he – I – I’ll show you later upstairs, I have a – an old program from something at the [indecipherable] opera, where he danced with some lady.</span> <span id="s56">And I have a feeling that that’s how they met, because he was really very interested in getting up there somehow.</span> <span id="s57">He was also a champion tennis player.</span> <span id="s58">He was German master in 1910, which was a different tennis game from what it is now, but nevertheless.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: It’s still something, it’s an achievement, you know, in competition with others in your area.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yes, yeah, I – I have all the trophies upstairs.</span> <span id="s61">And he also played the piano very well, and he used to accompany singers or play in small trios.</span> <span id="s62">So I’m – I am sure that’s how they met somehow, in – in a dance, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What kind of personality did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: My fa –</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: How would you – mm-hm, how would you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: My father should have been a diplomat.</span> <span id="s67">He was one of the most tactful people I’ve ever known, and really was charming.</span> <span id="s68">I mean, everybody just loved him.</span> <span id="s69">And he – he just – he ended up being a banker, because he finally took over my grandparents bank.</span> <span id="s70">But he – he should have been a diplomat.</span> <span id="s71">He – he was not very strict, but you know, I – I grew up at a time that my parents weren’t home that much, and I had a – a wonderful – I don’t know, now you call it nanny, I guess, but it wa – she was just a young woman whom they hired, and who took care of the kids, and did other stuff, too.</span> <span id="s72">And she is really the one who – who raised me, more or less.</span> <span id="s73">Not that I didn’t see my parents, I mean, I saw them quite a bit, but – we always had meals together.</span> <span id="s74">We always ate – we used to get the – and you know, in Europe yo-you eat your main meal at noon, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: And so we always had that together, but I don’t – in the evening they were often gone.</span> <span id="s77">But, you know, he was a very nice person.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Now, were you the oldest child?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No.</span> <span id="s80">My sister was two years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: And what’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Her name was Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Ruth.</span> <span id="s84">And you then were born in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Ah, no, Ruth – what year were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: I was born in 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: 1920.</span> <span id="s89">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: And she was born 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: 1918.</span> <span id="s92">And what I had forgotten to ask earlier, your mother’s maiden name, and her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: My mother’s name was Marguerata(ph) Helena Hahn, h-a-h-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Okay, Marguerata(ph) Helena.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: But she was called Margar(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: And so then they – you know, my father, I remember, he is – at the time I had allergic eczema, which of course, when I was a child they didn’t know it was allergy.</span> <span id="s98">And I remember my father always at night bandaging my arms, so that I wouldn’t scratch, you know.</span> <span id="s99">But you know, I don’t really know if it was so often.</span> <span id="s100">It just – your memory just plays tricks on you.</span> <span id="s101">Anyway, it was – it was very nice.</span> <span id="s102">I grew up – well, my family, I guess they had a lot of money, but I didn’t really know that, you know?</span> <span id="s103">I – it never occurred to me that I lived different from a lot of other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Well, what do you remember about your home; both as a physical structure, and about the kind of life that you and your f – your parents and your sister; and whoever else was there, the – the young girl who was part of your household; what was that like?</span> <span id="s105">So let’s talk about all of it.</span> <span id="s106">Describe it a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well, we lived – and later when we’ve finished I’ll show you the pictures, because I have pict – pictures on the wall of – of my – I grew up in what used to be my grandparents dairy farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: That is your father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s110">And it was a regular farm in a U-shape, with the main house on one side, and then what used to be the barns in a U-shape around it.</span> <span id="s111">In the middle was a – a well.</span> <span id="s112">And of course we didn’t have any animals any more – I mean, we had dogs, but – and chickens, but not the cows and stuff.</span> <span id="s113">So we used the barns mainly for garages.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: For what?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: For garage.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: And also for our bicycles and – and tools and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Did it still look like a farm, or did it look like a villa in the outskirts of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No, it looked like a farm.</span> <span id="s120">And it [indecipherable] three acres.</span> <span id="s121">And it actually, when I grew up, was no longer on the outskirts of – of town, it was in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: I see, in Frankfurt itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s124">So it – you know, the streetcar was a half a block away.</span> <span id="s125">So it – then I took the streetcar to go to wo – to go to school.</span> <span id="s126">So it – it was really in the middle of town.</span> <span id="s127">And the one thing I really regret, it – it has been razed now, and I regret that because if historic preservation had come into life sooner, that thing would have stayed, because it’s very unusual to have a farm in the middle of –</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: – of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: But, you know, in any ca – in any case, where – the main house, when you faced it, sat on the left, and it was really very beautiful.</span> <span id="s132">It was big house, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: How would you describe its style, its architectural style?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: How would you describe its architectural style?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well, it was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Twenty – turn of the century.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: A stucco house.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: And it had a – a gate in the front, which usually was open because we had cars, but you could close the gate, and then it had a driveway, long driveway, which led you into the courtyard.</span> <span id="s143">And next door was a boys’ school, which was kind of nice when I grew up.</span> <span id="s144">But it was really just beautiful, and we had a large, just garden for – to enjoy, and then we had a lot of vegetables, and we had chickens.</span> <span id="s145">A-And – and we did have a lot of help.</span> <span id="s146">I-I think we probably had three maids, and – and there was, from the – across the courtyard from the main house, there was th – at the end of the last barn there was another little house, and the – I don’t know what the guy’s name, it was sort of a – like a – a super in an apartment building.</span> <span id="s147">He and his wife lived there, and you know, he would tend the furnace, and do stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So the ka – kind of housekeepers.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s150">And – and then we had a gardener who lived in the same place upstairs, and I – I think we had three maids and a cook, but I can’t – yeah, I think we had three maids and a cook.</span> <span id="s151">So I sometimes wonder what my mother did all day, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Well, tell me a little bit about her.</span> <span id="s153">If I asked you about what your father’s personality was like, what was hers like?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: My mother enjoyed ill health.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Oh gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, she – she was – I’m sure she had some ill health, but if she – if she did, I know, had a stomach operation early in her marriage.</span> <span id="s157">I have a feeling it all – it had to do with nerves too, you know?</span> <span id="s158">And then she, in 1929 she had a major operation, I – I don’t know if it was a hysterectomy, or something like that.</span> <span id="s159">And what is very unfortunate, she had a surgeon who was addicted to morphine, and he got her addicted.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And she was addicted the rest of her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Oh dear, what a tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: And that was very unfortunate, because she was really a very wonderful person.</span> <span id="s164">But of course, I was only nine when this started, so I never really knew what a wonderful person she was.</span> <span id="s165">I knew it mainly through other people, who told me about it.</span> <span id="s166">She was, you know, she had – of course had not gone to college, but she was pretty smart, and she had a lot of common sense.</span> <span id="s167">And she was very – she had a lot of empathy.</span> <span id="s168">And I’ll tell you a little story, during the depression, you know, in – starting in 1930, I guess, when there was so much poverty in Germany, she started a soup kitchen at our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: And it’s one of my most vivid memories.</span> <span id="s171">We – the kitchen door was on the side, and the kitchen door had – had sort of a window you could raise up to the outside.</span> <span id="s172">And we would have, every day, about 20 people who came.</span> <span id="s173">After a while, we started giving out little slips to people, to say which day they could come, and – with their name.</span> <span id="s174">And I know I used to write those slips, which is why I remember it so well.</span> <span id="s175">And then they would come starting at noon, and our cook would have a big soup, you know, something substantial, and bread.</span> <span id="s176">And we had benches in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s177">And if it was raining, we put them in the – one of the barns.</span> <span id="s178">And then the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main meal, I guess.</span> <span id="s179">In fact, we had one couple that found each other and got married.</span> <span id="s180">And then on Christmas, she always had everybody come, and she – they got – the men got shaving cream and stuff like that, and the women got some other stuff.</span> <span id="s181">He – they – they all got the little bag with goodies.</span> <span id="s182">So she really, I mean, and that was entirely my mother’s make – doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: That’s a very kind thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: And she really, I mean, that’s the kind of person she was.</span> <span id="s185">But, of course, the addiction was dreadful, because you know, a-an addiction to morphine is the same as – as a heroin addiction, or any other.</span> <span id="s186">It’s unpredictable.</span> <span id="s187">The mood can be – one day you think, oh, she’s wonderful, and then you talk a lot, and then the next day she’s gone again, you know.</span> <span id="s188">And – and she did go into rehab twice in Germany, and then it was better for a while, but it never lasted.</span> <span id="s189">And then when she came to this country – you know, I don’t know where she got her morphine.</span> <span id="s190">That’s sometimes the curse of having money.</span> <span id="s191">And – but a – it was the same in – in Tucson, where she lived, I mean, she – and in the end, it wa – was just awful.</span> <span id="s192">But you know, tha-that is – that was very sad, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s194">And hard for children.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: But, you know, it – the one thing I – I – I have told this to my kids from the day they were born, in order to make sure that they stayed away from all drugs, because I told them how horrible this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Well, the price that people pay.</span> <span id="s197">The price that the family pays, the price that the person pays.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: It – it’s – it’s – it’s really very sad.</span> <span id="s199">But, you know – and – and I know – I mean, we all know it was – it was her surgeon who got her addicted, and he was addicted him – a lot of doctors are addicted, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Well, before that happened, you would have been nine years or less, but you mention that your parents would go out in the evenings.</span> <span id="s201">Did they – did they enjoy each other’s company?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s203">And – and, as I think I want to – I mean, they got divorced in ’38.</span> <span id="s204">I think it had na – it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my mother was Jewish, and my father wasn’t.</span> <span id="s205">My sister and I saw that divorce coming for years.</span> <span id="s206">Which doesn’t mean they weren’t friendly.</span> <span id="s207">They were very friendly, they always talked to each other and – and – but, you know, I – it’s very hard to look at your parents and think about sex.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: But I think it was very – they were incompatible.</span> <span id="s210">That’s what I think, you know, and I think that my father wasn’t that interested in it, and my mother was more interested in it, and do I think that was the basis for the divorce.</span> <span id="s211">Because she got married again, but – to the guy that she’d been going with for years, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Did you all know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s214">Kids always know everything.</span> <span id="s215">Kids know everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: You know, you just – you think your kids don’t know?</span> <span id="s218">Kids always know.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, we – we both knew – my sister and I both knew it.</span> <span id="s221">But – and – but you know, that’s the way it was, and I know my father knew it.</span> <span id="s222">But you know, tha – it didn’t seem – that’s why I think that that was the basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: And they were – when my mother died, six months before my father, and the one who grieved the most was my father.</span> <span id="s225">So, you know, they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: There was a bond.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yeah, that wa – they were just always – and he came over here and visited with her and her husband, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: This is after the war, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: And – and during – and after the war she went back to Germany once and stayed with my father, you know, so – I mean, they were very good friends, they really liked each other.</span> <span id="s232">It’s just, I think in bed they didn’t mesh.</span> <span id="s233">So, you know, I mean, yeah, you don’t think about that when you’re a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Did you – as you were growing up, were you upset by these things, were you hurt by these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: No, we just knew that it was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: You know, and – and that this guy, I mean, I could never stand her second husband, but – and I think partly, perhaps because I felt he interfered, but I’m not sure I just didn’t like him anyway.</span> <span id="s238">But, no, he – he – he was a friend of the family and he – they traveled together, all of them, and you know, it – it was – was just one of those –</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Your grandparents on both sides, the in-laws, the larger, extended family, did they like each other?</span> <span id="s240">Did they get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: When my – I – my father’s parents were dead when I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: So I don’t know anything about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What about your uncles, his brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: His brothers, they were odd.</span> <span id="s246">Neither one of them got married.</span> <span id="s247">His older brother, the oldest one I think was gay.</span> <span id="s248">I’m pretty sure he was gay.</span> <span id="s249">In fact, I’m sure he was gay.</span> <span id="s250">And he lived not very far from where we lived, and he had a little – sort of a – in Germany you know you – you sometimes have these little yards, that you can bring – where there are little houses that you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s251">Well, he had one of those little houses on our property, which of course was where he grew up, and he would come and – and – in the summer with his friends, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s252">But – and his other brother I really never knew.</span> <span id="s253">He died in 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s255">Yeah, so, you to –</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: And so I – I never knew him.</span> <span id="s257">But the fa – th-the older one, I knew quite well.</span> <span id="s258">He died in ’31, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: But we – Heinrich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Heinrich(ph), mm-hm.</span> <span id="s262">Uncle Heinrich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: And the other one’s name was George.</span> <span id="s264">But neither one of them ever mar – well, the one was gay, I mean, I’m sure he was gay.</span> <span id="s265">He lived with his friend in an apartment not very far.</span> <span id="s266">And my grandparents on my mother’s side, adored my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Well, I was thinking that, because a bank is a huge business.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s269">They adored my father and – and in fact, when my grandmother died – she lived to be 89 – I can’t remember exactly the date.</span> <span id="s270">That – that’s my family tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: And I can take it off, and you can look at it.</span> <span id="s273">When she died, she left my father money.</span> <span id="s274">And she left a letter saying he had always been wonderful, and – and all this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s275">No, she – they were very fond of my father.</span> <span id="s276">They also didn’t much like my mother’s second husband, which is interesting because my mother’s second husband was a Jew.</span> <span id="s277">But they didn’t like him much either.</span> <span id="s278">But – and okay, so th-they – and we saw my grandparents, my mother’s parents, a lot un – 19 – until 1933.</span> <span id="s279">They had a summer house in Königstein, which is –</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: – nowadays it – it’s almost a suburb of Frankfurt now because people live there and commute in.</span> <span id="s282">But at the time you – you took either a car, or a train, and it took about an hour to get there, I mean, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: And we would spend s-summer vacation sometimes and always fall vacations there with my grandparents and with my mother’s sister and her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Did your mother have only one sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: My mother had two sisters.</span> <span id="s287">One was older.</span> <span id="s288">Sh-She is the one who – who made those two charcoal drawings of my grandparents, the grandfather and great-grandfather.</span> <span id="s289">She was quite talented that way, but she was really a bitch on wheels.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Oh dear me, really?</span> <span id="s291">A: Yeah, she was, and she collected people, important people.</span> <span id="s292">That was her aim in life, she collected important people.</span> <span id="s293">And she was also a manipulator.</span> <span id="s294">But, you know, sh-she did have talent, I mean, those pictures are very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: They’re very well done.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: And I have a little picture of myself upstairs, when I was a child, that she did.</span> <span id="s297">She was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Was she nice to you, as her nieces, or not very?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yeah, she was fine.</span> <span id="s300">I mean, you know, she was just – we saw them a bit – those two women didn’t get – I mean, they didn’t have much in common.</span> <span id="s301">And then she had a younger sister, whom I never knew, because she died, I think, in 1922.</span> <span id="s302">She must have been very smart.</span> <span id="s303">And she was – of the three girls, she went to the university.</span> <span id="s304">And she wrote poems.</span> <span id="s305">She also was a – I don’t know, she was a very good Jew; the only one in that family.</span> <span id="s306">But she, and some of the po – my grandmother had the poems printed after she died.</span> <span id="s307">And I don’t know if I – I know I gave Steven one of the copies.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Steven is your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s311">Just to make that clear in the interview, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: And she died, she must have been 21, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Her name was Lucy.</span> <span id="s315">She was called Luchs(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Luchs(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: And she was my godmother, and I don’t know for sure what she died of.</span> <span id="s318">They said it was typhus, but I’m – I’m not really sure, you know, in 1921, you can’t be sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I know sh – that she was in the hospital, she was supposed to go somewhere for the summer, and she got terrible intestinal problems and – and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And your other aunt, the one who was – I won’t use that expression, but I love it – the one who collected people.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: What was her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Nora.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Nora, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: She was older than your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes, she was a – my mother was a middle child –</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: – which was always hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: But – and I think some of the problem stemmed from the fact that she was the middle child, because the youngest one, who was 10 years younger than my mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Ah yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: – was obviously my grandmother’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Favorite, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s337">And – and the older one was a manipulator and knew what to get, and my mother was just in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And I’m sure that that was part of her problems.</span> <span id="s340">But, in any ca – my aunt had two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s341">The boy was called Erish(ph), and the girl was Anina(ph), like Steven’s youngest daughter.</span> <span id="s342">And the boy died when he was 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: They always said he died of appendicitis, but actually he died of syphilis, because he didn’t take care of it, and then got sepsis.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Ay-ay.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: But, you know, that you couldn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: One doesn’t say those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: You couldn’t say that, so it was appendicitis, but we all knew what he died of.</span> <span id="s349">And he had been my aunt’s favorite, and my cousin often stayed with us, the bo – the girl, because my ca – aunt didn’t much care for her.</span> <span id="s350">But after the boy died, of course –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: She’s the only one left.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: She was the only one left, and then so – but I was on very good terms with my cousin who died probably five years ago in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: This – this is his sister, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Yeah, the – the sisters – my mother’s sister’s daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s356">And her name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Her name was Anina(ph) von Malk(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Ah, yeah [indecipherable] yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: As a married.</span> <span id="s360">She was – you know, there – there’s some people in my family you should have interviewed rather than me, because my cousin Anina(ph) married a man called von Malk(ph), who was also a Jew, and my – I will say my aunt arranged that marriage.</span> <span id="s361">And they – he was working in what was then Palestine, in Haifa –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: – for a British company.</span> <span id="s364">And then they came to England and lived in London, and then when – during the war, when everybody got worried about being occupied by Germany, they took a boat, which they thought would take them to Mexico or to the United States; however, it only took them to Antigua.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: What was the name of the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What was the name of the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s369">It wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Because there was that famous –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: – it wasn’t the Saint Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: – Saint Louis, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, it wasn’t the Saint Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: But in any case, they got to Antigua, where they spent the rest of the war, about five years.</span> <span id="s376">And then they went to Mexico City, and her husband was a – a amateur chef, however they – they opened a restaurant in Mexico City.</span> <span id="s377">First they did some catering, and then they opened a restaurant.</span> <span id="s378">And they did very well, I think.</span> <span id="s379">And then they went back to Switzerland and got a divorce, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: That’s a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: But that’s a different story.</span> <span id="s382">But anyway, that was sort of an interesting life –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: – you know, to – to have been stranded in Antigua – there again, they had money, which helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: You know.</span> <span id="s387">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Well, you know, when you think of – according to, you know, the – the purpose of why we do these interviews, they’re Holocaust related.</span> <span id="s389">And you can say that okay, how much of the actual Holocaust does someone experience in Antigua, but their lives were affected by these policies.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: There’s no question about that, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: There’s no – there’s no question.</span> <span id="s393">I mean, you know, I can – I said to somebody the other day, and I said, you know, I’ve now been in Washington – oh, how’s my – how old’s my daughter?</span> <span id="s394">Fifty-six, so I’ve been here 56 years, in Washington.</span> <span id="s395">In the state I’ve been longer.</span> <span id="s396">But I said, you know, normally, I should be in Frankfurt, with my entire whole family together, but everybody’s someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: You know, the family is – was absolutely –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Scattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: – scattered everywhere.</span> <span id="s401">And that – that is an impact to – I mean, it is not, of course, a concentration camp or anything like that, but – but it does affect you.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s403">Well, tell me about your grandparents.</span> <span id="s404">Of all of the pieces of the puzzle now, that we’ve had a –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yeah, my mother’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Your mother’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Well, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What were they like?</span> <span id="s409">Who were they and what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Well, they – my grandmother was about probably three inches taller than my grandfather.</span> <span id="s411">Very tall, erect person.</span> <span id="s412">I’ll show you pictures later.</span> <span id="s413">And my grandfather was a very nice man, rather short, like my husband too, and we are all short.</span> <span id="s414">And his – his nickname was Bubish(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Bubish(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s417">But his name was Ludwig, Ludwig Arnold.</span> <span id="s418">All the Hahns were L.A.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: And – because that’s what the fa – firm was called.</span> <span id="s421">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: But did the L.A. in the firm stand for Ludwig Arnold?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, I think originally it stood for Louis Aldous(ph), or something like that, for a great – they were all L.A.s.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: And – but he he was Ludwig Arnold.</span> <span id="s426">And they lived – they had a house in Frankfurt, not far from the bank.</span> <span id="s427">And in fact, it was close to the elementary school I went to, and I sometimes went there after school, you know, in – in Germany school is only til lunchtime, and – or used to be.</span> <span id="s428">And then they had that house in Switzerland – in – in Königstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Correct, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: And – where they spent time – they traveled a great deal, and they had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s431">I wish some were left, but – but that –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Well, did you feel it when you were with them, in how they lived, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No, none of my family lived like they had a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: So, they weren’t ostentatious.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Nah.</span> <span id="s438">But, I mean, okay, they had – they had a car, and a sofa, you know, but – but so did other people, I mean that – but they were – didn’t live in a mansion –</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: – they lived in a – in a house, and they had that other house in Königstein, but – and they traveled a lot, but you know – and I never knew that we had money.</span> <span id="s441">I met a woman here, no – a few years ago again, that I went to high school with, by chance, and she said to me, well, you were the rich girl.</span> <span id="s442">I said, I was?</span> <span id="s443">And she said, well, you had a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: So, you know, but that just didn’t register.</span> <span id="s446">And you know, you don’t pay attention.</span> <span id="s447">Unless you live ostentatious, you don’t pay attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: I mean, we – I had to take the streetcar to – to go to school, or my bicycle.</span> <span id="s450">I mean, no – no chauffeur took me to school, and – or picked me up, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s451">We had no sofa, my parents, and my mother got a car early, a Peugeot, in 1929, I think.</span> <span id="s452">And she was a good driver, and my father was not a very good driver.</span> <span id="s453">But she was a good driver.</span> <span id="s454">And I know it was one of the early cars in Frankfurt, and – but anyway, my grandparents no – and then – I can’t quite remember, but in – I think it was in 1929, when my grandfather was 70, we all stayed – went to Locarno –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: In Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: – and we all stayed in a hotel, and – and – to celebrate my grandfather’s birthday, my sister and I had to do a little sketch that my aunt had written.</span> <span id="s457">Terrible.</span> <span id="s458">But – and I think it was at that time that they looked at property in – in the – in Ticino, on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And Ticino, is – is in Switzerland as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes, on the Laco Maggiore.</span> <span id="s461">And my mother’s cousin, Albert Hahn –</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Moment.</span> <span id="s463">You can’t leave, beca-because of the mike.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, oh.</span> <span id="s465">Okay.</span> <span id="s466">Well, I’ll show you the book later.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s468">Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Albert Hahn, who was also at the bank, was a – a well-known economist.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: He was my grandfather’s nephew, and he bought a house right there, at – near Ascona.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Can you tell me – you mentioned this place before; was it on the – Ticino on a lake?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Ah, no, Ticino is – it’s the county.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: And the lake is the Laco Maggiore.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Uh-huh, that’s what I was – Laco Mazora(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s478">And the Laco Maggiore is half in Italy and half in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: And Ticino is the Italian county or whatever they’re called, in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s481">You know, Switzerland is – is three parts, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: – Italian, French and German.</span> <span id="s484">And Ticino is the Italian part.</span> <span id="s485">And I think my mother’s cousin bought the house there in ninet – when we were all there.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: In 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: And the first time we went there for vacation, I think, was in 1932, but we stayed at my cousin’s, at my uncle’s house.</span> <span id="s488">And at that point, I think my grandparents bought a house there, but I’m – I’m not sure of the date when they bought it, but they – it wa – by 1933 they had a house in Switzerland, on the lake.</span> <span id="s489">And I think it was the end of ’33, or early ’34 that they left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And you mentioned in what you wrote to us there, they also had Swiss citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yeah, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: How did they come by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Well, they had dual citizenship.</span> <span id="s494">I’ll tell you, this goes back, I think, maybe to the war of 1848, or something like that, or maybe the 1870 war.</span> <span id="s495">I’m not sure which war, but some war, where you could not serve if you had different citizenship, and you could buy the Swiss citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Which is what one fwo – great-grandfather of – I can’t – I don’t know who, but one of the great-grand – my – either my great-grandfather on my mother’s side, or my great-great-grandfather on my mother’s side, bought the Swiss citizenship.</span> <span id="s498">And from there on, they were all – they all had dual citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Who knew that that could be so useful?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Right.</span> <span id="s501">It was extremely useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: And so i-it was, I think, in ’33, or ’34 that my grandparents decided to move to Switzerland permanently.</span> <span id="s504">And as I wrote to you, they gave up that German citizenship at the consulate in Lugano, I think, and the consul asked why.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: And what did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: And my grandmother said, three guesses.</span> <span id="s507">Well, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Well, tell me a little bit about – oh, if you wanted to say something, I don’t want to interrupt you.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No, no, that – it was just – it was just very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: You know, I mean, that really – all of that – you know, relationships in families are very important, and make a lot of difference.</span> <span id="s512">And I’ll tell you why I say this.</span> <span id="s513">The bank, I told you, was in – was a company with shares, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: – public.</span> <span id="s516">However, it was – all the shares were family held.</span> <span id="s517">And my grandfather and this nephew that I was talking about, were chairmen, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Erish(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, Albert, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Oh, Albert Hahn the economist.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s522">They – they were – Albert Hahn also was a professor at the university in Frankfurt, but I mean, his main job was at the bank.</span> <span id="s523">And then, of course, in ’33, it all became more difficult.</span> <span id="s524">My mother’s sister’s husband was also at the bank, but he was not very competent.</span> <span id="s525">Was a nice guy, but not very competent.</span> <span id="s526">And my father at that point, was working at a different bank that belonged to my grandmother’s brother.</span> <span id="s527">And then, in ’34 or so, I think, they asked my father to leave that bank and come to the Deutsche Effecten Wechselbank.</span> <span id="s528">But of course, all of that, I mean nu – and – and my grandfather left, and the nephew left.</span> <span id="s529">But of course, it still was a bank with a lot of Jewish connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: And the – the se – many – much of the shares were held by the family.</span> <span id="s532">When my grandmother had a – a cousin – I – I’m never quite sure what the relationship is, but it’s sort of a cousin, or a nephew, or whatever, who had been the black sheep in the family, and had been exiled by the family to South Africa, where fortunately, he went into diamond mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: And he did extremely well.</span> <span id="s535">In fact, he was knighted by the Queen of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: And because they did a lot of charity work then.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: And nobody in the family had been friendly with him, but my grandmother was always friendly with him.</span> <span id="s540">And I remember the guy very well, because he used to come bring me big boxes of chocolates.</span> <span id="s541">And I also have a very beautiful diamond brooch that he gave my mother.</span> <span id="s542">So anyway, they kept up very closely, and of course, he was British by now, and his family acquired the shares.</span> <span id="s543">So that during the Nazi time, the shares were all in British ownership, which made an enormous difference, of course, because they couldn’t really –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Touch them.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: – reach the bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: So the money was saved, and s –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: It was – it was more or less saved, yes.</span> <span id="s548">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And did your family relations say – stay intact, with these kinds of changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Which is also quite an achievement, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s553">And I know – I mean, I remember, this guy’s name was Max Michaelas(ph), and – and Lady Michaelas(ph), I remember her, you know.</span> <span id="s554">And – and after the war, my niece went to stay with their kids in England, you know, so – I mean, I’ve lost track of them now, but it’s, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: – it’s a long time ago.</span> <span id="s557">But at – that must –</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: So, if I can back up to understand this better, it meant that during the time right when the Nazis come to power in 1933, your grandfather has these family connections, where they have some foresight as to they see where things are going, and they transfer the ownership –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Well, they bought them, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: – or they bought them, or whatever, to the other branch of the family that was, by now, British.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And that way, because it was British holdings within Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: – the government couldn’t go after it.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: I mean, they tried their level best to get the bank to close.</span> <span id="s566">And I know my father had many headaches.</span> <span id="s567">But then, of course – and they were supposed to merge with the – with the bank called Frankfurter Bank.</span> <span id="s568">Well, fortunately, the Frankfurter Bank was destroyed by an air raid.</span> <span id="s569">So that went out –</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Was the – can I ask also, the bank that your grandparents had, was it a very large bank within Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: It was a private bank, like a lot of private banks in Frankfurt were.</span> <span id="s572">I think it was well respected and pretty big.</span> <span id="s573">Not – but not like the Bank of America or anything, it was simply a private bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: By private, does that mean it wasn’t a consumer bank, it was a corporate bank, it was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No, it was, you know, you could have your account there, and people –</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: – and they have tellers.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And they have branches?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yeah – no, no branches, what – just one.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: One.</span> <span id="s581">One building.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: But they had tellers and – and they had a seat on the stock exchange, and all the rest of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: So, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did it conta – and when your father was invited to come into the family bank –</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: – as it were, did he then become the director of the bank?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Because he was Aryan?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: And actually he and – and my aunt’s husband was also Aryan.</span> <span id="s595">He –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: I thought he was Jewish, the aunt –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No, my aunt – my mother’s sister –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Nora.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: – no, her husband won – her daughter married a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Oh, I see, it was – it wa – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: But her husband was not a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: And so the two of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: But as I said before, her husband was not so bright.</span> <span id="s606">He was a nice guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s608">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: But – but was what – best I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: And – and so anyway, tho-those two and he – but he retired during the war.</span> <span id="s612">So then my father was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So pretty mu – so in other words another significant, what I would say fact, is that they family business did not get destroyed during the war, it remained throughout the war to the end.</span> <span id="s614">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Right.</span> <span id="s616">I mean, the building was pretty well – not destroyed, but was pretty damaged.</span> <span id="s617">But it’s in the middle of Frankfurt, and as you know, Frankfurt was 80 percent destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: So, you know, it – it had a lot of damage, but they –</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: But as a business.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: But – yeah, as a business they stayed.</span> <span id="s622">And of course, how banking, you know, it was altogether different.</span> <span id="s623">What was very nice – you know, Frankfurt was occupied in nine – in March of 1945, a couple of months before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s624">And I think the day after we were occupied, this Jeep drove up and asked for my father, and he was there, because at that point nobody went anyplace.</span> <span id="s625">And they took him in the Jeep, and left.</span> <span id="s626">And we were a little worried, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I mean, they were Americans, of course, but you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: – we were a little worried.</span> <span id="s631">And then he came back, which pleased us.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: And he said he had been asked to reopen the banks in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: All of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Well, to – to open the trade again.</span> <span id="s636">Because obviously OSS knew exactly who we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: There was no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: So that was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: And then he said yes, the Americans had that – this and that and the other, so I said to him, as long as you’re talking to the Americans, ask them if – I could work there as an interpreter, and I did.</span> <span id="s643">So – but it was a scary minute when they came with the Jeep and picked him up and we didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: And you didn’t know why, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: – and it had just been occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s649">Well, this is – it’s an interesting part of the story, but we have jumped over a bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Let’s go back to the 30s, and let’s see if I can ask one last question about your grandparents.</span> <span id="s652">Grandma’s taller than Grandpa.</span> <span id="s653">His – his nickname is Bubish(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: – Bubish(ph).</span> <span id="s656">And did you enjoy being around them?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s658">Well, you know, of course, it was a different time.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: And I certainly didn’t have the relationship with my grandparents that I have with my own grandchildren now.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Because they were people of respect, you know, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: It’s more formality.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s665">It wasn’t a ra – I liked them and they liked us, but it wasn’t a close relation – I mean, I – I would not go and tell them a story, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s666">But – and my grandparent – my grandfather had a – a favorite thing.</span> <span id="s667">When my parents called, if we were in – in one of their houses in Königstein, and my parents called and say how are the kids, and my grandfather would say, they are so nice when they’re asleep.</span> <span id="s668">But that was a favorite saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: But you know, they were nice, and – and I enjoyed them, but I can’t say I had a close relationship with them.</span> <span id="s671">But we enjoyed each other.</span> <span id="s672">And then they – my grandfather died in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: In 1945, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well, in 1941, my mother and my aunt were at that point both in the United States.</span> <span id="s679">My mother lived in Tucson, and my aunt lived in Santa Monica.</span> <span id="s680">And my grandparents decided to come and spend Christmas with them in 1941.</span> <span id="s681">Which was not a good idea, because that way they couldn’t get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Because you know what happened in 1941.</span> <span id="s684">So they were stuck in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s685">So they spent the war in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: On the other hand it’s a very good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: So then my fa – and my grandfather died there.</span> <span id="s688">I mean, he was 89, but you know, he – he died there, and my grandmother went back to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: After he died.</span> <span id="s691">She went back in ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: So a – yes, it’s – Switzerland was safe, but still, Los Angeles was a bit safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Oh yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s694">But they – I think they were sorry they were not in their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: In Switzerland, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: What is it that I wanted to ask you now?</span> <span id="s698">Ah, at the very beginning you mentioned that there were many mixed marriages in Frankfurt –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: – when your parents got married.</span> <span id="s701">Tell me a little bit about identity, if one can.</span> <span id="s702">Was your family, your mother’s side of the family very Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: No, apparently not.</span> <span id="s704">I mean, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: And how does one define not being very Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yeah, I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s707">I mean, I all – I always knew that my grandparents were Jews, and that my mother was Jewish by heritage.</span> <span id="s708">Which, I know a lot of other girls I knew who were in the same boat did not know, and were absolutely shocked in ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s711">I knew several of them, where they just never knew that they had any connection to Jews.</span> <span id="s712">My grandparents, I don’t know that they ever went to synagogue, but I know Yom Kippur seemed to fall mainly during farm vacations, and we often spent our farm vacations at my grandparents’ house in Königstein, and my grandmother always locked herself into a bedroom on Yom Kippur, and said she was fasting.</span> <span id="s713">Now, my cousin, and we always said, well, she’s got the cupboard full of cookies, and she’s probably not fasting, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: She may well have been fasting.</span> <span id="s716">But that is all I know, that – that was the only Jewish thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: In the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s719">So they – as I said, my mother’s youngest sister, I think was a devout Jew, but I never knew her.</span> <span id="s720">And now –</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: So the fact that your parents came from different – now, was your father’s family Lutheran, or Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: German Reformed.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Oh, German Reformed, okay, so Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Which is much better than Lutheran, and has nothing to do with Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: No, it has nothing to do with Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I – I tell you, German Reformed was a small group in Frankfurt, which had been persecuted in the late 1800s.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yes, and we – our church – and I was brought up in that church – our church had – you couldn’t see from the outside that it was a church, it just looked like a house.</span> <span id="s729">Had no stained glass windows, no tower, no bell, no nothing.</span> <span id="s730">But inside there was a real church.</span> <span id="s731">And it was a small congregation.</span> <span id="s732">My father was very active in it after the war, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s733">He and my sister got into religion, and I don’t know why, but – which is not where I got.</span> <span id="s734">And so there were a lot of old Frankfurt families that belonged to the German Reform.</span> <span id="s735">There’s also French Reform, but – which came from the Huguenots, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: There were a lot of Huguenots that came from France to the Frankfurt area, and there – you find a lot of French names there.</span> <span id="s738">But this was German Reform.</span> <span id="s739">Now, we always had Christmas, and my mother’s birthday happened to be on the 25th of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Oh, the poor thing.</span> <span id="s741">No double presents.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s743">And my daughter’s on the 23rd.</span> <span id="s744">And I remember that my grandparents used to come for her birthday, and we always got Christmas presents.</span> <span id="s745">I mean, there was nothing of Hanukkah, anything like that.</span> <span id="s746">So, at – somehow they – they had sort of embraced my fam – my father’s family, and – and I don’t know, and I think a lot of those mixed marriages in Frankfurt were that way.</span> <span id="s747">And I knew a lot of people who were in mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s748">I – I think it was, if you pardon the expression, more the upper crust, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: But, it – it just was nothing unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: It’s interesting to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: You know, it’s interesting, because I had interviews with people at other parts of Europe –</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: – where there was a mixed marriage, and it was highly unusual, highly unusual.</span> <span id="s756">Be – it was different societies, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah – no, in Frankfurt it was every day, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Did you see yourself as Christian?</span> <span id="s759">Did you have any feeling of being Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, I tell you, I grew up, of course, since – since we seemed to be more on my father’s religion, I went to confirmation class, I was confirmed in the German Reform church.</span> <span id="s761">And then I married my husband.</span> <span id="s762">And he didn’t want to have anything to do with religion, period, because he said he can’t believe that any God would allow what happened, you know.</span> <span id="s763">So, he said, you do whatever you want to do.</span> <span id="s764">So since I grew up that way, I had both my kids baptized, which is more than my son has done, or – and it didn’t mean anything to me, it was – I did it more to please my father, because at that point he and my sister were very engaged in that church.</span> <span id="s765">And so I had them both baptized – they both went to – I joined briefly the Westmoreland Congregational Church here, because I was looking for a church that wasn’t too churchy.</span> <span id="s766">And so that was fine, and the kids went there for – for Sunday school, til they were about nine or 10, and then they said we – all we do is draw pictures.</span> <span id="s767">And they both went to [indecipherable] Friends, which of course, the Quaker school.</span> <span id="s768">Somehow I tend more to Jewish stuff now.</span> <span id="s769">It’s not that I would join a synagogue, or do anything on that order, but I find it more interesting.</span> <span id="s770">And you know, my daughter married a Jew, and – the family is interesting.</span> <span id="s771">I mean, my daughter married a Jew, Steven is in – belongs to the Episcopal church.</span> <span id="s772">His wife is a lapsed Catholic who won’t cross any church’s door.</span> <span id="s773">The kids were not baptized, but my daughter’s three boys were – had a Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s774">They – they –</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: And try and figure out the identity, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yeah, they belong to the synagogue, and now her two older boys – the middle boy is never going to – interested anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: You’re talking about your daughter’s children?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: My daughter’s three boys.</span> <span id="s779">The middle boy – the two older ones are in college, and my daughter has said to them, you know, you are Bar Mitzvahed, and you do what you want to do, and it’s your choi – call now.</span> <span id="s780">The older one claims that he kept the high holidays.</span> <span id="s781">The younger – the middle one will have nothing to do with any of it.</span> <span id="s782">The youngest one, who is still in high school, is very interested.</span> <span id="s783">So, you know, I think si – my son’s three children were baptized, but that’s about it.</span> <span id="s784">And I don’t think they ever go to church or do anything.</span> <span id="s785">It – you know, families are interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s787">And it also is a reality that somehow or other, you know, gets pushed into anar – you know, political forces.</span> <span id="s788">Because now I want to bring back to how somebody defines themself, is from the inside, and how you are defined by others from the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: So what I would like to talk about is – we didn’t mention this yet – your school years, when you went to public school.</span> <span id="s791">Not only di – yeah, so not only did kids see you as the rich girl –</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Well, I went to private school first.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s794">So let’s talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: The same one that my mother went to, my sister went to, and in fact, my nieces – my niece went to.</span> <span id="s796">A little private school in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s797">Now, for reasons that I cannot fathom, my sister had – who is two years old – who was two years older, as I told you, had changed to a public school, when she got into high school, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: And that public school was on the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s800">I don’t even know why, but it was supposed to be so good, you know.</span> <span id="s801">Which was fine.</span> <span id="s802">That was in 1931.</span> <span id="s803">Now, my time came in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: That’s a very crucial time.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Which is a different time.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: And for reasons that I cannot fathom, my parents decided I would go to the public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Hang on just a second here.</span> <span id="s809">We’re going to end this track.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Do that.</span> <span id="s811">I’ll have a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Okay – of our interview, and go onto another track in – shortly.</span> <span id="s813">So this is the end of track 13 of our interview with Judith Heimann, by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Good afternoon, this is track 14, and a conua – continuation of our interview with Mrs. Judith Heimann, in Bethesda, Maryland, on November 21st, 2011, and we were talking about schools –</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: – and your experience in school, and you were saying that when you started pub – public school, it was 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: And so what do you remember about that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Well, that was a very unfortunate choice that my parents made, I – I – I mentioned earlier that my mother was not well.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: And in early ’33, she had a nervous breakdown, which I think was related to Hitler’s taking o – my mother is one of the very few people that I know, who had read “Mein Kampf,” and knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s824">And so I think she had a nervous breakdown, and therefore didn’t really think about my school.</span> <span id="s825">I mean, I do – I don’t blame her, you know, when you’re sick, you’re sick.</span> <span id="s826">So anyway, they sent me to public school, and of course in 1933, you shouldn’t send a half-Jew to public school who – when you have a private school where you’ve been.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: The explanation was that that private school would require Greek for graduation, and they didn’t want to have me do that, but you know, I-I – I think that’s a lame excuse, because you know, other kids could learn it too, so why couldn’t I have learned what I needed to learn?</span> <span id="s829">But in any case, they sent me –</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Do you think they just weren’t thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: I think nobody thought much, because I think it was a horrible time.</span> <span id="s832">A-And you know, you change schools in Germany, or you didn’t; in any case, I don’t know what it’s like now; on Easter, after Easter, that’s when the new year starts.</span> <span id="s833">And that was pretty soon after Hitler took over, and I think they just never thought.</span> <span id="s834">In any case, I went to that school, and there was one a – one more half-Jewish girl in the class, and one girl who was a full Jew, and the rest were not.</span> <span id="s835">The other half-Jewish girl, unfortunately her last name was Solomon, which of course, a much more Jewish name than Bartmann was.</span> <span id="s836">And we had a classroom teacher who was really a Nazi.</span> <span id="s837">And some of the other teachers were too, and of course, some of the girls were.</span> <span id="s838">And it was not always pleasant.</span> <span id="s839">There – I – I did have two or three friends, or four sa – more even.</span> <span id="s840">In fact, one of my high school friends is still alive, like I am.</span> <span id="s841">She lives in Frankfurt, and my niece takes care of her, because she never married, and she’s alone, and so my niece takes care of her.</span> <span id="s842">But – and she was my friend.</span> <span id="s843">I’ll tell you about her in a minute, because she is also an interesting case.</span> <span id="s844">But, you know, like on Saturdays, for instance – you were always on the outside – on Saturdays, anybody who belonged to the BDM, you know, Bund Deutscher Machen(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Bund Deutscher Mädel.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: – was off.</span> <span id="s847">But those of us who didn’t, had to come to school.</span> <span id="s848">And there were about 10 of us in the class, six or eight who had to come to school, and then we had meaningless classes, because we had to have meaningless class, because the others weren’t there.</span> <span id="s849">But, you know, you were an outsider.</span> <span id="s850">I mean, you weren’t part of the group.</span> <span id="s851">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Did the teachers treat you differently?</span> <span id="s853">Were they – was – was your teacher, for example, did she treat you differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Well, we had this one tea – they were mostly men, their – the classroom teacher was our Latin teacher also, and I don’t know, I got terrible grades.</span> <span id="s855">I was very poor – I-I wouldn’t say I was – I never did homework, which didn’t help.</span> <span id="s856">And – and I was a little heavy at the time, and quite busty.</span> <span id="s857">And he would always say, you seem to be leaning on the table like a pudding.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Oh, that’s very cruel to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Which is not really what you like to hear, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: And in any case, from him I got horrible grades.</span> <span id="s862">I think he taught Latin and French.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: How does one say that, by the way, in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: You’re leaning on the table like a pudding.</span> <span id="s866">[speaks German]</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: [speaks German]</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: That’s very cruel to a 13 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Oh, it’s horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: And I got really terrible grades, and – and the more – I think he tried psychology on me, but it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s872">And the more he did this, the worse I got in school.</span> <span id="s873">And a – one semester he was not there, and I got very good grades from some other teacher.</span> <span id="s874">So, I mean, I – I think a lot had to do with that.</span> <span id="s875">In any case, I went there for three years, and I really – I mean, I wasn’t unhappy, but it was just not a good experience.</span> <span id="s876">It – it was stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: So – but you felt the – you felt the atmosphere, I guess that – that’s what –</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s879">Now, for instance, we had – the school had sort of a summer place, or a – a place in the country where they would take the – each class for – for a week at a time, or something.</span> <span id="s880">Now, the girl who was a full Jew was not allowed to go.</span> <span id="s881">And the other one who wa – whose name was Solomon, they debated for a long time whether she could go.</span> <span id="s882">Now, they didn’t say anything to me, because my last name was –</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Bartmann, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: – different.</span> <span id="s885">But, you know, you always weren’t sure, were you go – were you gonna be able to do this, and of course, you want to do this when –</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: – go with your class, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: And there were many things like that, that you felt people are looking at you in a different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Was this – are you say-saying now, not only in school, but in general, when you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Well, that came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: That was not in school, I didn’t notice that so much.</span> <span id="s894">But somehow it was – it was very unfortunate.</span> <span id="s895">And then my sister had gone to boarding school in England, in 1935, I think.</span> <span id="s896">And in 1936 – I-I’m trying to get the dates right, yes, I think it was 1936, they decided I would go to – to a – a boarding school in England.</span> <span id="s897">And I ha – I didn’t know this til almost the end of the school year – of course, that was the time nobody asked you if you want to do this, you were just simply told, that’s what you’re doing.</span> <span id="s898">And so I said to that classroom teacher, I said, I’m leaving.</span> <span id="s899">Whereupon he said to me, if you had told me sooner, I would have given you the grades you really deserve, but I didn’t know you weren’t coming back.</span> <span id="s900">Which was very interesting, you know.</span> <span id="s901">So he said, you really deserved better.</span> <span id="s902">But anyway, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: – you – you just don’t know.</span> <span id="s905">So I went to boarding school in England, which I absolutely hated.</span> <span id="s906">My sister loved it, I just absolutely hated it.</span> <span id="s907">But part of it, I think, was because my mother had left Germany at the end of ’34, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Is that when she left the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s910">That’s when she went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: And it may have been early ’35, like I’m not a hundred percent sure of the date.</span> <span id="s913">And my sister had gone to boarding school, so I was home alone with my father, who was very lenient, and I did what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s914">Not homework for sure, but – but everything else.</span> <span id="s915">I just had a good time.</span> <span id="s916">And then I went to England to this boarding school, where every minute of the day is programmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s918">It’s like prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I mean there – yeah.</span> <span id="s920">I mean, there is no escape.</span> <span id="s921">You leave your – at that time, you – you leave your bedroom, which, well the bedroom was for all the girls, at 7:30 in the morning for breakfast, and you’re not allowed to come back til the evening.</span> <span id="s922">You have to take everything you have to have, with you.</span> <span id="s923">Well, I hated the whole place, and I was there for one year.</span> <span id="s924">Nobody had asked me if I wanted to go, but I went.</span> <span id="s925">And then, after the year, they decided I would go to Switzerland to learn French.</span> <span id="s926">Now there, I will say, they gave me a choice of two different schools, which I went, inspected with my father.</span> <span id="s927">And one of the things I had hated in that boarding school, among other things, was the bathrooms, which you shared with a million kids.</span> <span id="s928">So I chose the little school, where you had a bathroom where you could lock the door.</span> <span id="s929">So I went there, and there were only about 40 of us, maybe 35 kids.</span> <span id="s930">I really enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s931">It was very nice, I was very good in French, which I don’t remember at all any more, but it was – it was really very nice, and there were many girls from England, probably about 10 or 11 girls from London, and there were three Americans – no, there were four Americans.</span> <span id="s932">And then the rest was different.</span> <span id="s933">One girl was from Haifa, she was an Arab, and there were some Italians and a couple of Swiss.</span> <span id="s934">It was interesting – and that’s a sideline that I knew there was a big kerfuffle at the beginning, in the American room – they – they stupidly, they – there was one other German girl, and I don’t know why they would put us together in a room with – with a Greek girl and an Italian girl, and they put all four American girls into one room.</span> <span id="s935">And I knew there was a big kerfuffle, but I never understood – I mean, we just didn’t know.</span> <span id="s936">And it was only after I was in this country for a while, and looked at the pictures that I realized that one of the girls was black.</span> <span id="s937">Very light black, but she was black.</span> <span id="s938">And I’m sure that’s what the kerfuffle was all about.</span> <span id="s939">She was from San Francisco, her name was Georgia Naifi(ph).</span> <span id="s940">I – I got invited to her wedding, but of course it was during the war, so I didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: But, you know, it didn’t dawn on me.</span> <span id="s943">I never even saw that she was black when I was over there.</span> <span id="s944">I’d never seen a black girl, and she was very light, and you know, what did I know?</span> <span id="s945">I never knew she was black, but when I looked at old pictures, I suddenly thought, now I know what went on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Now, I come back to the same question that I had earlier, of how you perceive yourself, and how other perceive you.</span> <span id="s947">In that school, in the school in Switzerland, were you seen as a German girl, or a Jewish girl, or both, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: I – I think as a German girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: And in London – or in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: In England, a German girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: A German girl, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No question.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: And in – now, in that school in Switzerland we had a couple of Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s955">I mean, I know one of the American girls was a Jew from New York, and we had an interesting British girl, Naomi de Rothschild, whom I visited in London with a butler and a elevator in the – a really – now they really lived, you know.</span> <span id="s956">But it was – no, I – I mean, I would look the par – I don’t know about the other German girl.</span> <span id="s957">She was clearly an Aryan.</span> <span id="s958">If she was a Nazi, I’m not – I really can’t tell, because at that point we – we don’t talk about that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: So, outside of the country, what was going on politically didn’t have muc – in school life, didn’t have an im-impact.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Inside Germany, you had felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Oh yes, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: I felt it clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Now, at home, you said your mother had read “Mein Kampf,” that she had a nervous breakdown when the Nazis came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Had there been political discussions in your home about what’s going on in the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: There were dis – political discussions, yes, and I know, you know, as I said before, we had – there were maids, and they were all Catholics, and they all asked my parents how to vote always.</span> <span id="s969">And so we – we heard all these things, you know.</span> <span id="s970">And there were the discussions on – you know, at that point I can’t remember, you know, the Nazis killed off one of their own, I can’t remember what his name was, but – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: The Brownshirts, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Down in Munich?</span> <span id="s974">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: And so, all this kind of stuff, we – we did discuss at home.</span> <span id="s977">I mean, we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s978">There was no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: And from the household staff, were there any – was there anybody who distanced themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: They were all very loyal.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s985">No question.</span> <span id="s986">And the – the woman who was hired when she was, I think 24, when I was born, died in Tucson, because she came – she stayed in England at my mother’s house all during the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: My.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: – and then came to a – to this country, and she died in Tucson.</span> <span id="s989">But – and the other maids also were really very loyal.</span> <span id="s990">And then the maid that we had that my friend says I’m always quoting, she came to us during the war.</span> <span id="s991">In fact, I hired her.</span> <span id="s992">She had been a maid with a Jewish family in Frankfurt who left, and she was extremely fond of them, and then was very happy with us too.</span> <span id="s993">So we were lucky in – with these people.</span> <span id="s994">But anyway, then after that year in –</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: – Switzerland, it was decided that I would go back to England and live with my mother and her husband, and go to school.</span> <span id="s997">And I went to Saint Paul’s Girls’ School, which was – I went there as a day student, and I mean, they also had a boarding thing, but I was a day student.</span> <span id="s998">And I graduated from that school, and I took – I can never think of it, if it was A levels or O levels, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s999">But in any case, it was a level to – that immediately –</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Gets you into university.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: – it took me into the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1003">I think they’re A levels.</span> <span id="s1004">I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I ca – I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1006">But I still have the certificate somewhere, but anyway, that was in 1939, and I went home for the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: And that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1010">So after that, you go home for the summer, and then there’s August 23rd, which is the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and September first with the invasion of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: And how did – do you remember where you were and ho – what you thought, what you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Well, I remember exactly where I was on the first of September, because I was at the public swimming pool in Frankfurt with a guy I knew, and we were lying on the grass, and we heard it on the radio.</span> <span id="s1014">And I said well, I guess by the time – by this time next week, we won’t be lying in the grass any more, we’d be bombed.</span> <span id="s1015">Well, of course, took another two years to get any air raids in Frankfurt, but I don’t know, I think, in retrospect, I think I probably could have left in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: That summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1018">From Frankfurt to go back to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: It was not what I had planned, I – my parents had given me a trip to America as a graduation present.</span> <span id="s1021">Now, here’s the irony.</span> <span id="s1022">We were suppo – my father and I were going on the Bremen.</span> <span id="s1023">We were supposed to leave August 22nd.</span> <span id="s1024">My father had a important meeting on the 24th, so we changed the tickets to September third.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: And the Bremen –</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s1028">Didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Was the end of that.</span> <span id="s1030">So that’s the irony.</span> <span id="s1031">I would have been in this country.</span> <span id="s1032">Of course, my father might have been unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: But it would have been interesting.</span> <span id="s1035">Or, I might have been able, you know, if I had foresight, and my parents had foresight, I mean, I don’t know, I mean, I might have been able to get on a train and go to be – go back to London in time.</span> <span id="s1036">But, on the other hand, I was very fond of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Was he the po – parent you were closer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I think because of my mother’s illness, you know.</span> <span id="s1039">And of course, I didn’t like her second husband, as you know, as I said before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: And I would have had to go back and live with them, and I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1042">And you know, you’re 19, you don’t pay attention.</span> <span id="s1043">You know, you – you live every day as it comes along, and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: You live in a different way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Yeah, you figure everything’s gonna work out just fine, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: And – and I will say, all of us thought, at home, that the war would last a year, or maybe two, because Germany would be defeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Did you fi – okay, let’s go back to another part of the identity.</span> <span id="s1049">Did you feel yourself to be German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: And, when I came in earlier, you know, one of the things that you said before we started recording, is the irony and the sadness of hoping that your own country –</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: – loses.</span> <span id="s1054">Gets occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: It was sad, you know, it is sad.</span> <span id="s1056">I was clearly, I – I was German, you know, and – and – and just think – I mean, it’s a different story, but just think when this country, we lost Vietnam, which was annoying, to put it mildly.</span> <span id="s1057">But, you know, when it’s – when you’re in the country, and you know the only way this country can really survive, and you can survive, is if that country –</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Loses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: – loses the war.</span> <span id="s1060">I knew if the – if we didn’t lose the war, we were goners, you know, there was no question in my mind.</span> <span id="s1061">So, for very selfish reasons –</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: – you hoped that the country will lose the war.</span> <span id="s1064">But it’s hard when it’s your own country, because I was clearly German.</span> <span id="s1065">There wasn’t any question in my mind.</span> <span id="s1066">So it – it wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: It’s heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s1068">It’s actually quite heartbreaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yeah, it – it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: I wanted to ask – I mean, we – one of the – as I said – bless you – one of the unusual parts of your experience is that you were able to hide in plain sight throughout the war.</span> <span id="s1071">Have a drink, have a drink.</span> <span id="s1072">Sure, hang on just a second.</span> <span id="s1073">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: This is a continuation of our interview with – the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Judith Heimann.</span> <span id="s1076">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Okay, so anyway, it – it was – it was very hard for my sister, because you know, she had that baby, and she had to go back to work.</span> <span id="s1078">And I worked – oh, I haven’t told you about my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: No, I wanted to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: I – I – well, when I go back a little bit to ’39, because I told you we only thought the war would last very short.</span> <span id="s1081">So, my father decided that I should go to Berlin, to a household school, you know, e-economy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: How to run a household.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1084">Which is really stupid.</span> <span id="s1085">So, we went to Berlin, we got a room, I got a room.</span> <span id="s1086">We went – I went to this school where there were mainly young women who were planning to get married very soon, you know.</span> <span id="s1087">So I wasn’t planning on that.</span> <span id="s1088">And you know, that was very interesting because you know, I was in a strange territory, nobody knew me.</span> <span id="s1089">I wasn’t about to say anything about my heritage, or anything else.</span> <span id="s1090">And there was one girl who at one point said to me – I was friendly with her, and she said to me, you know, I have to ask you a question, and I don’t want you to take it the wrong way.</span> <span id="s1091">And I said, so, what is it?</span> <span id="s1092">He said, are you half Jewish?</span> <span id="s1093">And I said, why are you asking this?</span> <span id="s1094">And she said, where I come from there’s a family by the name of Bartmann and they’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1095">And I said, well that happens to be my Aryan side.</span> <span id="s1096">And I said, yes I am.</span> <span id="s1097">And she said, so am I. And, but you know, neither one of us had said anything to anybody else, and in fact, I was friendly with one woman who I’m sure never knew, and I wasn’t about to tell her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Well, it could be dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, there wasn’t any point.</span> <span id="s1100">And the – this one girl who was half Jewish also, got married to a Norwegian, and we all went to the wedding.</span> <span id="s1101">It was very nice, but you know, that – that was interesting, but of course, the war wasn’t over, you know.</span> <span id="s1102">And so I came back, and then I ha – I don’t quite remember this, but somehow I think I went someplace to learn Spanish, which I have never mastered in my entire life; I’ve taken three more Spanish classes, I just can’t do – seem to do it.</span> <span id="s1103">But anyway, and then I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1104">And you know, the – the thing that completely disrupted my life, is that I had always wanted to go to medical school, from probably the time I was 12 or 13.</span> <span id="s1105">And of course, in Germany I was not permitted.</span> <span id="s1106">And in England I had been – you know, I had started – I was gonna go to the University of London Medical School, but you know, so that was out.</span> <span id="s1107">And so I felt, well, maybe I could work at a doctor’s office.</span> <span id="s1108">And we knew a guy who was a radiologist, who also had some Jewish connections, and he said, well, I’ll ask some of my colleagues, you know.</span> <span id="s1109">So this doctor called, and said, would I come and be interviewed.</span> <span id="s1110">He had joined the Nazi party in 1933, which is early.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Very early, hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: He had a practice, a medical practice in the blue collar area in Frankfurt, near the main railroad station.</span> <span id="s1113">His main patients, all his patients were what here you would call Medicare patients, you know, on – on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Assistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yeah, on – in – a – a lot of them were railroad workers, and – and the other were blue collar workers.</span> <span id="s1116">And he interviewed me, and he said yeah, I think it’s fine, and you look right, you know.</span> <span id="s1117">And then he – for some reason they have to go to the AMA – I mean, the equivalent of the AMA in Germany to say they are hiring, and they told him he couldn’t hire a half-Jew.</span> <span id="s1118">And he said – now, this Nazi said to them, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s1119">Then I’ll close my practice.</span> <span id="s1120">And of course they couldn’t afford that, because he had all these blue collar workers and those regular workers.</span> <span id="s1121">So they said okay, hire her.</span> <span id="s1122">And I will tell you, they were the loveliest people.</span> <span id="s1123">They had an apartment – two apartments put together, and one was the practice, and the other was the – where they lived.</span> <span id="s1124">He and his wife, they had two sons and a daughter.</span> <span id="s1125">It was hard work, because we had to be there – I had to be there at eight o’clock in the morning, and then we worked til about 1:30 or so, and then there were two hours off, and then I was back at 3:30, and then we worked til eight o’clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: That’s quite long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: I mean, you know, they had a lot of patients, and there weren’t that many doctors, and I did everything.</span> <span id="s1128">I mean, he taught me everything.</span> <span id="s1129">I did the insurance, I did the lab work.</span> <span id="s1130">I mean, the guy taught me everything.</span> <span id="s1131">He had a horrible temper, and would yell.</span> <span id="s1132">And the first time he yelled at me, I got up and said, when you’re done, I’ll come back here.</span> <span id="s1133">And from then on, when he was in a bad humor, his wife would say to me, Miss Bartmann, you deal with it.</span> <span id="s1134">And he was – he was – they were just the loveliest people.</span> <span id="s1135">I mean, I can’t begin to tell you how wonderful they were.</span> <span id="s1136">And you know, every day in – about for – five o’clock, she would open the door and say come in, have a cup of tea, you know.</span> <span id="s1137">And they – they were – and their kids were nice, and I mean they were ab –</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Do you think he joined the party because of a purely career move?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I can’t – I can’t – I have no idea, I never asked him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: So that never came up in conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: No.</span> <span id="s1142">I never asked him, and it just – we never talked about those things.</span> <span id="s1143">He certainly was no Nazi at that point.</span> <span id="s1144">And, you know, I think he had no idea what he was joining.</span> <span id="s1145">And he – unfortunately, at the end of 19 – no, early in 1944 – late in 1943, or early in four – in ’44, they were bombed out.</span> <span id="s1146">And they moved to Schlangenbad, which is not far from Frankfurt, where he opened a practice.</span> <span id="s1147">And they asked me to come with them, but at that point my niece was born, and I – and my sister was working, and I felt I had to stay home.</span> <span id="s1148">And also, I really didn’t want to leave my father.</span> <span id="s1149">So I said, no, I – I think I won’t.</span> <span id="s1150">And so he said, well, we’ll see that you find another place that we know.</span> <span id="s1151">And some woman doctor first hired me, and then she was bombed out.</span> <span id="s1152">And then this guy who lived not very far, like from here to where you turn to Mass Avenue, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: – not terribly far.</span> <span id="s1155">He had his practice there, and he hired me.</span> <span id="s1156">Now, his wife was a quarter Jew.</span> <span id="s1157">She in fact, had been in school with my deceased aunt, my –</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Luchs(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: – mother’s youngest sister.</span> <span id="s1160">I knew exactly who she was.</span> <span id="s1161">He was the biggest Nazi you ever want to meet.</span> <span id="s1162">He treated me like a piece of dirt.</span> <span id="s1163">You know, at that point none of us knew the – the phrase sexual harassment, but the first week I was there, he chased me around the desk and kept saying, sit, come sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: On his knees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1166">And I said no, you know, and that was the end of his treating me as a person.</span> <span id="s1167">I mean, after that – and of course, I knew I couldn’t leave, because it was a job, and if I left the job, I – I risked being deported someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So, is this the reason why – cause I was trying to figure out earlier, when you said that if you had household help at home, you had to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: I didn’t know why you had to go to work if you had household help at home, and you have money, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1172">If you da – if you had no help, one of you could stay home to do the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: That’s how intrusive the party was, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1175">And if – but if you had help, you couldn’t stay home.</span> <span id="s1176">And being a half Jew, I would have been sent someplace –</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: – if I didn’t have a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: So they would have found work for you someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1181">What was precisely what he knew.</span> <span id="s1182">And he knew I couldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s1183">And I had said to him, all is fine, I just would like when we have an air raid, I would like to ride my bicycle home, because my niece – our maid had the baby, and I said I would like to be there with the baby during the air raid.</span> <span id="s1184">And he said, fine.</span> <span id="s1185">Well, he was a big shot in the [indecipherable] you know, and so as soon as there was an air raid siren, he put on his uniform and departed.</span> <span id="s1186">And he said, take all the files in the basement.</span> <span id="s1187">So, I – before anything else, I had to take the files in the basement.</span> <span id="s1188">And there were many a day when I ri – rode my bicycle home while the bombs were falling, because there wasn’t any other way to do it.</span> <span id="s1189">And it was dark, and you know, and you couldn’t put a light on your bicycle.</span> <span id="s1190">But I always made it home, and we – we were very lucky, we were not bombed out, although around us – I mean, sometimes you just don’t know why y-you were there.</span> <span id="s1191">I mean, we ha – we had incendiary bombs in the attic once, but we were able to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Get rid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1194">And – but he was really – oh, he was so awful, I mean, and he kept – he had what he said was an ulcer.</span> <span id="s1195">So he got extra food stamps, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: – for – yeah, for – for butter and stuff.</span> <span id="s1198">Do you think he shared it with his wife?</span> <span id="s1199">No.</span> <span id="s1200">It was all just in front of him.</span> <span id="s1201">And then he had private patients, and had others, you know, like Medicare.</span> <span id="s1202">And the private patients always got treated very well.</span> <span id="s1203">The others kept – you know, I always said, if they have diarrhea, they were told to take Kaopectate, and if they had something other, take three aspirins and go home, you know.</span> <span id="s1204">I mean, and – but the private patients –</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Different – different class, different treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: I – I mean, he was just awful.</span> <span id="s1207">And I’ll tell you, the best thing in my life – not the best thing in my life, but a nice thing in my life, we were occupied – I mean, you know, we were occupied in March.</span> <span id="s1208">And we knew it was coming, and you know, there was dead silence for two days.</span> <span id="s1209">I mean, so silent that you could hear a pin drop everywhere.</span> <span id="s1210">I mean, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1211">And I had gone to work, and he said to me, go to the police department and get an armband, a Red Cross armband for me, or something – which was on the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s1212">So I got on my bicycle, and went to the other side of the river, and got to the police department, where people knew me through my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1213">And they said, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1214">And I said, I need to get the – well, they said, you better get home they be – they’re blowing up the bridges.</span> <span id="s1215">And so I te – I snatched that thing, and went home, went to his place and threw it there and went home.</span> <span id="s1216">Never went back to his practice.</span> <span id="s1217">And the house next door to us – we lived on a cul-de-sac – and the house next door to us had been empty and was immediately occupied by American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1218">I don’t know how they knew it was empty, but there were American soldiers in there right away.</span> <span id="s1219">And my sister and I were outside, and you know, we both spoke English, of course.</span> <span id="s1220">And we were chatting with some of these kids.</span> <span id="s1221">And this Jeep comes, and they have my doctor in that Jeep.</span> <span id="s1222">So he says to me, he fe – he spoke no English.</span> <span id="s1223">He said to me, you speak English and German?</span> <span id="s1224">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1225">And he said, just tell them that I’m a very nice guy, and I, you know, mean no harm.</span> <span id="s1226">So I just said to them, I don’t know who he is.</span> <span id="s1227">And they took him.</span> <span id="s1228">I mean, they let him go right away after 24 hours –</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: – but, you know, he was wearing his stupid uniform, you know.</span> <span id="s1231">But I just decided I’m not going to say he’s a nice guy, just that I don’t really know who he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Do you think he figured it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Oh, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1234">You know, after I worked for the military government right away.</span> <span id="s1235">And his wife came to see me, maybe after a month or two, and asked me for what – what’s called – you may know or not know that expression, Persilschein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Persilschein?</span> <span id="s1237">Persilschein [German]</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Persil is a detergent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Ah, Persil, yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Persilschein is a piece of paper saying you were okay.</span> <span id="s1241">And it was called Persilschein.</span> <span id="s1242">So she asked me for one, for him, and I – I refused.</span> <span id="s1243">I said, I really can’t give it to you.</span> <span id="s1244">I only met him after – when it was so clear the war was over, or was going to be lost, that whoever would have been a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1245">I said, I can’t give you anything.</span> <span id="s1246">And I didn’t give him any.</span> <span id="s1247">And her – both her so – both their sons died in the war, and when the war was lost, she said to me, the world is coming to an end for my girls – they had two girls.</span> <span id="s1248">And I said, well, that’s your problem.</span> <span id="s1249">It didn’t have to be that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: But oh, they – you know, for – for – for a while when we lived in Tucson, I wouldn’t go into one supermarket because the guy there looked like – like this guy.</span> <span id="s1252">My husband kept saying, but you know it’s not him.</span> <span id="s1253">But he was really awful.</span> <span id="s1254">And you see, this is the kind of thing you run into.</span> <span id="s1255">And of course, there were a lot of people who didn’t know you any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: You know, who used to be your friend, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: And then not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: – just didn’t know you.</span> <span id="s1260">And believe me, I didn’t know them after the war, either.</span> <span id="s1261">I mean, I’m not that forgiving.</span> <span id="s1262">And we did have some very good friends, who would always come and no matter what, and they would come and – and visit, and come for dinner, or coffee, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1263">And there were several – but I know that for some of them, it was risky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Here’s a question.</span> <span id="s1265">You mentioned earlier that – you know, when we were talking about your own country being the one that you want to lose because – for a variety of reasons –</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: – but one of them is that you’re a goner if they don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Ri-Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1270">Did you feel physical – I mean, we’re talking about things that are highly unpleasant, but did you feel physical danger that you could be eliminated?</span> <span id="s1271">Did you feel that kind of fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: We felt fear at times that we would be deported someplace.</span> <span id="s1273">Not always.</span> <span id="s1274">You know, it would go in waves.</span> <span id="s1275">There were times when it was very quiet and you felt pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1277">And then other times –</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: And then – and then all of a sudden you’d feel they were looking again, and they were planning to do, and it was un – it was – now, I will also add that I was young, and when you’re young, you live with this, but you also have boys on your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: And – and you know, and you have a life, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1281">So, there are distractions.</span> <span id="s1282">It was much harder on my father, of course.</span> <span id="s1283">Of course, for him was the second war already, you know, he’d been – he was wounded in the first one, so – which is already dreadful, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: But you see, here – here’s a – here’s something that sounds like it’s a difference being half Jewish and full Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: That, if you are full Jewish, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Well, I couldn’t have stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: I mean, that would have been impo – now, I’ll tell you about my girlfriend, because it falls into the – now she, who is still alive in Frankfurt [indecipherable] at 91.</span> <span id="s1292">She’s a full Aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: But her own mother died when she was five, and her father married a Jew, a fi – girl from Frankfurt who was a Jew, who my girlfriend always regarded as her mother, because she was only six when my – when her father married this woman.</span> <span id="s1295">So, for all practical purposes, that woman was her mother.</span> <span id="s1296">However, for the Nazis, it made a big difference, because she had no Jewish blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: They lived in an apartment, in a very nice apartment, and they had to leave that apartment.</span> <span id="s1299">And they were billeted, so to speak, with another Jewish family in a house, who were awful to them.</span> <span id="s1300">However, my friend, who was a full Aryan, didn’t have to live there, so she got herself an apartment across the street from where her parents were billeted, and her parents mainly slept over there, and spent the rest of the day –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: At the – her dau – their daughter’s apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: At – at their daughter’s apartment.</span> <span id="s1303">However, the women then had – was taken to work in a factory in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1304">She tried to commit suicide, which didn’t succeed, and then she was deported to Theresienstadt, which of course happened – would have happened to us if we’d been full Jewish.</span> <span id="s1305">And it would have happened to us if the war had lasted a little longer.</span> <span id="s1306">But, she was surprised.</span> <span id="s1307">She came back, and lived to be 91.</span> <span id="s1308">But it was not a pleasant experience, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: I mean, she was in Theresienstadt a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: That’s long enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: That’s long enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: And of course, the transport itself was so horrible.</span> <span id="s1315">But she was a tough bird, and she always did exercises she told me, even in Theresienstadt, she did her exercises.</span> <span id="s1316">And she came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: So, in other words, you knew, even though you didn’t have this face of di – I’m trying to get a sense of the degree of knowledge of what was really going on, because it sounds like there was no knowledge about the camps, there was no knowledge about – but there was knowledge that there was – so this is why –</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: – I don’t want to put words in your mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: – oh no, I mean, I think we knew all about concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Okay, that’s what I’m trying to get a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: That – early on, probably in ’35, the father of a guy – well, this were the family in Frankfurt, he was taken – actually, he was not a Jew, but it was sort of a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s1325">And he wa – he was a director of a very big outfit, and I don’t know why they took him.</span> <span id="s1326">They took him, and they put him in a concentration camp, and after a half a year, they wrote his wife and said she could have the urn.</span> <span id="s1327">So, we knew.</span> <span id="s1328">Anybody who tells you they didn’t know that there were concentration camps, and what went on, I think is lying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: I – everybody knew.</span> <span id="s1331">We knew full well what was going on.</span> <span id="s1332">And – and you know, and that is something that was always in the back of your mind.</span> <span id="s1333">You know, it – it’s a stupid thing to say, but in some ways the air raids, and the disruption of everything, is what saved us, because there was lit – the communications weren’t any good any more, and you know, things weren’t going – if the war had gone better, we would have been a goner long ago.</span> <span id="s1334">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Do you think your father had to bribe people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Did the thought ever cross your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yes, I – the thought has crossed my mind many times, but I – I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s1339">He never said so.</span> <span id="s1340">But he also, even, you know, we always said we are very unfortunate, because people were trading stuff, you know; you have eggs, you have this, but we only have money, because we are the bank.</span> <span id="s1341">And nobody wanted money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: But they wanted eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Yeah, nobody wanted money.</span> <span id="s1344">But he – he also had a way with people, you know, that he could remind them of earlier times and all that, which I think, all of which helped.</span> <span id="s1345">I think the fact that he was a very good person who was an old, old family in Frankfurt, I think helped to some extent.</span> <span id="s1346">But of course, it wouldn’t have helped in the end.</span> <span id="s1347">I mean, you know, in the end, nothing helps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: And – and – and everybody knew what was going on, and I don’t know, you’re not a Catholic, are you?</span> <span id="s1350">You –</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Not a good one, but I am, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Well, I’m sorry to say, I think your cur-current pope is lying, because you current pope claims he was forced to join the Hitler youth, and I have never heard of anybody who was forced to do that.</span> <span id="s1353">I mean, maybe there was peer pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: That’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: That I don’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: That’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: But that’s not forced.</span> <span id="s1358">The guy is a liar.</span> <span id="s1359">But, you know, that’s the way that goes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Well, that’s – that’s one of the reasons I wanted to hear it from you, so that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: – you know, that ye – it’s hard to know – it’s – it’s that old question of, what did they know, and when did they know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yeah, that is always the question.</span> <span id="s1364">I’ll tell you, in – I was talking earlier about my public school, and the fact that there were about six or seven of us who were not – who had to appear on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s1365">Well, of course, there were only three of us who had some Jewish connection.</span> <span id="s1366">The other five or so had chosen not to join the BDM.</span> <span id="s1367">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: The BDM is the ger – association for young German women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Bund Deutscher Machen(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Bund de Deutschen(ph) Machen(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1373">The association of young German girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: It’s the same as the Hitler youth for boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: And – and they had chosen not to join, so obviously you didn’t have to join.</span> <span id="s1377">But, you know, I’m sure there was peer pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: But it’s a different word than using forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: But forcing was not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: But abso – I get mad every time I read this.</span> <span id="s1382">But, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: I can understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: He was probably a Nazi, and why not, you know?</span> <span id="s1385">He was from Bavaria, where they were all Nazis anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Well, tell me this: when the war ended, and you got news of what happened to all the Jews – I mean, how did you find out about the scope of the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1387">Were you still in Frankfurt?</span> <span id="s1388">How soon was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Well, the scope, of course we found out, I’m sure, when we started getting American news, and stuff like – you know, I worked for the military government, so already I knew a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s1390">But, you know, we knew there was Auschwitz, we knew that – I mean, I knew my girlfriend and her mother, I knew she’d gone to Theresienstadt, you know, so there wasn’t any secret about this.</span> <span id="s1391">And I knew people who had been deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1392">So, you know, I can understand, perhaps, that there were people who had no connection with Jews, that they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1393">You know, they maybe knew there was something going on, you know, but they weren’t really sure.</span> <span id="s1394">But, you know, I know – must have been 1934 – I was just telling the kids about this – my – it was an Easter vacation.</span> <span id="s1395">We took a – a trip to Unterfranken, you know, where Nuremberg is, and place like that.</span> <span id="s1396">And the first place we started – we went to, there was a sign about this wi – big at the entrance to the town.</span> <span id="s1397">Juden sind hier unavinst(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Jews are not wanted here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Yeah, and my mother was in the car, and so we turned around, and we did not go to Unterfranken, we went someplace else, we went to the Lake Constance instead, which was not in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s1400">So, you know, people just – just knew.</span> <span id="s1401">But you know, there was always anti-Semitism, and there always will be anti-Semitism, there’s no question in my mind.</span> <span id="s1402">I me –</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Why.</span> <span id="s1406">Why do you thi – why, in three parts.</span> <span id="s1407">Why do you think it always was?</span> <span id="s1408">Why do you think it always will be, and why is it not a question in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Well, Jews have always been persecuted.</span> <span id="s1410">I think part of it is that many of them are very successful, which people never like.</span> <span id="s1411">And – you know, and they have tended to be – well, they were moneychangers because that was the only pir – trade they were allowed to be.</span> <span id="s1412">And so they have their hand in the till.</span> <span id="s1413">And people didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s1414">You know, all you need to do is read Shakespeare, and they were always wandering everywhere.</span> <span id="s1415">I mean, you look at the entire history of Jews, they were enslaved, and they were evicted.</span> <span id="s1416">The – and they were in Germany for a while treated very well, then they became not treated well, they were all put in the ghetto, then that went.</span> <span id="s1417">So th – and this went o – there will always be people who – who are anti-Semitic, and there are today.</span> <span id="s1418">And you know, I know, when I was living with my mother in England, I had this – I knew all these girls from the friend – from the school in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1419">And this one girl asked me frequently to – for a weekend to her house.</span> <span id="s1420">And she said, we’ll go and play Bridge with these old ladies.</span> <span id="s1421">So, we went.</span> <span id="s1422">And of course, nobody knew who I was.</span> <span id="s1423">And this one lady said, well, you know, we’re taking in so many Jews.</span> <span id="s1424">I don’t really like them.</span> <span id="s1425">I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1426">I mean, what can you say?</span> <span id="s1427">But you know, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: And – and that is true in the entire world, and – and it will always be that way.</span> <span id="s1430">And you know, and it – first of all, people always have to have somebody they can hate.</span> <span id="s1431">You know, if it’s not the Jews here, it was the blacks for a long time.</span> <span id="s1432">That’s gotten a little better, but anythi – I mean, you know – fortunately the Holocaust Museum has made no bones about the fact that America was not very good during the war, and didn’t take in too many Jews, and all of that, you know.</span> <span id="s1433">I – I was very pleased to see that; it – it’s a good exhibit.</span> <span id="s1434">I’ve been through twice.</span> <span id="s1435">But it’s – it’ll always be that way.</span> <span id="s1436">But you know, I guess it’s the fate of Jews, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1437">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: It’s kind of sad.</span> <span id="s1439">I mean wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: You know, when I got my – when I married – when I wa – started going with my husband and I married him, our maid, who I told you about, so fond of the family, she said to me, don’t marry a Jew.</span> <span id="s1441">And I said why not?</span> <span id="s1442">And she said, always means trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1444">And I’m sure she meant it for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Oh yeah, I me –</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: – out of protection, a sense of protection –</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I mean, she had nothing against them in general, she just felt, don’t buy trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1449">I want to turn this around in a certain way, because you have a relationship still with Germany that many don’t.</span> <span id="s1450">I mean, I – it starts from when Steve and I, let’s say, we met in Bosch, he had very close relations with – with – I mean, his wife is German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: And you still go back.</span> <span id="s1453">And so many people who experienced any part of the Holocaust said never again.</span> <span id="s1454">I do not want to see this country again.</span> <span id="s1455">I do not want to know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: I wa – no, I’m not one who beared the grudge easily.</span> <span id="s1457">As I said to you, my nieces and my nephew live over there.</span> <span id="s1458">I still have friends over there.</span> <span id="s1459">And, you know, it’s the country where I was born, and where I’m from.</span> <span id="s1460">And you know, it was a horrible time, but it’s gone.</span> <span id="s1461">And I – I would not put it past any country to experience things like that.</span> <span id="s1462">I mean, you know, fortunately, this country is so big, that it’s almost impossible to have anything like that happen.</span> <span id="s1463">But think about Huey Long and Louisiana, which wasn’t a sterling experience.</span> <span id="s1464">And you know, think about Selma, Alabama.</span> <span id="s1465">There are many things in this country that happened, and it can ha – I mean, it goo – okay, it didn’t happen with the Jews, but it certainly happened with the blacks.</span> <span id="s1466">And now there is much resentment against Latinos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Yes, there is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: So, you know, I am not putting it past any country.</span> <span id="s1469">I mean, th – it was a little extreme in Germany, and you know, you don’t – I mean Hitler was just a wa – was a – you came – you know, every day, if you want to, you can watch on TV, they always have stuff about this, which I don’t watch.</span> <span id="s1470">But you know, basically, it’s where I’m from, and I don’t see any reason to give that up.</span> <span id="s1471">I mean, you can look around here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Yeah, there’s Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1473">There’s Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: You know, it – there’s Frankfurt, everywhere is Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1475">And you know, it’s my hometown.</span> <span id="s1476">So, you know, it was a horrible 12 - 13 years, but it’s gone.</span> <span id="s1477">And you know, okay, my family is – is scattered, and my life is different, and I did not get to study medicine, which is what I really wanted.</span> <span id="s1478">I did get a degree in bacteriology from the University of Arizona.</span> <span id="s1479">But here I’ve dealt in so – planning and so on, and – so, you know, your life takes a different –</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: – route, at times, and I don’t regret any of it.</span> <span id="s1482">I mean, I’m sorry I didn’t get to be an M.D., that’s what I would have liked, but you know, it’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Your – I think we’re coming close to the end.</span> <span id="s1484">I just wanted to take a few last words and ask you about your husband.</span> <span id="s1485">He was a Holocaust survivor as well, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Well, I’ll tell you; that’s what my nephew claims.</span> <span id="s1487">My husband was very into the – I wish you could have interviewed him, but he’s been dead 40 years, so it’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: He came to this country at the very last minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: That would mean which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: August ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: That is the last minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1494">I think he was on that Bremen that I didn’t get onto.</span> <span id="s1495">Now, he – it ba – it’s very interesting, his mother died when he was 11.</span> <span id="s1496">His father was a lawyer in a small town, in Flaybish(ph) gemund(ph), and I think his father was incapable of having this – of doing anything with the family, you know, he – he had these two boys, my husband and his older brother, who was, I think, five years older.</span> <span id="s1497">And, so when my husband was, I think – first of all, his father and his mother were in a concentration camp for a week.</span> <span id="s1498">You know, was one of the – maybe Kristallnacht, I’m not sure when – my husband happened to be in the hospital having his tonsils out at that point, which is why he was taken.</span> <span id="s1499">But, in any case, they sent him to Gross-Rosen, which is in Schlesien, where they had a farm for kids who wanted to emigrate.</span> <span id="s1500">It was specifically geared to that.</span> <span id="s1501">And all the kids who went there, did emigrate.</span> <span id="s1502">Now, my husband was clearly one of the youngest, because in 1939, he was only 18, and – and he – and they sent him there, I think, when he was 16, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1503">So he learned this farming, which is not what he really liked, but it was the only way to get here.</span> <span id="s1504">And then he did get a visa.</span> <span id="s1505">Now, there was a – and I don’t know how much you know about this: there was a family in Richmond, the Tarnheimers(ph), which had a big department store.</span> <span id="s1506">And they had a farm near Richmond, which was called Hyde(ph) Farmland, which they established precisely for these kids.</span> <span id="s1507">And that’s where my husband –</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: – got a visa for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: So he came – his brother was already in New York, but he came at the very last minute, in 1939, and went to that farm, Hyde(ph) Farmland, which, unfortunately was run only by those kids, who didn’t really know much about farming, and it went – well, about eight months after my husband got there.</span> <span id="s1512">And at that point, of course, there were all these kids, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: What do you do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Well, the Quakers in Philadelphia came through, and my husband went to Philadelphia and was housed with some Quaker family, I don’t know who they were, on the Main Line.</span> <span id="s1515">And he drove a milk truck.</span> <span id="s1516">As he always told me, the tips he got, he used to buy a radio.</span> <span id="s1517">And so he drove a milk truck for a while, a year or so, and then he got a job with a woman called Mrs. Summerall(ph), who had a nursery in Media, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1518">And he also – she had a room where he could sleep.</span> <span id="s1519">And she really loved him.</span> <span id="s1520">And she said – she said to me later too, I always said to him, if your hands were as good as your mind, then you would make a good [indecipherable] but your hands are not as good –</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: As your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1523">And he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: What a sweet way of putting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: And – but she kept him, and even though he wasn’t really very good.</span> <span id="s1526">I mean, it was just not him to – to be working the earth.</span> <span id="s1527">But he saved enough money to go to Penn State, of ill repute.</span> <span id="s1528">Well, my – Steven’s son just graduated from Penn State last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Let me make a point at this point of the interview, we’re talking about a current news item, in November 2011, about a scandal at Penn State, dealing with the football team.</span> <span id="s1530">By the time somebody would hear this in the future, that scandal will be long gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1533">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: So anyway, he saved enough money to go to Penn State, and he had thought he had saved enough money for four years, but he didn’t realize that as a non-citizen, he had to pay out-of-state tuition.</span> <span id="s1535">So the money lasted for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Oh, the poor man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: And, of course, it was a working – stuff.</span> <span id="s1538">I mean, he worked in the, I don’t know, cafeteria or something.</span> <span id="s1539">But fortunately, by now it was the end – early ’42, and he got drafted.</span> <span id="s1540">And one thing I have never understood in this country lately, is when he was drafted, they naturalized him.</span> <span id="s1541">They naturalized all the boys right away.</span> <span id="s1542">Now how we can have all these kids now in the military who are not citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: It’s very strange, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: I just don’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: I mean, I just don’t understand why they don’t naturalize those kids, who are good enough to serve in the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: And die for the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yeah, so I don’t – I – that I don’t understand, because I know that my husband was naturalized, I – I can’t remember what the – it was in New Jersey in some fort, whatever the name of it is.</span> <span id="s1549">So anyway, he was – he was naturalized, and then they sent him to Champagne, to learn more German.</span> <span id="s1550">But he – he was assigned to some infantry and then to the military government, was all, you know.</span> <span id="s1551">Anyway, it wasn’t the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1552">But I think – you know, it was very interesting that he was able to have this experience in Gross-Rosen, which he hated, but you know, nevertheless, it gave him the chance to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: And I was told that somebody had made an exhibit of this Gross-Rosen –</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: – experience, which was exhibited at Rutgers University, and I always thought the Holocaust Museum should get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Wa – wa – I will ask about it, you know, I will ask, because I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: My – my daughter Marli(ph) knows who the guy is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Because whe-when the – my nephew in New York, my brother-in-law’s son, he saw the exhibit at Rutgers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: And he wrote us, or called us and said, you know, I saw a picture of my husband in Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1563">I have those pictures.</span> <span id="s1564">And – and then my daughter got in touch with the guy who – who has that – put that exhibit together, and then it was somewhere in New Jersey, more towards the coast, I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s1565">And we were gonna go and see it, and then there was snow and we couldn’t go and see it, but in any case, I don’t know where it is now.</span> <span id="s1566">But, you know, it’s an interesting thing, because that was established –</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Well it – yes, very little known.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: – and a lot of the kids, I think, went to South America from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: But quite a few came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: And he went back to Germany then as part of the U.S. military?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1573">He – he was sent to – I don’t know, hi – first to England, I think, and then he came over, he was – he was in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge, but, you know, he was not fighting, he – he was just there, and – and he said it was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1574">I’m sure it was.</span> <span id="s1575">And then he – then he wa – actually, I met him when he was discharged, because, you know, a lot of G.I.s took a discharge in Europe and then took a contract with what was then called the war department.</span> <span id="s1576">And he had a contract with the war department to work at the military government in denazification, and I happened to be in that department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: And that’s how you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: And he took my desk, and I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s1579">But, you know, that’s an old story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: That – that – that’s all we needed, this guy here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1583">So your children at least know how their parents met –</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Yes, they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: – even if you don’t know how your parents met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Yeah, they do – they do know.</span> <span id="s1587">We met at the military government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yeah, it’s such a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1591">Is there anything that you think we haven’t talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: I think –</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Is there anything that you’d want to add about let’s say, the new da – denazification department?</span> <span id="s1594">Or do you think we pretty much covered it?</span> <span id="s1595">Your dog is impatient, she wants some attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Well, it was interesting to work at the military government, you know.</span> <span id="s1597">I’ve worked first [indecipherable] I worked first in a different department.</span> <span id="s1598">When we were first hired – I mean, was right away.</span> <span id="s1599">I mean, as I told you, my father –</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: That’s right, was asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: – was there, and I said, let’s see if we can’t – if I can’t get there, because I wasn’t going back to that doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: The one you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1604">And so he said yes, yes, yes, they said come and see, and so I was hired right away, and with another girl whom I didn’t know, but whom I met.</span> <span id="s1605">And then, just as the war ended, they fired us all, because they got Belgian girls, who were, of course, allies, and so all German girls were fired, and four weeks later they go and hired us back, because the Belgian girls, they didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1606">So, you know, I was home for four weeks and then they – they called and said, would I come back, you know.</span> <span id="s1607">So I went back, and I worked first in supply, which was very interesting because the sergeant in supply, his name was Valna(ph) Hirschman(ph), and he was from Frankfurt, which he didn’t really want to tell y – tell you.</span> <span id="s1608">But he was – he was a nice guy, I mean, and we – we worked mostly in the warehouse, where they had, you know, staples of supplies, like food and stuff, and rats, too.</span> <span id="s1609">But he was very nice, because every Friday, he gave us a package, a care package to take home.</span> <span id="s1610">And believe me, the time right after the war was the most difficult one, as far as food and – and heating goes.</span> <span id="s1611">I mean, there wasn’t any food, and there was no coal to heat.</span> <span id="s1612">So it was – fortunately [indecipherable] the military government, and met somebody who had coal, so we were able to get some coal, but it – the food was really very, very short, and I got lunch every day at the military government.</span> <span id="s1613">They had a canteen and they fed all of us.</span> <span id="s1614">Lot of creamed corn, and – but that’s okay, I mean – and Spam.</span> <span id="s1615">But, you know, when you’re hungry, you’re happy to eat anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: So I worked there in supply for quite a long time and – and I also went with this one sergeant; he had to inspect all the boats on the Main river.</span> <span id="s1618">So we went – I – I always remember, we had a very nice trip, he was a nice guy, I really enjoyed him.</span> <span id="s1619">And once we went someplace to inspect the boat, and we came to a military sentry or something, and he said, she’s my interpreter.</span> <span id="s1620">And they said, and if they were Jesus Christ you couldn’t get – you couldn’t take her in.</span> <span id="s1621">It was some secret stuff, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: – so we had to go someplace else.</span> <span id="s1624">And then, after that I was transferred to the denazification.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: At – the same thing – in the same building, but it was different department.</span> <span id="s1627">And I worked for a Captain Morrison, who gave me a very good reference, that I was very good in shor – good in shorthand, and I never ha – knew shorthand, but that’s all right, I had a good memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: And then Morrison left and my husband came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: And what was your job there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: It was mainly translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: And translation of interviews, or translation of documents, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: Translation of documents, and – no, not interviews, I didn’t do any interviews.</span> <span id="s1634">It was mainly documents and – and writing letters, and you know, secretarial stuff type – thing.</span> <span id="s1635">So, it was – I can’t remember why I didn’t apply, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: It’s a good place to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: It was a very good place to be.</span> <span id="s1638">It was a very good pla – and I met – met a lot of G.I.s, and I had a very good time, is all I can say.</span> <span id="s1639">But, you know, it was enjoyable.</span> <span id="s1640">And it was like we – it was the first time I heard a lot of amer – new American music, which I didn’t know, you know, never heard of Glenn Miller before, but then all of a sudden, all that came back.</span> <span id="s1641">That was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: And I left in ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Were you e – married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: I came here in ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Were you married then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: No.</span> <span id="s1648">I came here in ’47 on a visa.</span> <span id="s1649">My mother gave me the affidavit, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: And I came here ostensibly to go live with my mother, but I knew I was getting married, so – my husband was – his contract was – I came the first of May, and his contract wasn’t up til July.</span> <span id="s1652">So he came later, and I’ll tell you, I – I left Frankfurt on the first of May and flew directly to two – I mean, I spent one night in New York, and then went on to Tucson in a fur coat, and it was a hundred and five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Oh my, oh my, oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: And I – and I didn’t think I was gonna live through that summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: But I si – we stayed there seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: You get used to places, no matter how different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Actually I – I really loved Arizona.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Did you?</span> <span id="s1660">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: And then we lived in California for six years, and I would never go back to California.</span> <span id="s1662">But I loved – I really liked Arizona.</span> <span id="s1663">It grows on you, you know, and so I really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1664">But you know, I – we stayed there because he went to law school there, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Well, I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Well, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Thank you so much for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: – it was fine, and if my kids ever want to hear this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: We’re going to give you a copy – send you a copy for exactly that purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: And then your – and hopefully they will find it of interest, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: I hope so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: – but you never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Well, I think they will.</span> <span id="s1676">I think they will.</span> <span id="s1677">I think you have a lot of insight –</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Now, when is the la –
