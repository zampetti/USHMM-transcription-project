It wasn't at all however.</span> <span id="s47">There came the village or town or whatever you want to call it, of Dachau, and there we found that twirling barbed wire fence, and there was a moat and over the moat there was a bridge, But the bridge was permanent, it was not a draw-up bridge, but I was sure now that it was well secured, that they just didn't want people to get out of there, alive.</span> <span id="s48">If it had been a concentration camp--and maybe it was--but by the time I got there to my experience it was purely and simply a camp to kill people.</span> <span id="s49">I did not however, go into throughout the thing to learn if there were reasons, such as you mentioned, that maybe there were some very serious medical practices performed there, to see how long a body could withstand ice-cold water or whatever.</span> <span id="s50">The people that had been running the camp were already gone.</span> <span id="s51">I think they knew that the war was over and they were just waiting... and it did end the following month.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So you came up to the wire...</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Oh yes, we barged against the wire, blew it up, the sparks flew like mad because it was electrified and...</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Did it seem like this was the main entrance into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, I didn't, but a couple of my guys did.</span> <span id="s56">.</span> <span id="s57">They went into one of the ... or the least they came back and told me there was a shower place in there that wasn't connected to water at all, but was connected to poisoning gas and…</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did they see any bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I got sick.</span> <span id="s60">I didn't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s61">We were very close as guys and they said "Let's go!"</span> <span id="s62">and asked: "Will we tell the other guys?"</span> <span id="s63">and I said:"We will eventually, but let's just roll away, because we have got to communicate back."</span> <span id="s64">So actually I just didn't communicate that I had been in Dachau.</span> <span id="s65">When we came back about a month later a couple of guys went on up and it was already being prepared to be a memorial to ... I don't know, a memorial to hate or whether it's a memorial to... it's a fun place to have a memorial ... perhaps to have people understand the complications that those who were destroyed there had... If it stand as a memento of how bad human can be if for whatever reason driven to it.</span> <span id="s66">I suppose it is something that has a value... personally I would say destroy it, because it is just too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Going back to the time when you were there: These bodies that you saw, they were on gallows?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Oh yes, They were dead, we cut them down.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Were they mutilated in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: It looked like they had been stabbed a couple of times.</span> <span id="s71">But there were about five to six Polish POW's with the striped trousers and so on, and I had this young chap, this Jewish chap, that was in my platoon and he was able to understand a lot of their conversation.</span> <span id="s72">They asked me for weapons, so I gave them some.</span> <span id="s73">They were very happy that we showed up, because it was hard to distinguish between German- and American helmets.</span> <span id="s74">If I was going to be the first American you saw, you wouldn't be sure that I wasn't a German, because their helmets were shaped almost like ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: So did they, the inmates, at first run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: No, didn't.</span> <span id="s77">They came creeping out.</span> <span id="s78">These guys were rather...they were pretty brave people.</span> <span id="s79">They knew that if we blew up that fence...they knew I was on the different side than the guys that had put it up, but whether they could tell...I imagine they knew we were Americans...It was just a devastation experience even though I didn't go in but I could see the ovens.</span> <span id="s80">They were cooking...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So that was ...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: That was where the smell came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And there was smoking pouring out?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Oh sure, Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: How far away would you say, where these ovens.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: From the entrance?</span> <span id="s87">Not too far, I'd say a couple of hundred yards, maybe ... and the other thing was that everything was inside this moat and this barbed wire, I just don't know much about it.</span> <span id="s88">I was there, yes, in my opinion, what little I saw was evidence that there were devastating things going on there before I got there.</span> <span id="s89">But you can't blame all the civilians in that community.</span> <span id="s90">I don't even know if you can't blame all the civilians in that community.</span> <span id="s91">I don't even know if you can blame all the German civilians, but this little nucleus of the SS and the Swastika-group and the...I think we ought to learn from it, that we - if you can learn this much - we must be very careful of the outlandish groups that have strong ways of making their own law, and essentially, I think it needs good review for some stupid people that we are doing some rather catastrophic things to groups of people who can't defend themselves and they very quickly go free later and start all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did you ever speak to any German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Oh yes, well I had an interpreter.</span> <span id="s94">I went into Mossbach and became the information and Education Officer for that battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And because you stayed there in capacity you talked to some of the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: To a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Did you ever ask them about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Oh sure, but Auschwitz was the one that got most of the publicity.</span> <span id="s99">I think it (Auschwitz) was more of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s100">That's what Egon Tien, my interpreter, told me, who was captured in France and then I got him.</span> <span id="s101">(German POW assigned to Mr. Mullholland.)</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So what did the German civilians say about the camp?</span> <span id="s103">What was their...</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I must say that I'm not so sure... it was never publicized, obviously... I'm not so sure that there was a high percentage of the German people other than maybe the educated, who were the more affluent, who maybe had to be involved somewhat in the politics of the country at the time in order to...For the purpose of self preservation.</span> <span id="s105">I imagine they knew.</span> <span id="s106">I was not aware of Auschwitz, I was not aware of the northern concentration camps, I was never aware of the Polish concentration-camps: you know, the Ghetto on Poland, in Warsaw I believe.</span> <span id="s107">I had to read about that when I came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: The men that went with you into the camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: The four...</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Yes, the four, what were their reactions and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Very violent, one of them opened the door to the shower-room, to what looked like the shower-room, but you could see the gas-jets.</span> <span id="s112">There weren't any people in there.</span> <span id="s113">One of them said that the ovens were working.</span> <span id="s114">I have to presume that he opened the door.</span> <span id="s115">It was strictly a high-pressure gas.</span> <span id="s116">It was an instant situation, there was no further torture, if there had been any torture.</span> <span id="s117">It was just revolting to think about, and I was only 25 years old and that's not all that old to stumble on that kind of garbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Did you ever ... you said that you had decided that you weren't going to communicate with the other members of the platoon...</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: But I did though...</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Oh, you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Oh yes, I had to.</span> <span id="s122">I felt that maybe more qualified people should take a look at a thing like that and I wasn't qualified to make a judgment as to what had gone on there and so I just told the platoon leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: And when were you shipped back to the US?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: After I had been in Europe for 30 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: When you came back, did you talk about what you had seen at Dachau with anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No, not until now.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Why was it that you didn't talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I suppose for one I didn't understand it too well, also it's one of those things that I'd rather forget, to be honest.</span> <span id="s129">I'm sure a lot of the people, not only in Dachau, but in whatever community in the wide area is called, they want to forget it, not because - I don't want to say it didn't exist, but if you keep worrying about those atrocities it can affect you emotionally.</span> <span id="s130">I believe it did affect me emotionally.</span> <span id="s131">I was sent for rest and rehabilitation to a skiing lodge.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And you think that part of that might have been what you saw in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Sure, absolutely.</span> <span id="s134">I went down to Olbiach and skied for almost a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Why then do you think that now you were interested in at least discussing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I don't mind discussing it.</span> <span id="s137">It's far enough behind me.</span> <span id="s138">If this helps to possibly remove that hazard even in the remotest possibility in the future, then fine, if it just makes people more upset, then I would not be interested in being here.</span> <span id="s139">I watched "The Day After" and I stood in Germany, when this country popped off two atomic bombs.</span> <span id="s140">Even more than this, what upset me the most is to see the further part of it, the majority size of the army on both sides are very young people.</span> <span id="s141">I'm a boxing-fan and I know that not everybody knows how to defend themselves.</span> <span id="s142">And if a country can learn how to defend ... if they see a thing like this going on in their country - I don't care whether it's in Africa or where it is - blow it up!</span> <span id="s143">Hopefully it's empty, but blow it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: To get rid of that evil, of the ...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: People.</span> <span id="s146">It's a very, very evil thing for any community, let alone a country, to think that they have a right to manipulate your body, and for no cause to eliminate it, your life.</span> <span id="s147">Maybe this is my own catholic training, I went to a Catholic Grammar school and High-school, or it is just the Christian part of it.</span> <span id="s148">I say blow it up.</span> <span id="s149">If I would go back to Germany on a holiday I wouldn't go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s150">I would go to Munich or Heidelberg, but to Dachau no possibility.</span> <span id="s151">That may disagree with what you want to hear for...</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: No, not at all, because you know, there are different ways of looking at it.</span> <span id="s153">I think the fact that they made it into a memorial is... you know, they wanted to caution future generations.</span> <span id="s154">Want to show them what people can do...</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, my way is not really that way.</span> <span id="s156">I would say that...there's got to be a couple of old SS troopers hanging around that go:"Hey, there's my kind of place...".</span> <span id="s157">It's so barbaric, it has to remind you…Why is the Coliseum in Rome?</span> <span id="s158">Now maybe it is a memorial to the way Christians were used in sport, maybe if I had a say I'd go to Rome and blow it up.</span> <span id="s159">You see I don't consider it a memorial to something honorable and that's what... but then I'm not qualified to seriously disagree with you.</span> <span id="s160">I haven't studied it enough.</span> <span id="s161">I have raised my four children to be Christians and I presume that regardless of your faith, that your approach to your family-life is what we would call Christian, and you know, just don't shoot the other guy just because you feel like shooting somebody, and I can't say much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: I think that what you said before about remembering this to hopefully prevent something like this from happening again...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: It's the only reason I'm here.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: That's really why were doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">USHMM Archives RG-50.031*0048 PAGE 6</span></p></body></html>
