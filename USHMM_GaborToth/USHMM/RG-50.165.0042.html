farmers.</span> <span id="s46">And the Gentile people lived around the town.</span> <span id="s47">It was built like a ghetto.</span> <span id="s48">The Jewish people were always together.</span></p>

where were you?</span> <span id="s52">I mean this is a short question with a big answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">SH: I’ll try to explain the best I can.</span> <span id="s54">The war start 1939...a pact divided Poland into two halves.</span> <span id="s55">The Western part of Poland became Germany, and the Eastern part of Poland, Russia took.</span> <span id="s56">Russian stood in the Eastern part from ’39 until ’41.</span> <span id="s57">We were in the Eastern side and therefore we had from until 1941 we lived with the Russian people.</span> <span id="s58">The Russian people took away the businesses from the Jewish people and I was at that time 19 years old...we didn’t have our business, but people still made a living.</span> <span id="s59">Some very wealthy people started to suffer, they took some even to Siberia.</span> <span id="s60">But they didn’t kill people.</span> <span id="s61">They took away their stores, some of them lost their houses...but the middle class people were able to stay at home, and we weren’t rich, we were middle class, my brothers and I had jobs and we worked until the war broke out between Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s62">In June, ’41 the war broke out and there, were –really we start to feel the war.</span> <span id="s63">The first day they came into our town they took out 36 Jews!</span> <span id="s64">Not question, ‘Why?’</span> <span id="s65">Not giving any reason why they killed in town, 36 Jews on the day they came to Chorostkow.</span> <span id="s66">Most of them were close friends...killed good friends...when the Ukrainian people took over...and worked with the Germans...some boys start to ride to town and they called every Jew should come to the town hall.</span> <span id="s67">And many, many went.</span> <span id="s68">Luckily, my mother (lavshulim?)</span> <span id="s69">was a very smart lady.</span> <span id="s70">She said, ‘wait let’s see’ and my brother and I, we went to the attic and instead to go, we start to hide, and we only looked through and we were able to see where people are going, voluntarily to the town hall.</span> <span id="s71">They surrounded them...and they start to beat them tremendous...and murder them...and they wanted to kill everybody.</span> <span id="s72">Luckily, that time...the Ukrainian mayor...he said, ‘You can beat up the Jews but as long as I’m mayor, I wouldn’t let you kill them.’</span> <span id="s73">...later on they organized a Judenrat in town.</span> <span id="s74">And the purpose was suppose to be in the Judenrat to organize how to manage, food to come in, the Germans would need workers...nobody thought they going to ask people to go to concentration camp in the beginning or even to go to be killed...I remember, they came to our house and I was that time, 21 years old, my brother, (zey geizehunt?)</span> <span id="s75">was 23 years, and they ask us to join the... Judenrat.</span> <span id="s76">I questioned what will be my job...He said, ‘You’ll have to bring people to go to work for the Germans.’</span> <span id="s77">I said, ‘I’m gonna go and call my dear friends and tell them, ‘you go to work and I’m gonna stay here?</span> <span id="s78">I don’t want it!</span> <span id="s79">I would rather go to work for myself!’</span> <span id="s80">And, of course, we didn’t accept it.</span> <span id="s81">But other people did accept it...in our town...Jews had to stay only in the center and forbid us to deal with the Gentile people...Jewish people couldn’t go on the market, they couldn’t deal with Gentiles at all...about two weeks before Rosh Hashana, that time they came to the Judenrat and they told the Judenrat they wanted 200 boys to go to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s82">Supposedly it was suppose to be for 3 months work.</span> <span id="s83">The Judenrat delivered them.</span> <span id="s84">They came to us, and the last minute...my father had a friend in the Judenrat...and he told my father the only way if you wanna your sons shouldn’t go to concentration camp, you have to let them work...(0n) a big farm which the Germans took over...he also said, ‘Look, in order to do this, you gotta pay for this.’</span> <span id="s85">Not for him (?</span> <span id="s86">chasvelaleh) but he had to give some other people.</span> <span id="s87">And whatever my father had he paid and at that time we were able –we start to work on the farm, and we did not go...that time in the concentration camp...we worked...very hard...but at least I was able to come home at night to sleep in our house, until March 19, 1942...a group of Jewish boys...and that day, March 19, they called, ‘Everybody must go to clean up the road from the city of Chorostkow to the station’...there was a lot of snow they said they wanted to open up the road...we knew that we have to work because this was the occupation of the Germans, so we went.</span> <span id="s88">Had we know where we were going, of course we would have run away.</span> <span id="s89">And we, when we came there we were 84 boys from Chorostkow, we were there 10-15 minutes working on the snow, all of a sudden we notice we were surrounded by Ukrainian police...and they tell us to run towards the next city...more Jews came and together we became already a group of maybe three, four hundred...we had to run very fast.</span> <span id="s90">Whoever couldn’t, got a beating or he was shot...the same day, in the evening, we came to...jail.</span> <span id="s91">March 19, 1942...in order to count us, everybody had to get a very good punch with a strong stick over his head...everybody came in, most of us got wounded, bleeded...every day they used to count us on the same way by beating, with no food, no water for three days... they put us in a small rooms...we were 60-80 people and there was no place where to sit down and to lay down.</span> <span id="s92">We only stood.</span> <span id="s93">Most of us thought that this is gonna be our end...March 22nd, they took us out...gave everybody a little piece of bread and a little bit of water...there were wagons prepared...cattle wagons...we were probably about 500 boys that time.</span> <span id="s94">They locked the wagons, and we didn’t know where we going.</span> <span id="s95">People tried to jump, but we couldn’t because there was no windows...they took us to a concentration camp (Kamuncka?)</span> <span id="s96">...this should take with a train in a normal way, three to four hours.</span> <span id="s97">It took us 18 hours, and we came to Kamuncka?</span> <span id="s98">...there was already in existence, a camp.</span> <span id="s99">There were Jewish people already from before....they had a small percentage of non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s100">The non-Jewish people had a red piece of cloth, square, we Jewish people, everybody got a yellow –some has a star –some had just a yellow piece of cloth in the front and the back.</span> <span id="s101">When we came there, and-there-there we, was, something which is terrible to describe.</span> <span id="s102">The conditions.</span> <span id="s103">No food, no place where to sleep, they pushed us in 3...(to) a bunk.</span> <span id="s104">And one little room this must be, 50-60...there was no food and cold and no sanitary –toilets and no way where to wash.</span> <span id="s105">For three months we didn’t get any water at all to wash...we drill a well and we were able to get some water to wash...they took us right away the next day to work cleaning the snow...to help to build the road...the yelling, and the holloring, the the beating, and the smell from the dead people which they were killing.</span> <span id="s106">It was so terribly –us, we thought we’ll never get out.</span> <span id="s107">And very few did get out.</span> <span id="s108">I was in this camp for 16 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">WH: And you thought, throughout that time -.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">SH: I came in March.</span> <span id="s111">It was a few weeks before Pesach.</span> <span id="s112">Pesach I still didn’t want to eat any bread.</span> <span id="s113">And there was no matzoh.</span> <span id="s114">I eat, I remember –and there was very little food, anyhow –but I was able to get a potato, so I didn’t have to eat any bread...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">WH: Who were the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SH: The guards was Ukrainian guards, but the Germans used to come every day to check us.</span> <span id="s117">In the beginning I worked very hard...everybody got beatings, but I was young and strong and I made up my mind the only way is maybe to live through the war, if I’ll be recognized as a good worker.</span> <span id="s118">Which I did.</span> <span id="s119">I worked very hard, a few of us.</span> <span id="s120">This helped a little bit sympathy some of them had for a good worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WH: Did you lose hope during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">SH: I hoped always to live through, however, I was very, very much concerned...Hitler was in 33 months...he managed in the 33 months, to do such a fast job of every day, every day they were killing men, women, young, and old, children.</span> <span id="s123">And many times I was worrying and concerned who KNOWS whether somebody’s going to be alive to tell the story.</span> <span id="s124">Not thinking that, thank G-d, in 1988 you gonna come to my house in America and I’ll be able to tell you the story and for this alone I should make a sheheheyanu.</span> <span id="s125">However, this is facts.</span> <span id="s126">We did not believe that somebody is going to be alive.</span> <span id="s127">I saw stories in concentration camps midt, I don’t think as not only Jewish people, I don’t think any people ever want beating, shooting, hunger, cold, this was life.</span> <span id="s128">(His voice drops to a whisper.)</span> <span id="s129">...after concentration camp...many people were able to be brought out...in the meantime, there’s a very important story I’d like to tell you.</span> <span id="s130">It was the first day of Succoth in 1942...they came to our hometown... I was that time in concentration camp...they kill and beat up Jews, and the most of them they took to the railroad station...among them was my father and they took them to Belzec.</span> <span id="s131">Belzec is one of the death camps where over 600,000 Jews were killed immediately.</span> <span id="s132">They didn’t even let them work.</span> <span id="s133">This is fact.</span> <span id="s134">I was several times in Belzec checking, discussing with people, books about Belzec.</span> <span id="s135">Belzec, although it not being mentioned as much as Maidanek, or Auschwitz, or Treblinka, however, it was one of the toughest, it may be THE toughest –because very few people came out.</span> <span id="s136">As a matter of fact, I think only ONE of the 600,000 was alive –one survived...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">(Note: Mr. Halpern today says: ...I go –I was there several times... my brother was several times there.</span> <span id="s138">We go there to say Kaddish...there is a monuments there.</span> <span id="s139">Several monuments.</span> <span id="s140">Six monuments in order to mention the 600,000.</span> <span id="s141">There’s one monument which says (in Polish-), this means, ‘On this spot Hitler killed 600,000 Jews and 1,500 non-Jews they helped Jews.’</span> <span id="s142">Most of the monuments in Poland, they say, ‘PEOPLE were killed’ but the fact there were JEWISH people who were killed.</span> <span id="s143">They don’t mention Jewish.</span> <span id="s144">They don’t.</span> <span id="s145">But in Belzec they do mention, because they did this right after the war in 1945, and that time there were still a group of Jewish people, they insist, and somehow ‘til date, the monument still stays.)</span></p> <p><span id="s146">SH: ...my mother and my brother paid in a lot of money, whatever they had to be able to get me out from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s147">But, they wouldn’t let me out because I still was in good condition, and...they start to liquidate ghettos day by day...1943, which means, about six months after my father was killed, they killed...they took out 1,000 Jews and this time they didn’t take them to Belzec, but they made them march through the city naked and outside the city...the big ditches were already prepared and everybody went to such a board, and they got a bullet.</span> <span id="s148">Whether he was alive, or not alive, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s149">And in one day, they killed that time over 1,000...my mother was that time killed...so my brother was by himself, so he voluntarily came already to my camp.</span> <span id="s150">And my brother and I were together in camp because there was no place where to go...the ghetto...two months later they came and they liquidated.</span> <span id="s151">They killed everybody...by us, in concentration camp we worked hard, but we were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WH: Your brother couldn’t have gone to the woods to hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">SH: Maybe he could, but he wanted to be with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">WH: He knew at least, he’s alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">SH: He is alive (inaudible).</span> <span id="s156">He came, and we know this can be only a temporary oasis, but every day what you can stay, there were no place to go...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WH: You were there for how much longer after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">SH: My brother came to me right after Pesach, and we were there ‘til July, 10th, 1943.</span> <span id="s159">This time they notice us, the Germans start to run the concentration camp...but, it was on a Friday night, we saw as many Germans and Ukrainians start to come closer, so a group of people, several hundred people, we were able to run away.</span> <span id="s160">We opened up the gate, from the other side, it was dark at night, and we were able to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">WH: You said a ‘few hundred’ ran away.</span> <span id="s162">How many were there in total in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">SH: ...must be about 4,000...</span></p> <p><span id="s164">WH: So, if you were in the group of a few hundred ran away, is this because you seized the opportunity or because you happened to be in the place where they were opening the gate?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">SH: Everybody was able to run away.</span> <span id="s166">This is something that is important to the story and should mark this down.</span> <span id="s167">It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s168">I’m glad you ask me.</span> <span id="s169">People know, us there’s gonna be they call this a ‘(axeia?)’</span> <span id="s170">How they gonna kill Jews.</span> <span id="s171">Yet most of them said, ‘Where they gonna run –there’s no place to go.’</span> <span id="s172">And they said, ‘Shema Yisrael’ and they they sitting there waiting –maybe they wouldn’t –maybe they will.</span> <span id="s173">Now I’m gonna tell you, I was even –I did not run away too far.</span> <span id="s174">I ran close enough, as I heard when there were –I couldn’t run too far, because I ran away at night, Friday night outside the barracks, and I fell asleep in the field, in such a high corn.</span> <span id="s175">And in the morning, I was woked up because I-I wasn’t sure if they gonna kill.</span> <span id="s176">I figured if they wouldn’t kill, I’ll go back.</span> <span id="s177">If they’ll kill, I’ll run away further.</span> <span id="s178">In the meantime I fall asleep, and the morning, 4 o’clock, or 4:30, I heard already shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">WH: So, you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">SH: I knew.</span> <span id="s181">There’s no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">WH: You were with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">SH: No.</span> <span id="s184">I was separate.</span> <span id="s185">And he was separate.</span> <span id="s186">We run away separate.</span> <span id="s187">I heard where they came around, the Germans, and they start to holler: eintratten los shnel!</span> <span id="s188">And start to beat them, and I already start to hear shooting.</span> <span id="s189">And I start to hear, people already, while holloring, and I just said, ‘lay down,’ and I said, ‘Shema Yisrael’ – and, this day, Shabbat, 7 days in Tammuz, 10 days in July 1943, this day was to me like a 100 years long.</span> <span id="s190">I heard where people were holloring, begging and they were shooting and this was going on all day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">WH: You didn’t move?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">SH: I didn’t move.</span> <span id="s193">Because they were shooting.</span> <span id="s194">And if I move, I’m definitely gonna to be killed.</span> <span id="s195">If a bullet will get me, (inaudible) but maybe they wouldn’t, and while there were shootings because many people were on the field.</span> <span id="s196">And some of them got hurt.</span> <span id="s197">Thank</span></p> <p><span id="s198">G-d, I didn’t get hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">WH: What happened at the end of the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">SH: Ten o’clock at night, when everything was quiet already, and it was dark, I just got up, checked myself out-</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: Make sure you’re still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">SH: I’ll still there!</span> <span id="s203">Nothing is missing.</span> <span id="s204">And I start to go, I felt I have to go back home, close to home.</span> <span id="s205">I came on one Ukrainian, and I want to find out what happened, because I only heard, and he told me that ‘EVERYBODY was killed’...I just decided that I have to go further and it took me three days, from Saturday night ‘til Tuesday night, until I came...to a Polish family...they used to come to our store and buy...</span></p> <p><span id="s206">WH: Would you say that your family was well-off?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">SH: We were middle class.</span> <span id="s208">We had parnoses.</span> <span id="s209">Children had enough money to read, to dress ourself.</span> <span id="s210">We weren’t wealthy.</span> <span id="s211">I was able, when I belonged to (inaudible) I was able to come in and pay our dues every month.</span> <span id="s212">And sometimes even pay for a friend, too, which a poor fellow didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s213">But, we were far not wealthy, we made a living.</span> <span id="s214">We had parnoses.</span> <span id="s215">And this was important an achievement, to make parnoses.</span> <span id="s216">And especial when the boys could work, we were three boys.</span> <span id="s217">Lately, one of our –my oldest brother –I mentioned before we were four, but in 1929 my oldest brother passed away...t.b. -...we were three boys, my brother Avuchaim, and my brother Harry, which now lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s218">With me, he’s my partner and my good friend.</span> <span id="s219">I’m very happy.</span> <span id="s220">Thank G-d I have him...when we grew up and helped my father in business, parnoses was already much more better.</span> <span id="s221">However, we still weren’t rich, we made a comfortable living.</span> <span id="s222">.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">WH: So you went to this family -.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">SH: I went to the family...and my brother was already there.</span> <span id="s225">He ran away and he came also the same day as I..</span> <span id="s226">.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">WH: Did you have an agreement that you would -.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">SH: I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s229">There was no discussion...this family used to do business.</span> <span id="s230">They used to come to our store and buy...I felt that this is a nice family.</span> <span id="s231">I may as well go to them.</span> <span id="s232">And my brother also felt the same way.</span> <span id="s233">My brother did not discuss.</span> <span id="s234">When I came at nighttime...July 13th, 1943, when the dogs start to bark...young Gorniak (Polish boy) came out, he didn’t see me for a long time...maybe three years.</span> <span id="s235">And he recognized me, and he didn’t talk to me (inaudible) showed me to go to the barn...and he showed me I should go up to the attic.</span> <span id="s236">Which I did.</span> <span id="s237">I was knocked out for three days.</span> <span id="s238">Very little food, and the raining, I slept outside, so I was knocked out, and here was fresh hay, and fresh straw.</span> <span id="s239">I said, ‘Heh, heh, (needs translation) whatever will be, will be.’</span> <span id="s240">In the meantime I will be able to rest a few days.</span> <span id="s241">And while I rested somebody start to talk to me in a quiet way, says, ‘Who is this?</span> <span id="s242">Who is this?’</span> <span id="s243">When he start to ask, I said, ‘Who is this?’</span> <span id="s244">And this was already my brother and we start to hug and kiss.</span> <span id="s245">We said, after such a terrible axia?</span> <span id="s246">We did not discuss where we gonna find each other.</span> <span id="s247">And we found each other right here, and we hope we gonna live through the war.</span> <span id="s248">About 10 or 15 minutes later, young Gorniak’s mother...she came up with fresh young potatoes, with sour cream, with borscht, corned?</span> <span id="s249">borscht, such a fine (inaudible).</span> <span id="s250">I didn’t eat this in concentration camp, I didn’t eat this in ghetto for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s251">And she start to kiss me, and hug me.</span> <span id="s252">She said, ‘Thank G-d you’re here.</span> <span id="s253">I promised your mother.</span> <span id="s254">My mother wasn’t alive.</span> <span id="s255">She said my mother ‘came to dream to me.</span> <span id="s256">And in a dream she asked I should save her the boys and I promised I’m gonna save her and I’m so glad you are able to come.’</span></p> <p><span id="s257">WH: Didn’t you think that there was something supernatural -?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">SH: I believe in G-d!</span> <span id="s259">I believe in G-d!</span> <span id="s260">...(inaudible) here a Gentile Polish lady goes over and kisses me and hugs me, and she says, ‘There’s a terrible war goes on.</span> <span id="s261">And we have to help each other.’</span> <span id="s262">I want you to know, those people kept us for 8 ½ months.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">WH: At the risk of their own lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">SH: They knew very well, that if we gonna be caught, we gonna give away their life.</span> <span id="s265">In order to save our life, we endangered their life.</span> <span id="s266">Because I have witnesses where other Jewish people were hidden by Pollacks, and when they were caught, they used to kill the Jews and the Pollacks, and they used to burn their farm.</span> <span id="s267">They kept us for 8 ½ months, they gave us food –better food than they ate themselves.</span> <span id="s268">They had a nice big farm...until Russian liberate us in March 22, 1944...we were liberated about 14 months before the war ended...what I did then?</span> <span id="s269">Then...Russia...made a mobilization, everybody from 18’til 54 must go in the army...in the meantime somebody told me that the director...from ’39 to ’41...I had a job...came back.</span> <span id="s270">I didn’t have nothing what to loose.</span> <span id="s271">I wasn’t too anxious to go to the army...so I felt I’m gonna go to him.</span> <span id="s272">I came in to him...he saw me, he started, he hugged me, he kissed me...he says, ‘It’s good you are alive’ (in Polish) What’s you’re doing?’</span> <span id="s273">So I told him tomorrow I have to go to the army...he wrote on a piece of paper, he says, ‘from tomorrow on, you are the Director’...from this and this factory.</span> <span id="s274">Now I can tell you this job it was recognized that time so important like Kissinger’s job is, was like Secretary of States.</span> <span id="s275">Because not only I didn’t have to go to the army, but I became (anacharnik?</span> <span id="s276">director) over a factory which had over 100 people.</span> <span id="s277">I had a right to pick people he should work in the factory...(which made) spirits...rubber tires...I worked there until May, 1945, the war end, and a law came out that anybody who was born in Poland can’t leave Russia and go to Poland...I did not want to stay in Russia I put in an application to my director...that I want to leave this job and go to Poland.</span> <span id="s278">When I gave him this application, he tore it.</span> <span id="s279">He says, ‘...why do you want to go to Poland?’</span> <span id="s280">So I told him the truth.</span> <span id="s281">I’m not gonna go to Poland to stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s282">But here most of the family is killed and I cannot stay here but I have already that time a card from my uncle in America.</span> <span id="s283">I told him I have an uncle in America, and I want to go to Poland, through Poland to America.</span> <span id="s284">The prestige from America was always great in Russia.</span> <span id="s285">He personally loved very much America.</span> <span id="s286">And he released me.</span> <span id="s287">And after two weeks I left my position in Russia and I went to Poland...right away I started a business.</span> <span id="s288">We opened up a business, my brother and I..</span> <span id="s289">.</span> <span id="s290">Hitler was very lucky to me personally I was able to meet my lovely wife in ?</span> <span id="s291">Mittland?</span> <span id="s292">and we start to go out, and we start to make plans.</span> <span id="s293">Original we thought we gonna stay long time in Pole –in the meantime we heard they killing already Jews.</span> <span id="s294">They killed a Jew there, they beat up -.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s296">WH: From the story you told me, where a few hundred ran away, and the other thousand said, ‘Shema Yisrael’ there it took an action on your part to save your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">SH: I always had in my mind, during the German time, I will not sit and wait until they come and shoot me even if I see he comes, I’ll run!</span> <span id="s298">(inaudible)...from the 300 I want you to know, it is important to tell, from the 300 that are on their way from about, oh, the total must be close to 4,000...10% run away but there was no place where to run!</span> <span id="s299">There was 2,000 kilometers away were the front –and where we ran, the Ukrainian police and the Germans were running, trying to catch us.</span> <span id="s300">The fact is, where we were liberated only 8 ½ months later we start to look around, how many people were saved.</span> <span id="s301">And we find ourselves about 35-36 people from this entire camp from Kamunka were alive.</span> <span id="s302">From our shtetl of Chorostkow, which was over 2,000 in our shtetl...100 were left.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">WH: It seems to me, that it’s quite a coincidence that of the very few people who made it, who ran away, you and your brother both made it –I’m wondering, did he also have the answers like you?</span> <span id="s304">‘I’m not going to sit around and wait until the Germans.’</span></p> <p><span id="s305">SH: ...yeh...we always talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">WH: Did this have anything to do with the way your parents brought you up, their attitudes or the type of people your parents were?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">SH: No, I would say it’s ‘mazel’ – just thank G-d we were lucky.</span> <span id="s308">We were able to run away.</span> <span id="s309">Not because we did something.</span> <span id="s310">I just did not want to wait like when I saw this coming, I always run away.</span> <span id="s311">The time when I was suppose to go to concentration camp, I mention, I got a job...in a farm to work.</span> <span id="s312">In camp, himself, whenever was, I tried to do things not be ready –tomorrow they should shoot me – and I worked hard and somehow I built up a little reputation in camp, ‘cause I’m a good worker and this also helped a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">WH: Every day of course was a struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">SH: EVERY DAY, every minute...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">WH: People in the camp must have mentally given up at many points at which you didn’t give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">SH: I worry, if somebody gonna be alive, I told you about it, but personally, I said I’m not giving up.</span> <span id="s317">I’ll always do something.</span> <span id="s318">I’ll do my best to run away.</span> <span id="s319">If I’ll be caught, I’ll be caught, but at least I would not wait.</span> <span id="s320">If I would see he’s coming after me, if I cannot fight him, I would try to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">WH: So, after all this happened, you went by Poland and you had an uncle in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">SH: ‘Yes...my brother and I opened up a wholesale –flour, sugar...kasha, and all this and...we had a good business.</span> <span id="s323">I planned to stay there.</span> <span id="s324">But when I found out they start to kill Jews in several places.</span> <span id="s325">I decided in December, 1945 that we’re gonna leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">WH: How did you do that?</span> <span id="s327">You were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">SH: No.</span> <span id="s329">I made arrangements that she and her mother...and my brother and I and cousins and some other friends.</span> <span id="s330">We paid them.</span> <span id="s331">We had money because we were in business already, and we thought we’d be able to go –legally.</span> <span id="s332">We wanted to go to West Germany.</span> <span id="s333">But this was false.</span> <span id="s334">They fooled us.</span> <span id="s335">(His wife says, They were inaccurate...the transport, whatever people had registered under, who had visas to go into Germany, but when we got to the Czechoslovakian border it turned out, that they did not obtain a transit visa to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s336">So the Czechoslovakian authorities said, ‘ You cannot go through -.’)</span> <span id="s337">We somehow, with very big difficulty came to Western Germany.</span> <span id="s338">We had friends in a camp.</span> <span id="s339">(Fairmount?)</span> <span id="s340">...When we came in there, and I saw people are still going with a can to get a little soup in the kitchen, people still sleep several families in one room.</span> <span id="s341">I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s342">I had some money with me.</span> <span id="s343">I felt already I am a liberated man and I don’t want to stay this way...I found an apartment...community of 500 Jewish families...and we arranged, -got married, and we start to think about it, ‘Yes,’ we want to go to America, possible to Israel, we thought.</span> <span id="s344">But, if until we will go we want to live like human beings, we don’t want to stay in a camp like many, I would say probably 90% of the survivors lived in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">WH: And you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">SH: We didn’t.</span> <span id="s347">We took an apartment and we looked around for a business...in 1946 we opened up already a business in West Germany, and thank G-d we were able to make not only a good living, but we were able to help other people.</span> <span id="s348">We were Zionist, my brother and I.</span> <span id="s349">We organized a Zionist organization in Berlin...the Jewish people came, and we helped...that time we used to go illegal to Israel.</span> <span id="s350">We helped many people to go on the Exodus...G-d helped us, we had a son, Freddy was born in 1048.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">WH: In other words, you were already there for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">SH: Yes, and we had a very fine business...my brother got married in Germany...we took care of the family life, took care of the Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">WH: At this point you couldn’t come to America yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">SH: No.</span> <span id="s355">No.</span> <span id="s356">We registered ourselves immediately, but it wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s357">It took us three years...</span></p> <p><span id="s358">WH: Why did it take so long?</span> <span id="s359">The affidavit took so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">SH: No.</span> <span id="s361">America, they wouldn’t let in.</span> <span id="s362">There’s a new law came up with Truman came out with a new law, and he allowed us people -.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">WH: D.P. people?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">SH: -If we can come in.</span> <span id="s365">But until this law they wouldn’t let in –only you had to have like a son could come to a father or to a mother, a brother to a brother.</span> <span id="s366">To a sister she was very close she was –an uncle was already...it took time.</span> <span id="s367">It was very tough to come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">WH: What about Israel?</span> <span id="s369">You said you had thought about going?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">SH: When Freddy was born I changed my mind because I –felt I went through such a terrible war and the conditions were still in Israel very tough.</span> <span id="s371">My uncle, was ready.</span> <span id="s372">‘Come, you can always go to Israel from America,’ and I decided I want to go to America and if I wanted to go to Israel, I’ll always be able from America.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">WH: So, you got to the United States.</span> <span id="s374">The boat left from where?</span> <span id="s375">Bremerhaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">SH: Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s377">From Bremerhaven we went with General Eltinger.</span> <span id="s378">This was an army boat.</span> <span id="s379">It took us nine days to come to Boston.</span> <span id="s380">And from Boston –we were an hour in Boston and we came right away to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">WH: What was the trip like?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">SH: I was mostly sick.</span> <span id="s383">My wife was pregnant with our second son, David.</span> <span id="s384">And I thought I’ll be able to help out, but I was sick, very much and she was helping me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">WH: You got seasick?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">SH: I was seasick, yes.</span> <span id="s387">And I still till today I don’t like to go on a boat.</span> <span id="s388">But we came here and I came here, and I start to –I saw the realistic of America, I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s389">My mouth was completely closed.</span> <span id="s390">My wife spoke a little English, but very little.</span> <span id="s391">But I couldn’t speak at all.</span> <span id="s392">Because in Germany, while she was able to go to a teacher and learn some English, I was busy in my business.</span> <span id="s393">But I had some money, not too much, about $6,000 that time I came already to America.</span> <span id="s394">And for $1,000 we organized ourselves a little apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">WH: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">SH: In the Bronx, on Webster Avenue near the Concourse.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">WH: When you came here in the beginning and took the train to New York –did your uncle meet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">SH: I came to my uncle, yah, and my uncle gave me a very fine welcome.</span> <span id="s399">I slept over one night at my uncle and I thought that my uncle had such a big apartment.</span> <span id="s400">When I came in, my aunt gave us a beautiful dinner and she gave us a bedroom and we went to bed we thought this was wonderful.</span> <span id="s401">But when I got up in the morning and saw my uncle and my aunt sleeping on the chairs, so I said, ‘No, I don’t want to do this.’</span> <span id="s402">The next day I arranged with myself a furnished room, and we went, and later on after a few months we were able to get a small apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">WH: This was ’48?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">SH: No, ’49.</span> <span id="s405">And, in order to learn English, I went to work for a company called Daitch Shopwell...I worked there for a year time, and I open up a little bit my mouth, I was able to understand (inaudible) English, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">WH: You didn’t go to night school?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">SH: After a year, no I did, at nighttime we used to go to Fordham University.</span> <span id="s408">I lived very close, Fordham-Fordam Road.</span> <span id="s409">Nighttime we used to go four, five times a week, I used to go for two hours to learn English.</span> <span id="s410">And daytime, it helped to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">WH: I’d like to know if you could remember when you were on the boat...what was your first reaction when you saw...(came to New York).</span></p> <p><span id="s412">SH: When I came in the nighttime, we came at nighttime and they wouldn’t let us out for whole night.</span> <span id="s413">Just till the morning.</span> <span id="s414">And we –I saw thousands of cars are going.</span> <span id="s415">Well, in Europe we didn’t see cars.</span> <span id="s416">If a car used to pass through it was a big deal.</span> <span id="s417">And here I saw thousands of cars are going –I thought that everybody was a wealthy man.</span> <span id="s418">Everybody very smart.</span> <span id="s419">I was very much impressed.</span> <span id="s420">What do you know.</span> <span id="s421">We were young, hopeful and thanking G-d we were alive!</span> <span id="s422">And planning, and, and thank G-d, G-d was good to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">WH: What was your first impression of Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">SH: Very much.</span> <span id="s425">I was very pleased that I came to America.</span> <span id="s426">Because I came in, things what was very important in Europe, I saw is not important to have.</span> <span id="s427">To have an apartment where you have already hot water and cold water and bathroom facilities (inaudible) was normal for the average American.</span> <span id="s428">In Europe, in order to have such an apartment, you have to be rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">WH: what about the people?</span> <span id="s430">The people on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">SH: The people on the boat were most of them were D.P.’s, Jews and non-Jews and of course I always like to talk, to find out, and I was friendly, and I am friendly.</span> <span id="s432">The atmosphere –people were nice to us.</span> <span id="s433">On the boat there was not too much what to do, especially if you didn’t feel good.</span> <span id="s434">But when we came out my uncle gave me a very fine welcome.</span> <span id="s435">And I went to work.</span> <span id="s436">And although I-I worked very hard, but I didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s437">I didn’t mind at all to work.</span> <span id="s438">But, I felt that this is the place which I wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">WH: When you were working for Daitch, you eventually went into business for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">SH: I worked with Daitch for a year and a half.</span> <span id="s441">After a year, I start to look for a business...I left about $5,000 in the bank.</span> <span id="s442">And I start to look for a business, and I took in another fellow which also was a survivor...his name was Julius Israel...he and I, used to Sunday, we didn’t go to work, we used to plan how to go into business.</span> <span id="s443">In the meantime my brother came.</span> <span id="s444">So my brother, and I, and this Israel, bought one store on Broadway and 41st Street.</span> <span id="s445">We bought this store for $36,000... and we start to work very hard.</span> <span id="s446">I already knew a little bit of business.</span> <span id="s447">My brother just came from the boat.</span> <span id="s448">The other fellow (inaudible) knows a little bit.</span> <span id="s449">And we start to smile nice to the ladies, we gave them good service, good prices.</span> <span id="s450">I think we considered ourselves business people who know how to run a business and we did our business 50% more than the owner before who sold us the store.</span> <span id="s451">And after a year and a half we paid off the entire mortgage.</span> <span id="s452">When we paid off the mortgage I felt already strong.</span> <span id="s453">One time our driver...tells me a Safeway going to be closed because the store is for them too small.</span> <span id="s454">‘would you like to see it?’</span> <span id="s455">I said, ‘yes.’</span> <span id="s456">He took me over...I took a look, I see the store is a bigger store.</span> <span id="s457">I walked over to the manager and asked him how much business the store does.</span> <span id="s458">He told me, the store is doing a nice business.</span> <span id="s459">I find out it’s doing as much business as my store did.</span> <span id="s460">The size was about the same, so I went right to the landlord.</span> <span id="s461">It wasn’t so easy, but finally, the (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s462">landlord) and I signed the lease...meantime I needed some money.</span> <span id="s463">Eleven o’clock at night on Channel 7, Citibank advertise that any businessman needs a loan –he should come to Citibank.</span> <span id="s464">I needed money.</span> <span id="s465">Monday morning, I came up to Citibank.</span> <span id="s466">They called themselves that time, National Citibank –I came and I told them –I heard you advertise you wanna give loans.</span> <span id="s467">I have one store that is already completely paid off, I want to open up another store and I need some loan.</span> <span id="s468">He didn’t mark down anything.</span> <span id="s469">He asked me my name, where I have the store, from where I come, how long I am in the country.</span> <span id="s470">He didn’t mark anything down, but he did remember because I know he asked me which one am I doing business.</span> <span id="s471">Later on the wholesale people told me, that he did ask about me.</span> <span id="s472">And they told him, that I run a business proper.</span> <span id="s473">And I pay my bills.</span> <span id="s474">He told me, ‘Mr. Halpern, why don’t you come in Thursday.</span> <span id="s475">Thursday, we’ll see what we can do for you.’</span> <span id="s476">I came in Thursday, and the check was ready.</span> <span id="s477">He gave me the loan whatever I needed.</span> <span id="s478">And we opened a second store.</span> <span id="s479">And a year later a third store.</span> <span id="s480">By 4 years we had already 4 supermarkets.</span> <span id="s481">We were considered a chain.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">WH: What was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">SH: Thrifty Supermarkets.</span> <span id="s484">The first one called Food (inaudible) Supermarkets.</span> <span id="s485">And three, we had ‘Thrifty’s.’</span> <span id="s486">We had three on Broadway, and one in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s487">And, as we felt we had already some money, maybe my brother and I had already a hundred thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s488">We felt =we start to miss the Shabbas.</span> <span id="s489">My brother, he start –we always had kosher when we came here to eat kosher.</span> <span id="s490">We always davened, but Shabbos I had to work in the store and I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s491">And then, Jewish people used to pass by the store going Shabbos davening.</span> <span id="s492">From davening, my brother suffered terribly and I suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">WH: Where were you, in mid-town?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">SH: Broadway...122nd, 141st and 148th...and I said we have to do something to go into business where Shabbos you should be able to go davening.</span> <span id="s495">So, we looked around...(inaudible) we wanted to buy out Manischewitz...just a business, you know, before we came, we only looked how to make parnoses.</span> <span id="s496">Not to work for somebody.</span> <span id="s497">To work hard, but to work by yourself.</span> <span id="s498">I didn’t want to –I felt, that to work for somebody like I’m a slave again and I didn’t want to be a number like I was in concentration camp, a number.</span> <span id="s499">I wanted to be –I should be, somehow (inaudible) if you work for somebody in a factory, a thousand people working five hundred people working, I felt I’m a number there.</span> <span id="s500">I didn’t like this at all.</span> <span id="s501">And finally, I start to look around.</span> <span id="s502">I found some people, they are in the building trade, and I drove out, and looked up, and I saw, ‘What ‘cha doing?’</span> <span id="s503">You watching, and it’s a business like any other business.</span> <span id="s504">Of course we went very conservative.</span> <span id="s505">I had that time, with my brother, with my partner, we had four stores, so we sold one store.</span> <span id="s506">And we got out $40,000 and we went and we made, and we bought with some other partners, 39 lots.</span> <span id="s507">(inaudible) And after we finished one job, we saw we can make a living.</span> <span id="s508">We have to sell off the stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">WH: These lots were for stores?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">SH: One family houses...</span></p> <p><span id="s511">WH: You didn’t really have direct experience in the building business...?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">SH: It’s a business like any other business.</span> <span id="s513">I think the most experience I gained in business is in my father’s business which I sold one dekker of feffer, one pound of salt, one pound of sugar, and to go to the store, or to help sell, to buy some wheat, grain from the farmer.</span> <span id="s514">Business is business.</span> <span id="s515">If you know how, this is business.</span> <span id="s516">You have to do, just like a writer knows how to write,

much Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s534">She said how Roosevelt was a savior.</span> <span id="s535">Roosevelt, was the one where saved the, the Jews, and saved America, saved this, so I got upset, I says, ‘Roosevelt should be, uhh, Roosevelt, because of –Roosevelt could have saved a million Jews or more and he didn’t save’ –those people wanted to kill me on the bus.</span> <span id="s536">‘What do you mean, I said something against Roosevelt?’</span></p> <p><span id="s537">WH: Mostly American -.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">SH: Mostly Americans.</span> <span id="s539">They ALL

is not good.</span> <span id="s543">I said Roosevelt should be tried the same way as Hitler.’</span> <span id="s544">This is the way I remember I told them: ‘Roosevelt and Churchill...(inaudible) ...because if two fellows are watching the third one –three fellows are going together, and one is being attacked and, and these two are watching and not helping, they should be tried the same way, I said.</span> <span id="s545">When the, when the Nuremberg where they had the trials for the S.S. they should have had Roosevelt and Churchill the same time...(inaudible?pardoned?)</span> <span id="s546">because they could have saved the Jews and they didn’t.</span> <span id="s547">Those American Jews looked at me, ‘Wha-wha-kind of chutzpah this greener boy!’</span> <span id="s548">But I told them.</span> <span id="s549">I always used to talk.</span> <span id="s550">I talk to my children, even, and some, not every survivor has talked about it.</span> <span id="s551">I took my sons –my two sons already I took them to Auschwitz –I took my older son, my middle son, my younger son, I took into Auschwitz .</span> <span id="s552">Now, of course, after the liberation.</span> <span

you have memories of what happened, right very clearly.</span> <span id="s563">Do you ever find that you have nightmares?</span> <span id="s564">Do you ever dream about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">SH: Yes.</span> <span id="s566">Sometimes I have a (inaudible?</span> <span id="s567">memory) they are still running after me and I wake up.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">WH: More now than

Challenge, I feel.</span> <span id="s615">(inaudible) Security is one thing, but challenge is very important.</span> <span id="s616">Security is not for everyone.</span> <span id="s617">I mean, certain people cannot challenge.</span> <span id="s618">You’ll find out a 100 boys from the same colleges to the Army –90 will stay soldiers –9 will become officers –one will become a general.</span>

up?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">SH: Not enough.</span> <span id="s678">No.</span> <span id="s679">I have a little guilty conscience.</span> <span id="s680">I should have spent more, and I tell THEM to spend more with their children –because I came, as I tell you before, a greener and I couldn’t speak English and I didn’t want to be number, a factory worker.</span> <span id="s681">In order to stay in business, I wanted to achieve very much.</span> <span id="s682">And it’s not only that you start a business and the business is going good –it’s ‘Oh, this greener made money as a good business and he lost it –I want to watch it’ and I’m still, ‘’til today, the business money I watch out with it.</span> <span id="s683">I work today just as much as I worked 40 years ago.</span> <span

American children –my sons had quite a few friends both of them.</span> <span id="s695">American and non-American and survivor’s children.</span> <span id="s696">They all American, but the really closest, the really close friends are the survivor’s children.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">WH: How about you, yourself.</span> <span id="s698">Would you say all your close friends are survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">SH: My survivors are my closest friends.</span> <span id="s700">I have many American friends but the survivors are my closest.</span></p> <p><span

because we didn’t understand either).</span></p> <p><span id="s704">SH: I cannot blame them for that...</span></p> <p><span id="s705">WH: What about your kids?</span> <span id="s706">Do you think they cannot understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">SH: (His wife says: ‘They are trying to grasp it.</span> <span id="s708">It’s a very difficult thing to grasp...</span></p> <p><span id="s709">SH: They killed Jews in Chockroff (?)</span> <span id="s710">...people know, right the next day, somehow, we know they killed them but we didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s711">It is almost like, if a man is sick on cancer.</span> <span id="s712">You know he’s sick on cancer, he knows he’s gonna die, but yet he hopes tomorrow is gonna be a new medicine that’s gonna come out and he’s gonna be cured.</span> <span id="s713">Most patients, believe, until –(inaudible) everything is alright, that they already, (inaudible) but in the beginning, they still believe, there’s probably gonna come out a new medicine and is gonna be cured.</span> <span id="s714">We hoped.</span> <span id="s715">Yes, it did happen in Chorostkow, but Chorostkow probably is gonna be saved.</span> <span id="s716">And what happened?</span> <span id="s717">They wouldn’t do –they wouldn’t do it probably, America will come and attack Russia and will attack Germany and they will win the war.</span> <span id="s718">This is human nature.</span> <span id="s719">People don’t want to believe this.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">WH: Speaking of human nature, do you think what happened in Europe could happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">SH: Yes, it can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">WH: Tell me what you think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">SH: I feel that it can happen.</span> <span id="s724">It may not happen tomorrow.</span> <span id="s725">It may not happen the day after , but if the change in politics can come up, and this can happen some time (inaudible) (by) some IDIOT like Jackson...but if somebody comes out and starts talk against the Jews and he wins, then things can happen.</span> <span id="s726">In the normal –it’s a little bit better in America than in Europe because in America, we have many (inaudible?</span> <span id="s727">refugees?)</span> <span id="s728">...in Europe there were only Jews against Poles, Jews against Germans...(inaudible).</span> <span id="s729">The second one to attack, there was the Jew.</span> <span id="s730">In America they have schvartze, the schvartze (inaudible?</span> <span id="s731">the schvartze helping us out??)</span> <span id="s732">Rather they should criticize everything what the Jew does, they criticize the schvartze...(inaudible) and we have 50 –60 different nationalities and this is good.</span> <span id="s733">But here, it can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">WH: They don’t like us too much, do they?</span> <span id="s735">The schvartze.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">SH: Nobody likes Jews.</span> <span id="s737">Because, also a reason, the reason’s because the Jew is a little bit more independent.</span> <span id="s738">The Jew helps himself a little bit (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s739">SH: (his wife says: ‘The Jew is more disciplined.</span> <span id="s740">Am I making sense?”)</span></p> <p><span id="s741">WH: Yes.</span> <span id="s742">One of my questions is: ‘Why the Jew survived for so many thousands of years.</span> <span id="s743">How are we different.</span> <span id="s744">How was it, that after everything that we went through, and we went through more terrible things than any other group of people in recent history, I mean, what happen to us with Hitler and Auschwitz, how did we find the strength, after everything we went through, to come here, start our lives again, to learn to hope, to love, to live again, to have children, to raise families, how are we optimistic enough to be able to do that after seeing so many terrible things –how is it possible to recover after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">SH: (his wife says: ‘The natural power of life...’)</span></p> <p><span id="s746">SH: (inaudible –and needs translation)...I feel the only way to survive, because of the religious, strongly religious, and when they weren’t religious, they became one.</span> <span id="s747">(difficult audio) We would be today, a nation almost (inaudible –gestiner?)</span> <span id="s748">...However, the majority what we lost, the reason we such a small nation, because, through assimilation.</span> <span id="s749">We lost most of the Jewish people, because they assimilated.</span> <span id="s750">And here in America...(inaudible) we lost because they assimilate.</span> <span id="s751">You see, the Reform Judaism, very fine people.</span> <span id="s752">The average Reform Jew is a good Jew.</span> <span id="s753">He doesn’t like to go ( his voice heightens and then lowers) too much in to shul, and he doesn’t –but he’s a good Jew and he helps Israel.</span> <span id="s754">What happens is that the third generation of every Reform Jew becomes a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s755">I say, ‘every,’ maybe it’s a little bit exaggerate but I –70-80% which I notice, very fine Reform Jews, a grandfather who is a Reform Jew, the son doesn’t go –marries a shiksa, and, and, and his daughter is already a –granddaughter is already a, a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s756">The only discovery the Jews, but maybe we don’t exactly agree with them.</span> <span id="s757">The Jews like you grandfather.</span> <span id="s758">And my grandfather.</span> <span id="s759">My father.</span> <span id="s760">This is the Jews they holding back, because we had trouble, (needs translation) what came 350 years ago.</span> <span id="s761">He took away a majority of people, and later on we became non-Jews.</span> <span id="s762">Hassidim saved a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s763">It’s important the Jews of Boro Park and the Jews of Meier (?)</span> <span id="s764">Shareem, we don’t agree with them but yet we need them.</span> <span id="s765">They help us a lot.</span> <span id="s766">The Jewish people were, when they talking a hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s767">Now, your other question was, ‘How come the survivors are able to organize themselves, and to have families, and to have business, and to have jobs.’</span> <span id="s768">I think the Jew is a little bit, (needs translation) we are a little bit, we are the chosen, better.</span> <span id="s769">We came here.</span> <span id="s770">First we try.</span> <span id="s771">It’s the same as I did.</span> <span id="s772">It’s –most of the people.</span> <span id="s773">First we want to establish how to make a living.</span> <span id="s774">Then we start to establish ourselves, we start to making a living.</span> <span id="s775">We start to, ‘How can I go Shabbas davening/’ ‘How can I send my children to Yeshiva?’</span> <span id="s776">‘How can I help the other one who doesn’t have it?’</span> <span id="s777">‘How can I help Israel?’</span> <span id="s778">This is the way Jewish people, we were taught.</span> <span id="s779">(Mosheh Rabbeni) taught us 4,000 years ago, (Rabbeni?)</span> <span id="s780">taught us that we have to give charity, that we have to run around the streets to find people to give charity.</span> <span id="s781">Moshen Rabbeni (he says, ‘Rabbweni’ instead of Rabbenu’) taught us how to give charity.</span> <span id="s782">We were always, we were always in the forefront.</span> <span id="s783">The leaders in the world were Jews who was –Jesus was a Jew and he proclaimed that we have to give charity.</span> <span id="s784">Karl Marx was a Jew and he was a wealthy Jew, Karl Marx.</span> <span id="s785">He didn’t come from a poor family.</span> <span id="s786">And Karl Marx came out and he said, ‘We cannot say one should have a lot and the other one should starve from hunger.’</span> <span id="s787">Karl Marx came out and he said we have to help the man.’</span> <span id="s788">We, Jewish people have been known to be leaders, and we have known to, to, to help the, the one who need it.</span> <span id="s789">And I think what we did –we maybe look only on the wealthy one and the more educated, but we still have unfortunately, quite a few Jewish people they still suffer, they still don’t make enough money and we don’t look a them.</span> <span id="s790">You’ll find in Boro Park people who still working for $200 a week and (inaudible) people live there, they still go to work in factories.</span> <span id="s791">You don’t talk to them about that.</span> <span id="s792">The Jew is proud.</span> <span id="s793">You’ll find probably a smaller percentage on welfare Jews than any other one.</span> <span id="s794">But, also, something has to do with –just because we went through so many things, through the 1,000 of years, and lately the last 130 years, we are (inaudible) and I think, what we did here, (inaudible)...everybody, you’ll find from the survivors, you’ll see, there’s about 140,000-150,000 survivors, how many became wealthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">WH: Not too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">SH: Not too many became wealthy.</span> <span id="s797">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s798">WH: What do you think was the difference?</span> <span id="s799">People you know.</span> <span id="s800">The peoples whom you meet at dinners.</span> <span id="s801">Who give charity.</span> <span id="s802">Who are able to give.</span> <span id="s803">Do you see in any way any difference between them and the other people in terms of what their goals were and what their ideas were?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">SH: (His wife says: ‘Maybe it’s the same as any other...(inaudible)...it’s just that the Jews were different.’)</span> <span id="s805">I see Americans, some of Americans will say, I make a comfortable living, why do I have to work hard to pay more taxes?</span> <span id="s806">Why do I need it?</span> <span id="s807">My sons will give me a thank you?</span> <span id="s808">I’ll have to help them to go through school.</span> <span id="s809">Education to give them, and I still work.</span> <span id="s810">This all goes with the greener too, with survivors.</span> <span id="s811">A few of us, don’t want any charity.</span> <span id="s812">If have to pay taxes, then we have to pay taxes!!</span> <span id="s813">I’m proud to pay taxes.</span> <span id="s814">I, thank G-d, pay big taxes.</span> <span id="s815">And I’m very proud of this.</span> <span id="s816">But to me it is a challenge.</span> <span id="s817">I’m thank G-d, now 67 years old, I’m gonna be 68, G-d should give me healthy years –I don’t even plan to retire.</span> <span id="s818">I could have retired 10 or 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s819">But this is the way we feel.</span> <span id="s820">To me, the business is a challenge, prestige.</span> <span id="s821">If I can, if I retire I maybe wouldn’t be able to give as much charity.</span> <span id="s822">This way I can help my people –they need my help, which he is not in a position to get.</span> <span id="s823">‘Cause, if I retire, and he wouldn’t make it, there’s some kind of (inaudible) that’s gonna be like this.</span> <span id="s824">If I make more money, I will spend more money.</span> <span id="s825">And I’m not the only one.</span> <span id="s826">Most people think the same way.</span> <span id="s827">But, uhh, you say why one succeeded, and the other didn’t succeeded, this does not only go to survivors.</span> <span id="s828">This question can be for everybody.</span> <span id="s829">You find in America, American people, they’re here several hundred years here in the country, and some did make it and some didn’t make, much,</span></p> <p><span id="s830">SH: (His wife: ‘This is so.’</span> <span id="s831">She asks the interviewer a question: ‘You became a professor of a prestigious college, how many boys went to school with you, how many of them became successful and prominent as you?’</span></p> <p><span id="s832">WH: It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s833">The only thing I can say is, that in doing the interviews with people, and talking with survivors, and thinking of my own community.</span> <span id="s834">A lot of the children did do well...statistics...that the children of survivors are the least assimilated of Jewish children in America...survivors and their children have the highest rate of identification with Jews of any part of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s835">They seem to be carrying it on to their own children also.</span> <span id="s836">You told me yourself, that your grandchildren will go to yeshiva, right, that they are religious.</span> <span id="s837">I think, to me, to the world, to America, it’s got to be remarkable that after everything that you went through that you tell us, that you say you believe in G-d, that you daven every morning, and that’s a very, very important thing for other people to know...(inaudible) when the Viet Nam war happened here, what did you think?</span> <span id="s838">What was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">SH: I’m gonna say –it’s a good question!</span> <span id="s840">In my house, my two sons, Freddy and David were that time in the college.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">WH: Where were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">SH: Freddy was in the University of Pennsylvania, the oldest, and David was in Boston University.</span> <span id="s843">And the colleges were of course against Viet Nam.</span> <span id="s844">And we were with them.</span> <span id="s845">College boys.</span> <span id="s846">And we felt exactly the way – I was a patriot.</span> <span id="s847">American patriot.</span> <span id="s848">I love –I still love America because I remember how it was to live, NOT in America.</span> <span id="s849">Not even by Hitler, but even before the war in Poland that we had very little to say.</span> <span id="s850">And here, thank G-d, we are, we are free people, when we are ‘free.’</span> <span id="s851">We MEAN IT free!</span> <span id="s852">And we are successful, and we have a good life, and I’m an American patriot.</span> <span id="s853">And to me, I thought that whatever my president
