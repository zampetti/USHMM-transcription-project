<html><body><p><span id="s1">Samuel Rosen - PhoenixPRIVATE I was born in Ccespochowa, Poland, in March 19, 1924; my father's name was David, my mother was Rosa; I had a brother two years older; my sister was 4 years younger.</span> <span id="s2">My brother died in the U.S.; my sister lives in the U.S. My father died at the age of 92 in the U.S.; my mother was killed in a cemetary in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">In Ccespochowa there were 150,000 people of which about 30,000 were Jews.</span> <span id="s4">85% of the Jews lived in a certain area.</span> <span id="s5">We lived outside of that area.</span> <span id="s6">I went to a Jewis public school run by the Polish Government.</span> <span id="s7">The walk to school was passed a Polish school which was not easy.</span> <span id="s8">Scholasticlly the school for the Jews were good but of course the newer buildings were available to Polish children.</span> <span id="s9">It was only in the larger cities that they had Jewish public schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">In 1935 I witnessed a pogrom.</span> <span id="s11">It was triggered by an argument between a Jew and a Pole.</span> <span id="s12">Knives were used and the Pole was killed.</span> <span id="s13">That started the progrom.</span> <span id="s14">Jewish apartments were stoned, Jews were beaten and killed.</span> <span id="s15">Police did not interfere.</span> <span id="s16">On the third day they had to import some police from Warsaw and they brought it under control.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">In September 1939 Hitler marched in, there was no opposition.</span> <span id="s18">Some young people went East.</span> <span id="s19">My uncle went on a bicycle to the East and later returned for his wife and child but they had been killed and he escaped to the underground and survived.</span> <span id="s20">There was no way to escape and no money or physical means to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">At first they confused the population.</span> <span id="s22">That lasted two days.</span> <span id="s23">Then they set up machineguns in the Jewish area aimed towards the Jews.</span> <span id="s24">Jews did not allow themselves to see the reality of what they were doing.</span> <span id="s25">All of a sudden they started to shootup the town.</span> <span id="s26">Truckloads of German soldiers were pushing people into the churches and the synagogues.</span> <span id="s27">Then the struggle to survive started.</span> <span id="s28">The Gestapo chased Jews out of their homes.</span> <span id="s29">They established the Judenrat, the Jewish Council, to administer the Jews according to their orders.</span> <span id="s30">Sometimes not very reputable Jews were given the leadership thinking they could save themselves by cooperating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s31">In our city the leadership did their best.</span> <span id="s32">They tried to urge the Germans to ease certain burdens.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">The Gestapo told the Judenrate to round up electricians, plumbers, etc to to the steel mill or munition factory .</span> <span id="s34">My family went to the Jewish section to my uncle who owned a small plant.</span> <span id="s35">My uncle cleared out a small space and we hid there.</span> <span id="s36">It was near the Big Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">All towns in the vicinity were Judenrein.</span> <span id="s38">All Jews would have to leave for the ghettos.</span> <span id="s39">75.000 were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s40">Jews went out to work in the gentile section and barter work or valuables for food in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s41">The ghetto had gates, there were no telephones, newspapers, mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">In 1941 the Big Ghetto started and it lasted till September 1942.</span> <span id="s43">In June 1943 the small ghetto had a population of Jews of 6000 or 5500.</span> <span id="s44">70,000 were transported to Treblinka to die.</span> <span id="s45">Those who were left were in the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s46">The Germans were building a camp adjacent tothe major factories .</span> <span id="s47">Eventually they liquidat4ed the small gjetto in June 1943 and until the liberation we were in the concetrantion camp which was adjacent to the munition factories.</span> <span id="s48">Private firms had contracts with the Gestapo to receive Jewish workers.</span> <span id="s49">They Samuel Rosen Page 2 paid to the Gestapo 40 marks per week for each of us.</span> <span id="s50">We were bartered amd sold for money in thar particular salvery agreement.</span> <span id="s51">The Germans were getting the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Going back to the transportation of the population to Treblenkain September 1942, the date was at Rosh Hashona, they deliberately chose that date.</span> <span id="s53">People were called to the market square and there the selection would take place.</span> <span id="s54">To the right, to the left.</span> <span id="s55">6000 or 5500 to the left, 70,000 to the right to go to Treblenka.</span> <span id="s56">In September 1942 they did not know where they were going.</span> <span id="s57">We heard from the grapevine and they were killing people and gassing them in a truck, executions of rabbis, but nothing about the magnitude of what was happening.</span> <span id="s58">We hesrd from the Germans there were be resettlement.</span> <span id="s59">I was then 15 or 16 years old and it was very difficult not to know what was happening without any choices.</span> <span id="s60">It was impossible to communicate with anyone.</span> <span id="s61">There was no place to escape to, there was no place to go.</span> <span id="s62">We were locked in, to escape to the woods without weapons was unthinkable.</span> <span id="s63">The Poles were awarded 2 kilograms of sugar to deliver Jews.</span> <span id="s64">Nothing was open.</span> <span id="s65">It was impossible to resist.</span> <span id="s66">Anyone who attempted to escape would be killed and everyone around him would be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">I was personally responsible for my family not going to the square.</span> <span id="s68">We hid underground behind a door.</span> <span id="s69">It was a small place, a cellar, a hole in the ground to keep potatoes.</span> <span id="s70">We could not stand;' my mother, father, cousin, sister, another older person.</span> <span id="s71">I felt going to the transport was the end.</span> <span id="s72">I happened to be right.</span> <span id="s73">We had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s74">I scavenged around the empty houses and looked for potatoe p~eelings, bread and we would bring it back and try to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">My brother decided to go out.</span> <span id="s76">He was taken to the small ghetto and he was the only one who knew where we were.</span> <span id="s77">The Gestapo picked him up.</span> <span id="s78">He somehow ran back to where we were hiding and told us to be ready and that he would be back and it worked.</span> <span id="s79">I was underground two weeks.</span> <span id="s80">The drive to live is so strong - there were no sanitary facilities, just to relieve oneself, you took your life in your hands going outside, no food.</span> <span id="s81">There were dogs above us running around, how they did not detect us was a mystery.</span> <span id="s82">They were finding hidden people, if they didn't have a transport, they shot them.</span> <span id="s83">90-90% of the people who were found were taken to toehr transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Fortunately they didn't turn the water system off.</span> <span id="s85">We each had our duties; to be on the lookout constantly to see who entered the gate.</span> <span id="s86">We were 120 feet from the lookout pointof the gate which directly opened to the street.</span> <span id="s87">Noone complained, we existed.</span> <span id="s88">We allowed 2 people to go out to stretch for short periods.</span> <span id="s89">Basically we hoped we could get into the small ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">We went out and we started to work in a railroad company repairing railroad equipment.</span> <span id="s91">I worked in a small shop.</span> <span id="s92">I was a mechanic working on the lathe.</span> <span id="s93">There was a German in the shop from Berlin who had been a socialist.</span> <span id="s94">He was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s95">He helped me and brought me food.</span> <span id="s96">We planned to bribe the guards to get our family out.</span> <span id="s97">One guard was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s98">With the help of the guards we first took 1/2 of them out of the underground and then the second group.</span> <span id="s99">That morning at 6 o'clock we were supposed to get up and we overslept.</span> <span id="s100">That was the first time that ever happened and that fact helped us to survive, the guards helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">SAM ROSEN - PHOENIX TAPE 11 It worked and we survived, my father who lived with us for 26 years and died at age 92 in Detroit; my sister who settled in Israel, my brother who lived in New York.</span> <span id="s102">~y mother was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">In the small ghetto there were young people older than I who knew a little bit about weapons and were daring and desperate.</span> <span id="s104">We had a connection with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s105">We started to prepare for an armed resistence.</span> <span id="s106">Some sneaked out of the ghetto to the outside, killed a German with a knife, took his weapon and went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s107">They made handgrenades, Molotov cocktails.</span> <span id="s108">In the amunition factory we had access to explosives.</span> <span id="s109">They didn't tell me about it because I had a a mother and father and sister and brother.</span> <span id="s110">My brother was not allowed to join eigther.</span> <span id="s111">Only people who had noone I was allowed to start making handgrenades on a lathe.</span> <span id="s112">There was a rotten apple among the Jews who apparently told the Germans about our preparations.</span> <span id="s113">That was a dark momentand a fatal blow to us.</span> <span id="s114">Some of the people were executed on the spot.</span> <span id="s115">They called evewryone to the square.</span> <span id="s116">one young man tried to shoot a Nazi.</span> <span id="s117">The revolver got stuck he was gunned down.</span> <span id="s118">They took 25 out and shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Degenhart, the Gestapo, was looking over the people who were left and stopped by my father who was 50.</span> <span id="s120">He was working in the shoe department and they did a lot of work for the Germans so he let him go.</span> <span id="s121">He asked me what I was doing.</span> <span id="s122">I had a good answer, I was a mechanic and toolmaker.</span> <span id="s123">He selected children and carried them to the cemetarey aned liuquidated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">We were settled in the camp adjacent to the ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s125">Two weeks later orders were issued to liquidate 10~ as a retribution for the attempt on the German soldier.</span> <span id="s126">They took 500 out and took them to the basement and carted them away in the morning killing them with wooden hammers, pushing people to the cemetary.</span> <span id="s127">They dug a long ditc killed off the people and pushed them in the ditch with a bulldozer.</span> <span id="s128">There were not more than 3 families intact at that time.</span> <span id="s129">The camp was in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">There was a technical high school and ghe Germans allowed it to continue to train mechanics.</span> <span id="s131">I had started in that school before the war and I was allowed to continue in 1940/41to learn toolmaking.</span> <span id="s132">It existed until the transports were carried away and then it was closed.</span> <span id="s133">This was very helpful to me because my skills were needed.</span> <span id="s134">They did not put numbers on us but gave us identification cards (he showe the card).</span> <span id="s135">We wore our own clothing, civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s136">I had a choice job in the mechanical department.</span> <span id="s137">I taught the mechanics who only said they were mechanics to save themselves.</span> <span id="s138">We were in the maintenance phase of the production lines I would make lamps, cigarette lighters, certain hardware that was desired by the farmers.</span> <span id="s139">Poles would smuggle it out and smuggle in food in exchange for these items.</span> <span id="s140">We were doing this at work.</span> <span id="s141">It wasthe night shift and someone was always on the lookout so that we would not be caught.</span> <span id="s142">We never got caughtand lots of people were able to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">on January 17, 1945 the Russians liberated us.</span> <span id="s144">When we saw Germans running away and pl planes coming over us, we were on the roof watching and enjoying watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">on the last day the German guards spoke to the Jews and asked them to come with them to Germany.</span> <span id="s146">350 people went with them.</span> <span id="s147">Some of the young people were rounding up ammunition .</span> <span id="s148">The Germans escaped before the Russians came.</span> <span id="s149">The Germans were afraid to force evacuation.</span> <span id="s150">Some Jews escaped in the woods and many were killed by the Poles.</span> <span id="s151">Of those who went with the Germans, some~survived and some could not make the marches.</span> <span id="s152">My best friend died on the last day of the war.</span> <span id="s153">We left the camp before the Russians came .</span> <span id="s154">We knew the city and we knew where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Some went into a deep depressionbecause they had noone who survived and they had nothing to live for.</span> <span id="s156">It was more difficult for the young girls than for the boys.</span> <span id="s157">I went to dschool for 6 more weeks to finish up and then went to rejoin my brother and father.</span> <span id="s158">I went to engineering school in Germany In 1950 I came to the U.S. through the Jewish Family Service.</span> <span id="s159">I settled in ohio.</span> <span id="s160">My father and brother were there.</span> <span id="s161">They left in 1949.</span> <span id="s162">We moved in with my family and I got a job.</span> <span id="s163">I have 3 children, two boys nd a girl, two are married and I have 5 grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">I want to say that during the war there was not one encouraging message given or trans through any media or packages or messages from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s165">I could not believe that they did not know what was going on.</span> <span id="s166">It was impossible for them not to know.</span> <span id="s167">If the Gestapo had been told they would be responsible after the war for the atrocities, they would not have been so brave.</span> <span id="s168">It was a feeling of total abandonment.</span> <span id="s169">I could not believe they did not know what was going on.</span> <span id="s170">I think the survivors and the historians have an obligation to tell the meaning of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s171">If we get careless, conditions will be created to have another Holocaust.</span> <span id="s172">It is very difficult for Americans to understand that terror and terrorism can terrorize totally.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">It is not easy to tell the story.</span> <span id="s174">I was designated to go to Treblenka and was somehow released.</span> <span id="s175">We were spared.</span> <span id="s176">I can understand why people cannot talk about it for 40 years We have a Holocaust educational process in ohio.</span> <span id="s177">Americans are taking it over and doing a tremendous job.</span></p></body></html>
