what you are telling me is that somebody who was your age at that time would have said, I'm leaving.</span> <span id="s377">Most people didn't – they didn't like him, but they didn't think he was that dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I said I'm not going to stay.</span> <span id="s379">I'm leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And why?</span> <span id="s381">Why did you do that at that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Because I didn't -- I didn't like what happen with Hitler.</span> <span id="s383">Our maid protected us, but -- and I had my French relatives, so

did your parents say when you said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: They didn't like it, but they said go, they said have a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Was your brother there?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: And I got French citizenship because my grandmother was in Alsace-Lorraine and I got my French citizenship, so I went back and forth.</span></p> <p><span

do?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: They went somewhere else, to a cousin of my mother.</span> <span id="s527">And when my dad -- my dad was in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Which concentration camp was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: In Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: He was in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: He was in Dachau but

id="s535">And when he came out of the concentration camp, he didn't know where my mom was because she could not stay in Lindau anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: So he had been arrested from Lindau?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: He was, yes, but then when he got out of the concentration camp, he didn't know where my mother was, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: How did he find her?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Well, he saw a few cousins and he knew where one was and he thought maybe she was there.</span> <span id="s540">And she was there.</span> <span id="s541">And then I don't know how long it took until they came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Was he -- did he ever talk about what happened to him in the Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No, we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s544">I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: I have the impression, correct me if I'm wrong, that as you were growing up, you didn't see much of your parents; you mostly had interaction with your nanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s547">And that's why when I came to the United States, I said I was so little with my parents, I go one year.</span> <span id="s548">My brother was a doctor in Queensborough, near Albany.</span> <span id="s549">So I say I go there.</span> <span id="s550">For one year, I stayed with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Was that the first time you were really close with them in the same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: What was that like because you were already a grownup lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I was glad to be with my parents.</span> <span id="s555">I was with my parents -- I was 18 when I left.</span> <span id="s556">And, you know, I just have to go because I was in Queensborough and I said I have to go one year, I have to go to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: But this must have been when your father had left Dachau.</span> <span id="s558">Did he seem a different person because of that?</span> <span id="s559">Had he been -- did he seem like he was older or sicker?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I hadn't seen him for so many years, I wouldn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: You wouldn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No.</span> <span id="s563">My parents had a very, very, very good life.</span> <span id="s564">The minute they came to the United States, they never had to work and my mother had her maid and they lived with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: In Albany, or near; in Troy?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well, it's between Troy and Albany.</span> <span id="s567">He had his office there.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Did he still have something with tobacco businesses, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s570">He was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Your brother, I know, but your parents, did your father--</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: He didn't have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: He didn't have to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: No.</span> <span id="s577">My parents did not have to work.</span> <span id="s578">Only thing was he had a dog, he brushed him and they had a good life.</span> <span id="s579">They never had to work.</span> <span id="s580">And my brother did it so he made a checking account and another account and put money into it, so they never had to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: That's very thoughtful.</span> <span id="s582">That's very thoughtful.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Because they came out of -- they came to Seattle when my daughter was born and they came and they never had to ask for money.</span> <span id="s584">They never had to ask for anything.</span> <span id="s585">So they were very fortunate because there were very few people who were independent with enough money.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: That's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: And my brother always put money in the checking account and when the account got less, he put more in.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: That's a good son.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: There was never any question.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: It's more than money.</span> <span id="s591">It is also a sign of love and respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s593">And I was, how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s594">My sister-in-law, her mother came from Shanghai and she asked, I went to dental school and I was dental assistant.</span> <span id="s595">She asked me if I would take care of her mother because she doesn't speak English, she doesn't -- and so forth.</span> <span id="s596">I say, what do I have to do?</span> <span id="s597">I don't do housework.</span> <span id="s598">She said I don't have to do housework.</span> <span id="s599">So we went to our Palm -- our house was in Palm Springs, but it was too early to go to Palm Springs.</span> <span id="s600">It was too hot.</span> <span id="s601">So we went to Asheville, North Carolina at the Grove Park Inn and stayed there for three months at the Grove Park Inn.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So this lady that you were taking care of, was this your future mother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: This was somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: It was my brother's -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Future sister-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Nobody's mother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">BY

got it clear, that the lady you were taking care of was your brother's future mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s625">That's who she was, because Hilda eventually became your brother's wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: And they met when they were five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: That's
