Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Barbara Mikowychok-chuk(ph) Syska. I’ll repeat that. Mrs. Barbara Mikowychuk(ph) Syska, on October 22nd, 2014, here at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. And I’d like to start out by thanking you very much to come to speak with us today. I appreciate the time that you’re going to take, and the experiences that you’re going to share. As I explained a little earlier, we start our interviews from the very beginning. We’d like to learn a little bit about your pre-war life, your family, the world you were born into, and so on. So I’ll start with the very basic questions. Could you tell me the date you were born, your name at birth, and where you were born?
