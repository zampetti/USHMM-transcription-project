to see you.</span> <span id="s15">Te – was – was your name Maurice Friedberg when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: So it didn’t change at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: No, it du – did – it did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Did you have a middle name?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: There are no middle names in eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And what – when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was born on December 3rd, 1929 in Rzeszów, which is a large city in between Kraków and what used to be either Lviv, or Lvov, or Lemberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: But you – you weren’t raised there, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: No, I was raised in Jaroslaw, which is a city on the San river, again between Rzeszów and Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: So it’s fairly near Rzeszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s30">And how come you were born in Rzeszów and then went to Jaroslaw, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes, because my mother wanted to give birth in the city where my – where her father and mother and other relatives were.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Which was Rzeszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s35">Tell me a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s36">Tell me about your relationship with your father and your mother.</span> <span id="s37">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s38">I mean, not when you were a baby, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: But I mean when you were a little bit older.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: When I was a little bit older, we used to spend – spend summers with Grandpa in Rzeszów, and I had another grandfather in Jaroslaw, who was the grandfather on my father’s side, and the rest of the time – time, we lived in Jaroslaw on the San river.</span> <span id="s42">And it was a normal, middle class Jewish household.</span> <span id="s43">Moderately observant, I would not say strictly observant.</span> <span id="s44">And my father had a lumberyard, and they also manufactured some bricks, and they built small houses with those bricks and with other building materials that were available.</span> <span id="s45">And that’s the way – and that’s the way my childhood is remembered in my mind.</span> <span id="s46">The business that my father ran was very much like the business that my maternal grandfather ran.</span> <span id="s47">It was a middle of the road, not very large, not very small, but old enough and large enough to provide them with a livelihood, and that’s the way I remember it, by September 1, 1939, which was the day when Nazi Germany attacked Poland.</span> <span id="s48">And my first wartime memory is –</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Can – can we – can we go back a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Ju-Ju-Just bef-before – before the war.</span> <span id="s52">Because your brother was born in 1932, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: That is correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What was your relationship with your father like?</span> <span id="s55">Was it – was it a close relationship before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: It was – it was a reasonably close relationship with my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s57">And my mother was the stricter of the two, and my father was the one that you always would run for shelter and assistance when my mother was getting too tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And what ki – how tough did she get?</span> <span id="s59">What – wha-what did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Well, she wou – she would slap me on my behind, or she would take away some privilege, or – or some special kind of dessert food.</span> <span id="s61">And this was, again, quite common in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: So you ran to your father to get protection?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And did he protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: He usually did.</span> <span id="s66">He would tell her to take it easy, or it was really not so bad, you know, so what do you want from him, he’s only a boy.</span> <span id="s67">Things of that kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And was this rather typical in that – in households that you remember, that the mother was much stricter than the father?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes, I remember it as being exactly that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s71">And did you have meals with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: And wou – three meals?</span> <span id="s74">Did your father come home for lunch?</span> <span id="s75">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: My father did not come home for lunch, he would take – he would take some sandwiches with him to work.</span> <span id="s77">So I remember him at breakfast and I remember him at dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And did you have conversations at dinner –</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: – or was it very quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Th-There were conversations, but nothing very exciting or very important, because after all, I was at the most, nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: And my younger brother was two and a half years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s87">And was this – you s – you said that your mother was somewhat religious, was the household very religious?</span> <span id="s88">Were you kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, we were kosher, but being kosher did not consi – it was not considered being strongly religious, this was the minimum religiosity that was expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Did you go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, we went to synagogue quite regularly with my father and grandfather, and I even remember where we sat in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: To the right side of the – of a – the place where they kept the Torah scrolls.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And this was an Orthodox synagogue, so the women were separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: There were no – there were no non-Orthodox synagogues in that part of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: They were all Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s99">So did you wear a kepele?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s102">And were you – did you wear – did you have payos as a young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: You weren’t Has-Hassidic.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I did not have – I did not have payos, and I attended a state Polish school in the morning, and a moderately strict cheder in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s109">And the regular school that you started going to when you were – did you start when you were five or six years old?</span> <span id="s110">A: About that.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: And did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: You liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: And you went to a regular school, or did you go to a private Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: No, I went to a regular state school.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s118">And did you have a lot of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Not that many, but I did have a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And were these friends Jewish, non-Jewish, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Most of my friend were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So the – the – where you lived, was it mainly a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: That’s correct, it was predominantly Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s125">And what sort of a home did you have?</span> <span id="s126">Did you have a house, or did you have an apartment, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes, we had an apartment, and I even saw that apartment after the war, when we visited Poland, and I remember the address, it was the Slovaski(ph) Street, house number 14 on the second floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Mm, so you were on one floor, the – of a house, and someone else lived below you?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No, someone else lived beside us.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And when your brother was born, was this a difficult time for you, or were you happy to have him – an-another sibling?</span> <span id="s133">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s138">Do you remember if politics were discussed at all, so that by the time the Nazis attacked in 1939 that you were expecting this, did you hear things?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: We heard things, we were expecting things.</span> <span id="s140">It was not unusual, and it was not at all uncommon for politics to be discussed at the table.</span> <span id="s141">So that when the Nazis attacked on September 1, 1939, it did not come as a surprise.</span> <span id="s142">And my first memory of the war was a Nazi airplane flying very low, and somebody living in the same apartment building jumping out of the house with a small revolver, the kind of – the kind that ladies would have in their bags, and he shot at that plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Right.</span> <span id="s145">And it was to me a symbol of futility of resistance, because there wasn’t a thing that this pla – that this shooting could do to the plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So even at such a young age you thought that?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s149">But i-in – in 1939 in September, your father was already in the Polish army, is that correct?</span> <span id="s150">So his –</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Right, he was in the Polish army – he was in the Polish army because there was a call to arms, you know, asking all eligible males to present themselves at this, that and the other place.</span> <span id="s152">But as it turned out later on, they didn’t even get to provide them with uniforms, let alone with arms, when the Polish army was crushed by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So where yo – you went with your mother and your brother, an-and – and was – did you go with your grandparents to Tarnopol?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, no, because they were in Rzeszów, and we were in Jaroslaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: So one morning a couple of Nazi soldiers and local collaborators appeared in – in our apartment and they gave us five minutes to get ready, and they deported us on the other si – to the other side of the San river, which was to become the Soviet zone of occupation, as distinct from the German zone of occupation, which they decided to make free of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: So you were deported, this wasn’t – this wasn’t a decision that was made by your mother to – to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: That’s correct, that’s correct.</span> <span id="s159">And I remember we arrived at the bridge on the river, and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor.</span> <span id="s160">There was a – a roadside – a roadside sign which says in German, nach Palästina, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s161">And we were just – we were just pushed to the other side of the river, and then the Germans returned to their side of the river, and we were on the other side for a few days, and it was not clear what those few days will bring, and where we will end up.</span> <span id="s162">I remember we stopped in this small Jewish town, and my mother wanted a place where she could wash me and my kid brother.</span> <span id="s163">And it turned out that the only place where you could get washed was the local mikveh, the religious bathhouse where – where women would immerse themselves after their periods, to make themselves again clean.</span> <span id="s164">And in that little town, it was a town with a single industry.</span> <span id="s165">The industry was making twittel(ph) – making the phylacteries that observant Jews used for prayers on their hands, on their arms and on their forehead.</span> <span id="s166">And then a few days later we met my father, who was looking for us because the army, the Polish army disintegrated, and the – there was absolutely nothing else for him to do.</span> <span id="s167">And there were people roaming around looking for deported relatives and friends.</span> <span id="s168">And that’s how – and that’s how he found us.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Did he know that you had gone to Tarnopol?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No.</span> <span id="s171">But he figured it out because that was the only relative that we had on that side of Poland.</span> <span id="s172">And so he went to Tarnopol, and so did we, and that’s where we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So, you were not deported to Tarnopol, you were deported over the San river.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: And – and then you had to figure out what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: I mean, your mother had to figure out what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: That’s right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And those few days that you spent pr-prior to going to Tarnopol, were they terrible?</span> <span id="s180">I mean were there – were there a lot of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Oh, there were a lot of people, but they were not terrible, because there were no shortages, and whoever lived in that area would try to share with us some food or whatever else was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: So, when you were sent over to the San river, that – that – you were walking, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did you have a little backpack – not a backpack, but a knapsack with you or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s186">So would have – so you would have some laundry to change into.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: And I think an extra pair of shoes or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Right, but you couldn’t carry anything very heavy, clearly, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No, no, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Did your – did your mother carry some food with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: A little, but not much.</span> <span id="s193">Again – again, it was some bread and cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s195">And, did you walk to Tarnopol then?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And were there – you had relatives there, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: My mother’s sister lived in Tarnopol.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: So that’s where we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And you went there and you stayed there in – in their home?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: We stayed in their home for several months until the deportation to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So it was just a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Just a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So you get there in September, and you leave –</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: And we left next spring, when the – the Russian authorities asked all the refugees who came from the other side, who expressed their preference, the preferences being to remain a Soviet citizen and stay at Tarnopol, or to go back to the places from which they were ejected by the Nazis, which is what we chose to do, because that’s where most of the family was, in Rzeszów, and some even in Jaroslaw, because not all of us were deported of the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s208">So you wanted to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: We wanted to go back because we wanted to be together with the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s211">But this was a ruse by the Russians –</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s213">And one night they appeared in my aunt’s apartment, and they read our names and they said, you will have your wish carried out, and they took us to the railroad station, put us in cattle cars, and we were supposed to go to the other side of San river, but instead when the train began to move, it became obvious that we were moving in the direction of east, rather than west, and east was Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s215">We – let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s216">What – what was it like for you on Tarnopol?</span> <span id="s217">Was this a difficult time for you, or was it okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: It was okay.</span> <span id="s219">It was not very difficult because there was no – there was no strict rules about behavior or buying or selling food.</span> <span id="s220">So, you know, th-there were a few rules, which were not terribly strictly observed, until they put us in those cattle cars and begun to move in the direction opposite to the one that we expected to be moved to.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s222">So it wasn’t – so – so you – did your father work during that period of time in Tarnopol?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: He did.</span> <span id="s225">Where did he work?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: He – he worked on behalf of the authorities examining state property to make sure that nothing would collapse, or burn down, or get stolen.</span> <span id="s227">But again, this was a very pro forma kind of arrangement, which was supposed to change into more perm-permanent one, until – until we were sent to those cattle cars, and until the train began to move east.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And your brother was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: My brother was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did – did you have s-separate roo – I mean, ha – what were your accommodations like when you were staying with your – your mother’s sister?</span> <span id="s231">Did you have separate rooms, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, no, we – the accommodations were, I think we slept in the kitchen, and they slept in the bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s234">So they had a small home.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s237">Did your father get paid for this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: He got paid some, in the form of food rations, military rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s240">Now, your mother didn’t work, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s243">And what was your – the husband of your mother’s sister, what work did he do?</span> <span id="s244">Was he under the Russians also?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: He was under the Russians also, and he tried to get some government approved work, but they didn’t get around to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Were you, by the way, as a – I mean, now you are 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s249">Or 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: 10 – te – 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s252">Were you frightened about going back to Poland, or did you not think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I didn’t think about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: You didn’t.</span> <span id="s255">So, was there talk about what the Nazis were doing, what the –</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No, the Nazis were not doing –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: They weren’t doing much.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: They were not doing much that early in the game.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s260">So nobody was that afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s263">Okay, so the Russians take you, they claim that they’re gonna send you back to Poland, but they don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: So they send you east instead of west.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: And where do you – and what’s the – what’s the train like?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: The train was, oh about 15 or 20 car – cars filled with people, and locked.</span> <span id="s269">And inside you had a hole so you could pee in – in it.</span> <span id="s270">But other than that, again, there was nothing special, except that they distributed a little water to drink, and a little bread to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Were you fr – was this a frightening time for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes, it was already, because we didn’t know where we were – where we were going, and why we are being sent there, and what we have to do once we arrive.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And you’re – and you’re with your – your brother and your mother and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Were you also with your mother’s sister and her –</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: They had se –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Because – because she was considered a Soviet citizen –</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: – without any question.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s282">So she could stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s285">Do you – do you remember your parents being nervous?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes, of course they were nervous, but so was everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: And the assumption was that whatever happens to the rest of us will happen to us, and we can do nothing to change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s290">So do you remember how – about how long the trip was in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: The trip was about – the trip was about – close to two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yes, because very often we would arrive at a junction, and they would just leave us there for a day or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Outside of the cattle car or inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No, inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Inside the cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So are they giving you food every day, and water a little bit, or nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No, they would give us a little food and a little water every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s301">So you were – you must have felt as if you were starving, in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: And was the cattle car filled with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: So there are no seats.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No seats.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: So were you sitting on the floor as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You were.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Were a lot of people sitting on the floor too –</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: So there was enough room –</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: – so that people could actually sit, if they felt like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Well, th-they could sit, but not if they wanted to lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s320">Did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: But it must have been very noisy, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: It was extremely noisy.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: – and smelly.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: And smelly, and nobody knew where the hell we were going, and why.</span> <span id="s326">And for how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: [indecipherable] nobody said anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Nobody said a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s330">So two weeks of this, and then where do you end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: And we ended up in what was then Sverdlovsk province, which is now Yekaterinburg province after they changed the names back to the pre-Soviet ones.</span> <span id="s332">And they – and I actually saw the barracks, which still stand there.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I mean, I was there – I was there after the end of the Soviet regime.</span> <span id="s335">So we went to the – the Yekaterinburg province, not too far from the large city of Tyumen, and within that, there was a lumber procurement barracks, and that’s where I got – they left us.</span> <span id="s336">They got us all together and they said, you’ll be working here on procurement of lumber for the needs of the Soviet state.</span> <span id="s337">And you better get it in your mind that if you work hard, we’ll feed you.</span> <span id="s338">If you don’t work hard, we won’t feed you, and then you’ll starve to death and we’ll bury you here, because there is plenty of room for all of you, and that is the way it is with people who are trying to resist the needs of the Soviet state.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: And who was this that spoke to you?</span> <span id="s340">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s342">I even remember his name.</span> <span id="s343">His name was Skavaroatnikov(ph) which literally – which literally means the spatula and frying pan.</span> <span id="s344">He – he was – he represented the authorities, more directly authorities of the – of the NKVD, which was the Soviet secret police.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s346">Now, when you were – you were brought into barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: And is that where you lived as a – you lived as a family there?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: We lived as a family, plus a-an older brother of my mother’s, who was deported with us because he was – he was in with us together in Tarnopol at her sister’s.</span> <span id="s350">So, my father went to work immediately to next day, and this uncle of mine, being a traditional Orthodox Jew, decided that he’ll first s-say his prayers.</span> <span id="s351">And as he was saying his prayers, the KGB or NKVD or secret police commander came in, took out a watch from his pocket, and said there is no way you will get to work on time.</span> <span id="s352">So we are going to send you to a different camp.</span> <span id="s353">And they send him to a stricter camp – camp, with a solitary, with common criminals.</span> <span id="s354">And he was beaten there by the common criminals, so much so that when he came back, he was insane.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: This was Ephraim?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Ephraim.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Okay, we’re gonna have to stop the tape at this moment so they can change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: So we’ll get back to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Let’s go back to Ephraim for a moment.</span> <span id="s363">Do you – do you re – you remember Ephraim from Tarnopol, and then the – on the ride to Sverlovsk – Sverdlovsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: And how did you find out what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: We – we did not find out.</span> <span id="s367">He returned from that solitary, I think, where he was beaten severely til he lost his mind.</span> <span id="s368">And I remember there was a psychiatrist among the inmates, and he talked to him, and he shrugged his shoulders, and he said, there’s nothing I can do for him here.</span> <span id="s369">And he went out one day and he never came back.</span> <span id="s370">And we never found out what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: What happened.</span> <span id="s372">And how did you find out that he had been beaten?</span> <span id="s373">I mean, did you meet people who had been in that other camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: And do you – do you know the name of that other camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Was it ir – Irkutsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No, Irkutsk – Irkutsk was when my – where my grandfather from my mother’s side was, in the place called Bodaibo, b-o-d-a-i-b-o, which, believe it or not, I heard about again a few days ago, because a woman who was not a Polish Jew, and who was brought to this country with her son, who is a professor of mathematics at Brown University, and who calls me because she speaks no English, and had nobody to talk to.</span> <span id="s379">She said that she lived not too far from where the deportees lived.</span> <span id="s380">And the – she knew that the deportees from Poland lived in this camp, not too far away from them, but she could do nothing for them, and she heard that ultimately they were allo – allowed to go back to Poland after World War II.</span> <span id="s381">And she was asking me whether there is any way to find a woman who was her friend.</span> <span id="s382">And I said, I don’t know of any.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s384">So you have no idea – Ephraim was not in the same camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: – as – as the grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: No, grandfather was several thousand miles to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s389">So he was closer to your camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: – as – I see.</span> <span id="s392">But – and where was Aaron, who was the younger brother, was he with your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: He was with my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s395">I guess I was under the impression that – that Ephraim was with him, but that’s not the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And did you – did you find out about Ephraim when you were in sv – in Sverdlovsk, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: What did you do in Sverdlovsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: My –</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s405">I attended school.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s407">A: Yes, it was a school with one teacher, and children under, I think 12 or 14 were allowed to attend school.</span> <span id="s408">So I was in that school and so was my kid brother, and I remember I was worried about my kid brother getting us all into trouble, because he got – he got a primer which had on page one, the portraits of Lenin’s wife, Krupskaya.</span> <span id="s409">And since he found the classes boring, he adorned Krupskaya with a moustache and a few other parts of masculine rather than feminine – masculine rather than – than feminine appearance.</span> <span id="s410">And I was sure that this little notebook would be requisitioned and then they’ll start to figure out who must have put him up to it.</span> <span id="s411">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And that would have been you?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: And that would have been me.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: I didn’t do it, and they didn’t look for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: What was the school like?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: The school was a little hut with wa – with two rooms.</span> <span id="s418">The lower room was the one that I went with, and my brother, and the other room was for somewhat older kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: And was this a very ideological school?</span> <span id="s420">Was it communist?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Oh yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s423">So did you – would – were you taught about Lenin and Marx?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">No, I don’t think Marx.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: But Lenin.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: But Lenin, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Did you hate it?</span> <span id="s429">Or did you find it interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No, I found it boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Boring?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Why was it boring?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Because a – it was just presented in a boring way.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s436">And did you have other subject matters, other than –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yes, they taught – they taught arithmetic and I think geography.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Arithmetic and geography and nothing else?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s441">And did you have homework?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s443">You know, we – we had say four pages of mathematical problems, asking for the results.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s445">And when you were living in the barracks, was it a little bit like a small apartment, or was it not like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: It was a little bit like a small apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: And did you have an inside bathroom, or an outside bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Nobody had an inside bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s450">So there was an outhouse in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s453">And was there some running water inside the apartment, or not even that?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No, not even that.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: So where did you get water from?</span> <span id="s456">Was there a well?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: No, I think there was a spigot outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Do you’d have to bring in the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s461">And your – your mother didn’t work, or she did?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: She did.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And do you remember what she did?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: She did, I think – she was peeling potatoes, which were then cooked and which was the main source of nourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: And was there a common kitch – I mean, a cafeteria?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Is – no, you – you ate in – in your own barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Barrack room.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: So, wh-what would happen then?</span> <span id="s472">The – some of the food would be rationed and given to each family, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s474">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s475">If there were three of you, you got three potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s477">So your daily ration was potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Right.</span> <span id="s479">And – and a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: And it – and it was there that malnutrition resulted in me getting the jaundice.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Can you explain what that was like?</span> <span id="s483">What is jaundice?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Jaundice is a – an illness caused by malnutrition, and you – the sign i – of it is that the whites of your eyes turn yellow.</span> <span id="s485">Now the whites of my eyes turned practically brown, because I did not have the kind of food or medication that you use to treat jaundice.</span> <span id="s486">And for entertainment I will go outside the barracks because a few people there were to dig a grave for me.</span> <span id="s487">And so they would try and do it on the warmer days.</span> <span id="s488">You know, they would start the fire, and then the soil that was under the fire was warm enough for digging.</span> <span id="s489">Well, they never got around to burying me.</span> <span id="s490">I managed somehow to escape death, but the result of the jaundice is something that – that I had for years and years later, because the art – the jaundice that was not cured, resulted in problems with my – what is – what is the – wi-with-with ma – problems with – with my li-liver, and th-the other thing which – gall bladder.</span> <span id="s491">So there was enough of damage done – done to those two things so that years later I was exempted from military service, because of problems with liver and with gall bladder which require a special diet and medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s493">And what was the effect, besides the – the physical effect of your – your – the whites of your eyes going brown, what was the effect of the jaundice on you?</span> <span id="s494">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, it was – it – it – it gave me intermittent gall – gall bladder and – and liver fever.</span> <span id="s496">And that was it.</span> <span id="s497">And the assumption was that if you didn’t take care of that with medication and proper diet, you would die.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s499">But you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: But I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: So you went outside to watch these people digging a grave for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Then wa – what did you say to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Nothing.</span> <span id="s506">You just watched them.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I just watched them.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: And I remember – and I remember in the first few days after the Nazis entered Jaroslaw, Hitler came to see how Jaroslaw under the Nazis managed to live.</span> <span id="s510">And the – and orders went out that on such and such a date, under the penalty of execution, nobody was to be close to a window.</span> <span id="s511">And – but I – but I was not going to obey this order, because there was an important thing for me to ascertain.</span> <span id="s512">The important thing was that when the Nazis s-scream heil Hitler, whether Hitler will scream heil ich.</span> <span id="s513">And Hitler did not scream heil ich, he replied heil sieg, you know.</span> <span id="s514">Long – long live victory.</span> <span id="s515">And that was it, and nobody caught me, so I did not face penalty of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: And we were in that camp on the border of Siberia, in the Urals until a few days after the attack of Germany on the Soviet Union, which was June 22, 1941.</span> <span id="s518">And overnight, they decided that we should no longer be confined to camps, but we should be allowed to live outside of camps, except only for specific large cities and military objects.</span> <span id="s519">And so they told us to get the hell out of the camp.</span> <span id="s520">And since we were all freezing in those camps, the decision that was made immediately was that whatever it is, we shall try and escape Siberia, the Urals and go to a warmer climate.</span> <span id="s521">And I remember somebody got a map, and on this map we circled those towns where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s522">And one of those towns was Jambol.</span> <span id="s523">Jambol which right now has reverted to its pre-revolutionary name, Taras.</span> <span id="s524">Jambol himself was a – was a folk singer specializing in obsequious odes to Stalin and all his henchmen.</span> <span id="s525">Now, the name of – of Taras is the one that you may have heard the last few days here, because it was the name of the – of the [indecipherable] who lived – who lived on the other side of the frontier between the U.S.S.R and China, where they still live.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s527">Let me go back to Sverdlovsk for – for a minute.</span> <span id="s528">Was it cold all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Not all the time, but a lot of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: A lot of the time.</span> <span id="s531">And did you have proper clothing, or you didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: No, we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So it was extremely uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: It was extremely uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Was it very snowy and icy?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: No.</span> <span id="s539">The snow once fell, and stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: That was it.</span> <span id="s542">I saw this after the collapse of the Soviet regime, when I went to Omsk in Siberia.</span> <span id="s543">We stayed in a hotel, and th-there was steady – there was snow the height of – of five foot eight, five foot nine, and nobody ever tried to clean it.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And did you have that same kind of situation –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: – when you were – when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: So how did you get out of the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Because they would dig up a – enough snow so that you could go out one by one.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: So you could go out in line, sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Was this a bad time for you in Sverdlovsk, that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes, it was a bad time because we were all starving.</span> <span id="s556">And also because we didn’t know what the charges are against us, or how long we’ll – we be there.</span> <span id="s557">But we were lucky because the war all of a sudden made us into allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: And we were allowed to go to Jambol.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s561">Were you – when it – when you were in Sverdlovsk, did you get any communication from relatives in Poland?</span> <span id="s562">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: We got a few postcards, which were sent from German occupied Poland, but not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: So you didn’t know very much about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Did you hear rumors, do you remember, as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We heard rumors, but we were not sure whether the rumors are correct.</span> <span id="s568">One rumor that reached us was that Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, because the Soviets were afraid that Trotsky may offer some valuable assistance to the Germans, and they really expected the Germans to attack the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes, even though – even though the official line was that the Germans are our – are our allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: But what you know from history is that Stalin was – was – seemed not to be wanting to hear this.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: So that – because the army was not really – were not prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: He had – he had just decimated his own army.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Did anyone else in the family get jaundice, do you know other people that got jaundice, wer – wer – or did you think you were the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I thought I was the only one.</span> <span id="s577">But I never heard of anybody else getting jaundice.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: You didn’t.</span> <span id="s579">But that’s a typical disease from starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And a lot of people were not eating well.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: So it is a little surprising that you’re the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: But maybe I wasn’t looking for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: May – maybe there were a few –</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: – you know, two or three doors in the other direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s592">But no one in your family.</span> <span id="s593">Your brother didn’t get it and your mother and father didn’t get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: No, no, I – it’s not contagious.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: No, I understand –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: – they – they also didn’t get it –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: – from the – from the food that they were eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Did you lose a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh yes, I lost a lot of weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s604">Were you very tired from – from not eating so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: So you weren’t growing very much, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: No, I was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s609">When – who took out the maps?</span> <span id="s610">I mean, where did they get maps from?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I think they got the maps from some drivers of – of lorries, who had the maps.</span> <span id="s612">I don’t think they got the maps, I think they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: They were borrowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: They were borrowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s616">And the decision to go south – and a lot of people went south, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Now how did you go to ja – Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: By cattle cars, the same way as we arrived in Yekaterinburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So, did you have to pay for these, or it was – were – did –</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: I don’t think we had to pay for these, because we didn’t have any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: But they just gave us a certificate saying that so and so was released from this and this camp by the authorities in accordance with the lo – with the rule – with – with the decision of the council of ministers on such and such a date.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s625">And the rush – the Soviet Union, the – they didn’t care where you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Well, they did care, but we couldn’t go west, because that’s where the Nazis were.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: So we went – so we went from where they [indecipherable] Siberian railroad, which went only one way.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Which was south.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Which was south.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s632">So did – did a lot of people go to Jambol from this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Hundreds?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I would say so.</span> <span id="s638">And a few of them are still in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: They are?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: This was a very long trip, I would gather –</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: – because the distance seems to be ex – really long.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: It’s very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Here, let me get you – here.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s648">Here.</span> <span id="s649">There we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: And in Jambol you also have other deportees from other places, quite a few from the Caucasus, where the Germans were advancing and the Soviets were deporting native s-speakers of languages of the Caucasus, because they were sure that they would greet the arrival of the Germans with joy.</span> <span id="s653">And so they dumped them in the same Jambol.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: So it’s a big mixture of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: A lot of Jewish deportees from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Oh yes, a lot of Jewish deportees from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: What did you eat on this train trip?</span> <span id="s659">Did you have food?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: We had some food, which we exchanged on the way, from local population.</span> <span id="s661">You know, we would – we would exchange a watch for a loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s663">Was this as – how long a trip, do you remember?</span> <span id="s664">Was more than two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: No, about two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Now, was this the same kind of cattle car, were there no seats, and everybody’s standing or sitting on the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: That’s correct, that’s correct, except that this time there were no – there were – there were no guards with rifles on the ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: So you weren’t frightened in the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, because we were told that we are now free, whereas the first time they didn’t tell us if we are free –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: – and we were – we were guarded by po – by police.</span> <span id="s674">And this time there weren’t any guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Were you afraid that the Nazi movement into the Soviet Union would come south, or you didn’t think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: I didn’t think about it, and it was far, far away, and the news we were getting from war communiques provided no clue of the direction or success of German penetration of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s678">So in some ways you were going south in ignorance, you – you –</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: You knew it would be warmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes, and that if you are – if you – if warmer, there – there is a little more food because you have food from what was grown the previous summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s683">I’ve just been touched, so let’s – let’s cut the film, and we’ll change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Do you remember the countryside that you saw on the way on the train, or do – were – or were there no windows, or where there’s a little slat in the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I remember some, but not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Uh-huh, so you didn’t look much?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And you were pretty short.</span> <span id="s691">It would have been tough to get up there, I would suspect.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: That’s correct, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: So when you arrive in Jambol, what – what is it like?</span> <span id="s694">You get off the train, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: And you look for a place to live.</span> <span id="s696">And so one place that was very popular was called Torgsin, spelled t-o-r-g-s-i-n, which is an abrogation of trading with foreigners.</span> <span id="s697">It was a Soviet institution that would exchange valuables that foreigners may have had, for things that you couldn’t otherwise get, such as food, such as clothing.</span> <span id="s698">And so there was a flourishing black market of people trying to get those things that they could exchange later for food or black market.</span> <span id="s699">Did I make it clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: And th – that’s one thing, and the other thing was finding quickly a place to sleep, to – you know, you – we – we arrived there in the fall, which was not very cold, and we were looking for a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s702">And of course, the locals, who could – who could provide a place to sleep wanted to get paid in either gold or valuables that could be exchanged.</span> <span id="s703">And so we found one place to sleep with a local Kazakh who had – who was starving.</span> <span id="s704">And I remember he was starving, but so was his dog, and he didn’t have anything to give to the dog, and the dog ultimately died of hunger.</span> <span id="s705">And we lived in an extra room that he had in his house, for a while.</span> <span id="s706">And the way – and the way we lived is that my – my father would get somebody who would give him things that you can exchange for food or – or other necessities.</span> <span id="s707">And I went to school.</span> <span id="s708">There was a normal Russian school there, which was run by the Siberian railroad – si – siber – Siberian – Si-Siberian Central Asian Railroad.</span> <span id="s709">And so I went to that school, and again I was starved.</span> <span id="s710">But you had to go to that school because there was nothing else for me to do.</span> <span id="s711">Occasionally I would help my father by c-carrying on my person, those things that he thought would be very dangerous if found on his person.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Like golden coins from pre-Soviet era, or golden wedding rings and sa – and such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: And – and where did he get those things from?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: From people who wanted to be paid in – in – in food and clothing and other necessities.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: So he would make the exchange and bring them back?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: And how would he be – how would he then be paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: By getting a certain percentage of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s721">And when did you get cured of jaundice, before you went to Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And it – it didn’t come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: As far as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No, as far as I know, no.</span> <span id="s727">Except that – that I had the gall bladder problems and liver problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s729">And you had them then.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: And – and how did they manifest themselves?</span> <span id="s732">Were you in pain?</span> <span id="s733">Did you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I was in pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: You were in pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: But there was no medication to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: And there was no medication.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s740">So that must have been very tough, you were a young kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: That’s right, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s743">Were you at home a lot because of the pain, so you couldn’t go to school, or did you go in spite of the pain?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: I went in spite of the pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: And was school a little bit more interesting here, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Because you had teachers who were professional teachers, and there was a wider variety of – of subject matter, and also there was – the school had a library, so I could get some books from the library and then exchange them for other books.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s750">And did you talk about school when you came home and talked to your parents, or no – or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So, were you much more interested in school than in some ways your parents were?</span> <span id="s755">Were you very different from the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s757">Well, they didn’t expect the school to be of any interest to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s759">So did you still eat breakfast and dinner with your – your parents, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: No, I ate – I ate not breakfast and dinner, but whenever food was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: So there wasn’t a normal –</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: – meal thing, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So that wa – and, was the food again mainly potatoes, or was there – was there a little bit more variety?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: There was a little more variety and wha – there was also some dried fruit, which didn’t exist in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s768">And that was tasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: And that was tasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s771">Did you sing songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: What kind of songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Any songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: They were popular songs then?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Do you remember any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Not offhand.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: No?</span> <span id="s780">So I can’t get you to sing, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Did you sing songs in Sverdlovsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Because there weren’t enough people to sing them with.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s787">So there wasn’t a little choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Was there a choir in school in – in Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: On and off.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: On and off?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Well, you’re not going to be very helpful on this score, I can tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: No.</span> <span id="s796">Did people get other diseases, like typhoid and malaria?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Did your mother and father, or were they okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: They were okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: And you didn’t get malaria or typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: But you do know people who did.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: And did Simon, your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: So you were – you were pretty much disease free, except for the pain that you had from the aftereffects of jaundice.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Was there anti-Semitism that you remember in Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: There were.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Violent anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Well, it means that they would beat up people they thought were Jewish.</span> <span id="s818">They will say that we will not rent any living quarters to Jews.</span> <span id="s819">If Jews offer something for exchange, it means they are going to cheat you.</span> <span id="s820">Jews don’t get drafted into the army, which was not true.</span> <span id="s821">Things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: So was this dangerous for you to walk on the streets and go to school?</span> <span id="s823">Were you beaten up?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: You were.</span> <span id="s826">Did you fight back?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Not much, because it was always a few of them and me alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s829">So when you were walking to school, you were not necessarily walking with a group of – of people, you were walking by yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: No.</span> <span id="s831">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So what did this make you feel like as a kid?</span> <span id="s833">Did you – did you think it was a terrible thing to be Jewish, or you –</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: And did you say anything to your parents about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Was of no use.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Because there was nothing they could do?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So, were you attending synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: There was no synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: But you were Bar Mitzvahed in Jambol, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes, but it was not a synagogue.</span> <span id="s845">It simply – we simply got together in the quarters of a pious Jew, brought a loaf of bread and a bottle of vodka, and he had a Torah, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: That’s the Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: That’s the Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Did you drink vodka?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: So what did you think of this, if you thought it was a terrible thing to be Jewish in a way –</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: – because you were being beaten up, what did you think about being Bar Mitzvahed?</span> <span id="s853">Was this a good thing, in fa – in your eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: That was a good thing because it was the thing to do if you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s855">And since being Jewish was not a matter of choice, you may as well do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: So you didn’t have any questions about doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s859">And did your brother get bat – Bar Mitzvahed in this period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Oh, he wasn’t old enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: I guess in 1945 he would have been 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: So did you go to school throughout the period –</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: – until 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: The last year and a half, they organized a Polish school in Jambol.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Right.</span> <span id="s871">And the Polish school was allowed to receive some support from [indecipherable] in the form of – of grits or – or some other thing that they could cook, and they could give you a portion of it for lunch.</span> <span id="s872">And in this respect it was better to be a student in the Polish school than in the state Russian school.</span> <span id="s873">The Russian school did not enjoy any special privileges and the Polish school did.</span> <span id="s874">And also the Polish school was about 90 percent Jewish.</span> <span id="s875">So, you know, you did not expect to be mistreated for being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s877">So, who started this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: The Polish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: The union of Polish patriots, then in Moscow, which was the – which was the original name of the communist Polish government that was being there organized in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: So the – you still had classes about communism and Lenin?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: But not – but not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I mean, you know, the – the classes about communism and Lenin were replaced by classes that tried to teach you Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Were you speaking Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: So you were getting advanced Polish or –</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: – when you read – were you reading Polish literature then?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s894">So did you like that school better?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: And that – the kids who were in the school, they became friends of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Some of them did.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s899">And are – was it mainly the people who lived near – near you, were – were – you were friends with them, or what?</span> <span id="s900">Or not necessarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: I would say not necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s903">So what did you do with other kids, when you had friends in Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: You exchanged books.</span> <span id="s905">Occasionally you could exchange some edible thing.</span> <span id="s906">For instance, you could – you could buy at the marketplace dried fruit, like you could exchange it for other dried food.</span> <span id="s907">But there wasn’t very much that you could do.</span> <span id="s908">There are no – there were no activities that depended on you and that would be available to you, but not to others.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: So you didn’t play games?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Or sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: So when you look back on it now, does it feel like a deprived childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: In comparison with what?</span> <span id="s916">With kids that you know now, your grandkids?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s919">So does that make you sad?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: That’s just how it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: A guerre comme a la guerre.</span> <span id="s923">It was war time.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s925">Were you getting any information about what the Nazis were doing once they attacked Poland?</span> <span id="s926">Because now they really are starting to kill Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s928">But – but they would not – they would not spread the news because they did not want to be accused of fighting for the sake of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: So the Russians would not – the Soviet Union would not say anything about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Would – did – did you still get any communication from Poland, from relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: No.</span> <span id="s934">So did you assume something horrible had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: You – you as an individual, or you as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Me as a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: And did you question your parents and say what do you think is going on, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Cause I knew that they could not tell me anything that was not public knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: You were a pretty precocious kid, weren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Was that a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: No.</span> <span id="s946">But by then we already knew that it’s a question of time before the Nazis are defeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Did you assume that they would be defeated quickly?</span> <span id="s948">A: Not quickly, but that they would ultimately be defeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Why did you think that?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Because they failed in their blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s951">They failed in their attempt to defeat rush – Russia quickly, and since they did not defeat Russia quickly, they began to have doubts about the ultimate defeat of Russia.</span> <span id="s952">And so – and then by the second part of the war, they already knew that the Germans are being pushed back, and wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So you – so you knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: You were in Jambol for a very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Did you get used to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Well, sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: But you – you and your family expected the war to be over so you could leave, I gather, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: That’s correct, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: But you – you remained in school from ’41 to ’45, so you were there for four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: And did you go from class to class so that your – your classes became more complex, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Went from class to class.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: And what’s your relationship with your brother like?</span> <span id="s966">Do you – are you very protective of him, do you remember?</span> <span id="s967">A: My brother died some years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: But when you were in Jambol, he was – Simon was – was there with you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: So were you protective of him in Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s972">Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: So you weren’t very close to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Is that partly because he was younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s978">Were there a lot of bugs where you were living?</span> <span id="s979">Did you have to fight off bedbugs and things?</span> <span id="s980">A: Yes, but not that many.</span> <span id="s981">I mean, not unusually many.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Were you stateless?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: In Jambol.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: In Jambol we were stateless because they no longer recognized the Polish government in London, and the government in Moscow was not yet formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: So you’re under – are you under nobody?</span> <span id="s987">But the – but the Soviet Union runs Kazakhstan in some way, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So are you under the Russians, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: So even though you’re stateless, you – you are being controlled in some way by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Did you think about – did your family – you were – you were too young, but di – did your family think about leaving Jambol before the end of the war?</span> <span id="s994">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: No, because there was nowhere to go before the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: So you certainly were not going to go west.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Well, th – you couldn’t go west because the Germans were still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s999">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Once the Germans began to leave what was previously the Soviet Union, we began to think of going back to the liberated territories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1002">But that’s already towards the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1005">What did you know about Ander’s Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Ander’s Army was a Polish army that was organized in the Soviet Union, and many Jews tried to join the army, but they were not accepted by the Poles, they didn’t want this to be a Jewish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: So only some Jews got in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Only some Jews got in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Did your father want to go into that army or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: No, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1012">So he – he was going to stay out no matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: And did he continue to do this bartering throughout the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1016">This kept us alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Because he was able to get some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Some food, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1020">Did you move from place to place –</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: – in Jambol?</span> <span id="s1023">You stayed in that – in that – in that place of that guy who had the dog?</span> <span id="s1024">Or had you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: No, we – we moved to another place, which was closer to the Polish school, and closer to the bazaar where you could look for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: And was that a bigger place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: It was a somewhat bigger place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: But again, no running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: No running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: And an outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1033">Now when – when you were living in Jaroslaw, your – your position was a higher one in terms of economics, right?</span> <span id="s1034">So yo-you had running water inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: And did you have a ba – you had a – a bathroom, an inside bathroom as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: So you were living, in terms of class, you were in – you were in a higher class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1040">But so was everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1042">Was this very difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: No.</span> <span id="s1044">Not particularly.</span> <span id="s1045">You got used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1047">And did your relationship with your parents change at all during this period, as you’re getting older?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Are you reading a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: In Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: I was reading a lot.</span> <span id="s1053">Whatever was available, I read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1055">And what was available to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Classical Russian literature, translations of western literature.</span> <span id="s1057">Modern literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: And the translations, into Polish or into Russian, what were you reading?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: The translations were all into Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1061">And you became fluent in Russian there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: In za – in Jambol, or in s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: In Jambol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: In Jambol.</span> <span id="s1066">There’s a lot of closeness between the Russian language and the Polish language in a certain way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Well, they’re – they are both Slavic language.</span> <span id="s1068">They are as – as close as French and Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Which isn’t that close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Which isn’t that close, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1072">But you – you had an – a fairly easy time as a kid –</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: – learning languages.</span> <span id="s1075">But in Kazakhstan, did they speak mainly Russian, or is there a ca – a language called Kazakh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: There is a language called Kazakh, which is close to Turkish.</span> <span id="s1077">And they taught Kazakh in the Russian school, but they didn’t take it seriously, just as Kazakh independence was not treated seriously.</span> <span id="s1078">I still remember one poem, of Jambol [indecipherable], which went as follows [speaks foreign language here].</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Can you translate that, sort of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Sort of, that we – we sing the praises of our soldiers who are the defender – the defenders of our nation.</span> <span id="s1081">And while we sing their praises, we also sing the praises of the great Russian nation.</span> <span id="s1082">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: That’s it.</span> <span id="s1084">And you learned this in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: I learned this in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Does this – y-you’re smiling.</span> <span id="s1087">Is it surprise you that this is the one poem that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: No, it’s surprising that – that I remember any poem.</span></p> <p><span

to the same extent.</span> <span id="s1096">And translations of western literature, be it 19th century, say Mark Twain, or 20th century, like Jack London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: But there was nothing unusual about that.</span> <span id="s1099">I would say that most – most kids read the same books.</span> <span id="s1100">We read whatever books were allowed to be given to us by the library.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Because reading was really the primary occupation that you could –</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: – you could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1106">So that was true of most of the kids that you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Okay, we’re gonna change the tapes now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Was there a bazaar on a marketplace in Jambol?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yes, there was.</span> <span id="s1113">There were two of them.</span> <span id="s1114">One was called the – [sneezes]</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Bless you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Thank you.</span> <span

Lemberg, or Lvov.</span> <span id="s1174">And then to cross into what would be again an independent Polish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: And so where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: This exactly the way we went.</span> <span id="s1177">We had somebody who sent us – some distant cousin of mine who sent us a request to join him in the Polish [indecipherable] of Poland, and on the basis of that, we got railroad tickets and we went in that direction.</span> <span id="s1178">And we got as far as Lvov or Lviv, and then we cross into Polish territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: And did you end up in Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: And what was Kraków like then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Well, Kraków was the one town that was not destroyed by the war.</span> <span id="s1183">It was pretty much like the pre-war Kraków, except that there were hardly any Jews in it.</span> <span id="s1184">Before the war, Kraków was about half Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1186">And did you find out when you crossed into Poland what had happened to Jews, I mean in terms of the murdered Jews, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: We found it out when we arrived in Kraków, but later on we would get more and more details on how it worked, and where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: And – and you believed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Well, if you didn’t believe it, all you had to do was find a cab, which will take you to Auschwitz, which was about two hours’ drive from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Were people going and visiting Auschwitz then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: That was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Which was in ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: In ’45.</span> <span id="s1200">It was – it was a frightening experience, but by then we couldn’t say that we didn’t know about it, because by then – by then they had many trials of Nazis who were caught, you know, and – and the trials very often were translated into radio.</span> <span id="s1201">So could you – you could hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Did you go with your family when you went to Auschwitz, did you go with other kids, what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: No, I went with other kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: And was this a school thing that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No, no, it was a – it was by then a Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1206">There were Jewish kids who were returning from Russia, or Jewish kids who lived through the Holocaust in Poland and survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: And so you decided you would – you would join them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: So – so this was a – a kind of private decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: So tell me what that was like, for you to walk through this.</span> <span id="s1212">Did – was – was there a – a kind of tour, was there anybody guiding you, or you just walk through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: We had somebody guiding us, but I don’t remember who it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: And did you go to Birkenau, or you went to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: So you went –</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: We also went to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1219">So you went to Auschwitz one and then Auschwitz two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: And what was it like then?</span> <span id="s1222">In ’45?</span> <span id="s1223">That’s much earlier than most people ever saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1225">Well, you knew that you were where the horrible things were happening.</span> <span id="s1226">And this was in this barrack, and the other thing was in another barrack.</span> <span id="s1227">And it was difficult to believe then that time would come, and there would be people deno – denying the Holocaust all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1229">So you – when you went back to Kraków, did you then tell your parents what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: And did they go as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Ye-Yes they did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: – but they went separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1236">And did they go because you had gone, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1239">And when they came back, did you then discuss it with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: There was nothing to discuss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: When did you find out what had happened with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Within a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Of coming to Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: And did – did Aaron find you in Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: And how did he do that?</span> <span id="s1248">I mean, how come he went to – was Kraków a place that a lot of people went after Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1250">But also – but also, Kraków was the place where you could get information about other people who got back and where did they go.</span> <span id="s1251">You know, for example there were a few people who were directly to the former German cities in Silesia, but you would find out about them in Krakow, and they would know who went where.</span> <span id="s1252">You had, in Kraków, unlike in the Soviet Union, you immediately had Jewish organizations, and those organizations would try to provide as much information as possible, about the whereabouts of survivors, or liquidations of earlier ghettoes, when and where and how, and so forth, which you did not have in Russian occupied Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: In Kraków, you had a functioning synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: So did they – did they have lists up on walls –</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Lots of them.</span> <span id="s1257">But, you know, people would look at those lists and also append their own queries about the whereabouts of their families, and who went where, and who is likely to have been in this or in that ghetto, or who is likely to have information about the fate of individual persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: You s – you spoke about anti-Semitism in – in Zambor(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Right, in Jambol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Jambol rather, in Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s1261">When you came back to Poland, was there also a lot of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1263">Quite a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: And how did that manifest itself for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Well, there would be Jews who were taken off trains and killed on the spot in po – in 1945 – ’46 in Poland.</span> <span id="s1266">There were Jews who were warned not to come to this place or to that place because they’ll – they’ll be murdered, and quite a few were.</span> <span id="s1267">But it was – it was not very different from anti-Semitism that you might have before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: So it wasn’t necessarily worse than it was after the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: It was the s – it was the same kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: It was the same kind, except that – except that the 1945, the postwar anti-Semitism was made more acceptable because the war taught the Poles that to – that you may kill Jews with impunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: You’re now 16 at the end of the war, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: When you go back to Kraków, do you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1276">I went to one school in particular, which before the war was about one-third Jewish.</span> <span id="s1277">After the war there were t-two of us in that school who were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Was there any sympathy at all –</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: No, none.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: None, about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: And do you explain that because everybody was suffering from the war itself, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: How –</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: No, I think that it was so because by then the propaganda of the anti-Soviet groups spread the word that the new pro-Soviet government is really a Jewish government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: And why do you think they did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: To undermine that government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: So it was an easy way to undermine the government by saying it was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1291">Did you have a weapon that you carried around with you at that ti – at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1293">Yes, I did, because the police would occasionally close its eyes to the fact that the Jews had weapons, because they could not provide them with protection 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1294">So they would say, if you have a gun, we will not kill you for it.</span> <span id="s1295">You know, and – and you could find guns all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: You could?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Is that how you got a gun, you fi – you found it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: And was this a small pistol, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: No, it was a normal pistol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1303">And you carried it in your pocket?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: I carried it under my belt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: And did you go to school with this weapon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: And the teacher didn’t say anything and the students didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Nobody said anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Were they frightened of you, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: And where did you get bullets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Again, you could find them on the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: And you – did your parents know that you had the gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: And th-th-they were fine with this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Did they have one as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: No.</span> <span id="s1321">But that’s the place where the pogroms began.</span> <span id="s1322">You know, there was one pogrom that never took place, because we were told that there would be one.</span> <span id="s1323">And so we organized a defense organization.</span> <span id="s1324">And I remember that before Passover 1946, I went out of the house where the Jews lived, and I saw a carton with something in it.</span> <span id="s1325">So I walked over to it to see what it is.</span> <span id="s1326">And I saw a newborn child cut into little pieces in that car-carton.</span> <span id="s1327">And I took the carton away with a couple of other kids, and we hid it.</span> <span id="s1328">And within minutes, there was a large group of local people looking for something.</span> <span id="s1329">They were obviously looking for that carton, but finding none, they went back and disappeared.</span> <span id="s1330">And this was the – the pogrom that never was realized in Kraków.</span> <span id="s1331">But an-another gos – pogrom in Kielce did take place, and there were about 70 or 80 Jews who were killed in that pogrom.</span> <span id="s1332">And there – there was – and that – there was a press conference in the – with – with the – with the archbishop of Kraków, and I went to that press conference and I heard one journalist ask, is it true that the Jews use Christian blood to make matzoh?</span> <span id="s1333">And his eminence thought for a minute and he replied, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: I really don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Was – was the fear of pogroms what made you and your family leave –</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: – Poland all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1340">The fear of pogroms, and the fear that Poland is going to be a Soviet state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: And why did the second thing frighten you, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Because we didn’t want to be – to live in a country that would be like Jambol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1344">And was this discussed with your parents, or did they just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: – say we’re going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: They said we are going, they said, we don’t want to be the last Jews alive in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1349">Was it easy to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Yes, because the Polish government wanted the Jews out, because they were a se – a security drain, and also because they knew that the Jews will be an excuse for anti-Soviet, anti-communist activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: What do you mean that the Jews were a security drain, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: That they would have to assign so many policemen to protect the places where the Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: So they were not unhappy that the Jews wanted to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Did most Jews leave, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: I would say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: This is where the refugee camps began to be organized in the American zone of occupation in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1360">But you and your family did not go to Germany, did you, you went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: No, we went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: And how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Somebody told us that if you go to France, you’ll find it easier to go to America, if you have relatives in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: So in 1946 you go to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: And is that in – in the summer, or in – in the end of March or something, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: The end of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: It’s the end of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: So it’s a little chilly in Paris at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Yes it is, but it’s not – but it’s not Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1373">Now one – once you wer-were in Poland, were you able to get more clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: I mean, di – di – so you – when you went to France, you had more things with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: And was it easy to get a place to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: In Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: In Paris we were helped by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: They assigned us to hotel rooms, and they provided us with one meal a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: And was that the big meal, or the smallest one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: It was – it was a big meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1386">And there must have been a lot of refu-refugees, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1388">And it was in Paris that – that I learned how to speak Yiddish properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Because there were Jews from all over Europe, refugees, and Hungarian Jews did not understand Polish, and neither did Romanian Jews.</span> <span id="s1391">But the lingua franca for all of them was Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1393">So who taught you Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Some Jews from those countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: So you became fluent in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: So I became fluent in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: So now you’re s-seventeen years old and you have Russian –</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: – Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: – Kazakh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Not quite, but some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Some.</span> <span id="s1404">And Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: And Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: So we only have three or four languages to go, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: And you learned French?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: So that’s the fifth one, so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: And what is it like in Paris right after the war?</span> <span id="s1413">Is it – is it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Well, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: – difficult situation, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: It’s difficult, because you could not get a working permit, because the French suffered from unemployment.</span> <span id="s1417">So they would allow Jews, refugees, to work only in three or four professions, where there was no unemployment.</span> <span id="s1418">See what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span> <span id="s1420">So – and that wasn’t a great number of spots, I would gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1422">But we were all waiting for the opportunity to leave France for the United States or Canada.</span> <span id="s1423">I mean, there was no state of Israel yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1425">But did – would you have gone if there had been a state of Israel, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Maybe, I’m not sure, I’m not sure, but I think maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: But Aaron, your – your mother’s brother, the only brother who’s alive, goes to Palestine, or goes to Israel.</span> <span id="s1428">Goes after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Goes – goes to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: So after the – the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: After the proclamation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: After the proclamation of the Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1435">So is your father working at all during those two years while you’re in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: He’s not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: No, because there was no – there was no work where you could get a job where you were allowed to work.</span> <span id="s1439">So we were just waiting for the opportunity to get the hell out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: So that’s difficult, it’s two years like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Yes, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Do you go to school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: You – you – so you’re continually going to school [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: I am continually going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1447">And what do you study in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: French, French history.</span> <span id="s1449">Whatever.</span> <span id="s1450">Current events, things like this.</span> <span id="s1451">But again, it was not clearly defined, because the country was not back to normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1453">But it is interesting to know that in all of these situations, there is schools available for kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Even if it’s – they’re not the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1457">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: But it was such schooling that provided with some modicum of continuity –</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: – with the pre-war situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: So that’s very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Now did you know kids who were in school from previ – from other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Or are these totally new kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Both.</span> <span id="s1469">Are some of them your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: So is there more to do in Paris for you as a chi – as a seven – you’re not a child any more really, but I mean, you’re a teenager –</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1473">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: – you’re 17 years old.</span> <span id="s1475">Is there more to do, or is the situation so bad because of the ravages of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: No, I think because of the first.</span> <span id="s1477">But again, there was no clear line of demarcation between the two.</span> <span id="s1478">And there were always rumors, you know, that within a week, they will allow Jews to leave for, say Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1479">Which they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Except that you were allowed to go to Venezuela, provided you lied about your religion, with the connivance of the Venezuelan government, which allowed only white, Christian immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: But they knew that people were lying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: They knew that people were lying, and – and the train to where the boats for Venezuela were, were paid for and organized by the Jewish organizations from America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Now when you get to Paris, do you very quickly try to get visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: We did, but that was of no avail, because visas were usual – usually given to categories of people rather than individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: And what were the categories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: The categories were those who lied about their religion, and who lied about their economic status, or what they could contribute to Venezuela.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: And – but you immediately applied to go to the United States, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: We did, but they told us that this takes time.</span> <span id="s1490">So do you want to leave now for Venezuela or await better luck with visa applications to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1492">And you decided to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1495">And you had to wait two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: It’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Yes, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1500">And during this whole period of time, the Jewish Joint is – is giving you folks one meal a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: One meal a day, and they paid our rent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: And they paid your rent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1505">We’re going to have to stop the camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Dr. Friedberg, where did you live in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: We lived in two hotels that were practically taken over by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s1510">One was on Rue de Roi de Sicile, the street of the king of Sicily, which was in a section known as Le Marais, Metro Saint-Paul, between Bastille and – and the – and the Louvre and Rue Rivoli.</span> <span id="s1511">And then they moved all of us to Rue Gambai(ph), which was almost on Place de la Republique, which was also taken over by the Jewish organization, which placed there its refugee clients.</span> <span id="s1512">Seven Rue Gambai(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Tell me, do you – do you remember whether your mother got really depressed after she found out what happened to the family, or weren’t you aware of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: I was not aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: So she didn’t talk about it much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Did she talk about it later, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: She didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: No, she didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1522">Did your father lose family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1524">Lots of family, but again, there was no visible signs of depression on his part.</span> <span id="s1525">But this was quite common, and one reason was that the news of the slaughter of one’s family came at the same time as the news of the hora – restoration of the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1526">So one would more or less eradicates the extreme impression of the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: You – you don’t think that the personal loss was greater than the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Euphoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Yeah, of – of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: I – I think it was, but one canceled out the others.</span> <span id="s1531">There was not enough of an intermission between the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1533">The Marais district in Paris is mainly Jewish, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Yes, it was mainly Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: And that’s probably why the Joint was there in the first place –</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: [indecipherable] first –</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: And there were also some synagogues there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: In France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: So was this different for you to live in a place where there was no overt anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: And was this significant to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s1549">But then it was the – my first encounter with a non-Soviet state, you know, where the police did not just round up and shoot people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: And that’s what you were used to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: – in Kazakhs –</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1554">I mean, for the first time, I – I met a state where the sight of a policeman did not immediately result in fear of being arrested and – and – and mistreated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: And do you th – was that true for most people in – in France at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: And the French had a very big s – record in treating Jews during the Nazi period.</span> <span id="s1559">So it was not unusual for them to – to claim that the Nazis did what they di – what they did, but not because of the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Right, that the French didn’t help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1563">Did your parents learn French?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: A little, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: So they – so you were – you – you became the communicator, I guess, in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: I became the communicator.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1568">And did Simon le – learn French, because he was a little kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1571">So you – the f – well, let me ask you this: why was the decision made not to go to Venezuela?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: I think partly it was my doing.</span> <span id="s1573">I said I don’t want to go to a country where I have to lie in order to be allowed in.</span> <span id="s1574">And the – and the argument sounded realistic enough so that they said, all right, we’ll wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Was that a hardship, to wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: It was – it was a hardship, but not a starvation hardship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1578">Waiting is just difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: But finally, in December of – was it December of 1948 that your – your parents and your youngest – your young brother left –</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: – to go to New York, and you’re alone from December until the spring, you’re alone for three or four months, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Was that difficult for you to be alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Because you could be free?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Was that the first time in your life that you were that free –</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: – not having family of anybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: So what did you do that was different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s1598">I still attended school, and I would go to museums and theaters and whatever I could afford, cause I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: But you oh – go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: And I rather enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: But you were not working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: But I was not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: So where would money come from?</span> <span id="s1604">From the Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Money was from the Joint and from my parents, who used to send me packages consisting of Pell Mell(ph) cigarettes and chewing gum, which – which I would – which I would sell on the black market, and live on the proceeds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Was there a lot of black market [indecipherable] yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Oh yes, plenty, plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Was it more black market than it was anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1613">So you sold the cigarettes and you sold the che – the chewing gum was a big item?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: How come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: You don’t know.</span> <span id="s1620">Cigarettes I s – I un – I understood, because people liked to smoke, but I didn’t know people were chewing gum so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Oh yes, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1623">So you remained a very serious kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Were you dating at all when you were in Paris?</span> <span id="s1626">Were you seeing young girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Was that new for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: More or less, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1631">And di – would you take girls to the museums, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s1634">And were there movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Did you like movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: What did you like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: I remember I saw for the first time Charlie Chaplin in “The Great Dictator.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1641">What’d you think of that movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1644">It’s a great piece of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1647">And did you see westerns from America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Yes, but I didn’t care for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Oh, you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Why, cause they were too violent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: No, because there wasn’t much to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1654">Do you remember any other movies, besides Charlie Chaplin that you liked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: No, nothing – nothing very memorable, but some American movies, for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Did you fall in love in Paris, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1659">You just went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: I just went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1662">So you came to the United States in the spring of 1948, or December.</span> <span id="s1663">December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: I think – I think December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Did you want to go at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: And were your parents living in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: So, was that sort of a shocking place to go to, this huge city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1676">Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: On the lower east side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Where a lot of people ended up, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1681">What was that like then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Well, the way the lower east side probably looked like on the eve of World War I.</span> <span id="s1683">You know, there were traditional Jewish institutions, and Jewish – Jewish synagogues and little stores, and small – small Jewi – Jewish theaters.</span> <span id="s1684">I saw – I saw Murray Schwartz, and Menasha Skulnik and people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1686">Do you remember what street you lived on in the lower east side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Yes, I lived on Fifth Street, between Avenue B and C.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: And was this in a tenement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: In a rundown building, not necessarily a tenement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1691">And your father was working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: And what was he doing now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: He got a job in a men’s clothing factory, which provided him with enough of an income to buy food and to pay rent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: And what he doing in that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: He was a shipping clerk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1698">So it was very different from what he was doing when he was in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1701">Was this hard on him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: It was not easy, but he didn’t complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1704">Did your mother and father get along well?</span> <span id="s1705">Did they have a good marriage, as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: As far as I know, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1708">And your mother didn’t work at this time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: – she stayed home again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1713">So did – when did you start learning English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: After I arrived here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: That was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: And did you go to school very quickly?</span> <span id="s1718">You start – you came in s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yes, immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Even though you didn’t know English at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: So what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Well, it was rough, but I convinced myself that that’s the only way to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1727">So, did you learn English as you were sitting in class and trying to figure out what people were saying –</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: – or did they help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: They didn’t help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: They didn’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Did they realize you didn’t understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: I’m not so sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: So there were no special classes in English –</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: – like English as a second language, nothing like that, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: So how long did it take you to learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: A year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: At least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: At least.</span> <span id="s1744">So, did you finish high school in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: And what made you go on to graduate school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Well, because I felt that what they taught in high school was far too easy, so I wanted to get higher education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1749">And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Brooklyn College.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: And you got a degree in – in what there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: In organic chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Organic chemistry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Well, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1756">So you got a master’s degree in organic chemistry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: I didn’t finish, so I moved to Columbia, and I entered the department of Slavic and east European languages.</span> <span id="s1760">And that’s where I got two master’s degrees and one PhD.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Now, are you living at home during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: And are your parents surprised that you’re going on and getting such a high degree, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: They’re not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Not at all, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: But neither of your parents had that much education, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1769">But they were not surprised that I wanted to get higher education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1771">Did you want to teach, or you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: No, I didn’t know what I wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: You didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: So getting a degree – a PhD in Slavic languages, did that appear to be a very practical thing to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1778">So what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: But I managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: You then taught, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: I then taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Wa – did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: What’d you like about teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: The fact that I could talk and everybody else had to shut up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: You really like that, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1789">Did you – did you ever have discussion classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: But I was never very good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1794">So did you teach at Columbia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: While you were a student, or were you – you were a professor there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: I was a professor for a short time and then I taught at Hunter College on 68th Street and Park Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: And after a few years there, I moved to Indiana in Bloomington where I taught also for 10 years.</span> <span id="s1800">And after 10 years of that, I moved to Illinois, where I taught until I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1802">And was that the best place that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Is that why you moved, because you thought it would be – each place would be a better place for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: And did you en – you enjoy doing the research and writing your books more than you did the teaching, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: In spite of the fact that if you spoke, the students would have to listen to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: You wanted something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Were any of your books more important to you than any others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1814">But I published a great deal, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: – it didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1818">Tell me something, wh-why do you think at this point in your life, you’re willing to speak about your experiences during the war, and you haven’t been willing to do that before, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Well, the number of people willing to talk about their wartime experiences keeps dwindling.</span> <span id="s1820">We are dying off, one after another.</span> <span id="s1821">And so I think that, if they feel about it the way I do, they will start speaking, before it’s too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: And why do you think it’s important to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: To preserve the historical record.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1825">Do you think people are not going to believe that the Holocaust happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Well, there already are quite a few people who don’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Is it uncomfortable to talk about it, or – or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Not uncomfortable, provided I speak to somebody like you.</span> <span id="s1829">But, you know, occasionally I get people who – who will tell me in effect, I understand that you were gang-raped.</span> <span id="s1830">How interesting.</span> <span id="s1831">Tell me all about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: They say something like that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s1835">And do you – do you question them and say, where do you get such an idea from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1838">What do you – what do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: I just don’t talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1841">You know that your story is an unusual one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Because it – it appears that the people who have been emphasized in doing oral histories, are not the people who went east, but who stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Yes, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: And who came under the Nazis, which you fortunately didn’t, even though you cle – you and your family clearly suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: So it’s a – it’s a bit of different story, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: No, I agree, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1850">Well, I want to thank you for being willing to speak with me, and the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: We’re very grateful.</span> <span id="s1853">Is there anything more that you would like to talk about that you haven’t – we haven’t talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: No, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: Well, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1859">Thank you for having given me an opportunity to talk about things that I thought I was preserving.</span></p> <p><span
