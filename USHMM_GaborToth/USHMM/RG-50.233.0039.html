speaking with Monique Goodrich in Brookline, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s4">Ms. Goodrich, could you tell us your name at the time of the war, your date of birth, your place of birth and anything you possibly can about your family background and your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">I was known as Monique Jackson.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Paris, France.</span> <span id="s7">I was born in October 29, 1937.</span> <span id="s8">My parents-- my father's name was Charles, he was born in Russia, in Vesitosk (ph) (c.10); my mother was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s9">They both emigrated to France when they were young.</span> <span id="s10">My father did some studies.</span> <span id="s11">They were both orphans of the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">So they met in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">They met in France, yes.</span> <span id="s14">They were pretty young when I was born, l I guess.</span> <span id="s15">My mother was twenty years old when I was born.</span> <span id="s16">My mother never really had a good family.</span> <span id="s17">She was raised, I guess, by her sister.</span> <span id="s18">Jeannette, who is dead now, told me that she is the one who took her out of the orphanage because her parents died during the war.</span> <span id="s19">I think typhoid.</span> <span id="s20">So my mother never knew her parents and she was raised by her grandmother, by her sisters; she was shunted back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">All in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">In Poland and in Paris.</span> <span id="s23">My father was more or less the same.</span> <span id="s24">He came from a large family and he has more recollection of his parents but he was also orphaned during the war and didn't know his parents.</span> <span id="s25">No, he knew them a little bit, he knew more his oldest sister, I think he knew.</span> <span id="s26">Her name was Emma; I think she raised him.</span> <span id="s27">But he lost his whole family except for a brother that was left in the United States.</span> <span id="s28">That's one of the reasons we did come to the United States, because his brother was here, Sam.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">You don't know anything about the religious background of the family or anything, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">The religion?</span> <span id="s31">My father certainly was well-versed in religion.</span> <span id="s32">He knew the prayers, there must have been some orthodox.</span> <span id="s33">But he didn't practice.</span> <span id="s34">He gave up the religion, certainly.</span> <span id="s35">I don't know if it was before the war or during the war but I think he gave up all religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">When he was in Paris, you said he was studying.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">He did study some engineering, I think he did, for a while, but then he ran out of money and he had to go to work.</span> <span id="s38">He told us lots of stories of how--I guess there were a group of them--they used to run out of money and how they used to try and get the baker to give them some money and how they would take the herring and split it so they could have something to eat.</span> <span id="s39">Lots of stories like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Do you know anything about your parents' basic education.</span> <span id="s41">Did they go to public school system there?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">My mother went to public school.</span> <span id="s43">My poor father, he didn't know really, Russian.</span> <span id="s44">He studied in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s45">I don't think he knew Hebrew but he studied in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s46">His mother tongue was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s47">His mother tongue was Yiddish and he could write Yiddish.</span> <span id="s48">Everything else was very difficult.</span> <span id="s49">Languages didn't come very easily to him so he came to France, had a hard time with French and when he became a little fluent in French, he went to Spain.</span> <span id="s50">He ended up in Spain during the war, in a camp there.</span> <span id="s51">So when he became a little fluent in Spain, he came back to France.</span> <span id="s52">From France, we came to this country.</span> <span id="s53">My poor father was always speaking in all kinds of different languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">I see.</span> <span id="s55">That's interesting.</span> <span id="s56">What can you tell me about your home?</span> <span id="s57">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s58">Were you extremely young?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Before the war, I do not remember anything because I was two years old when the war started.</span> <span id="s60">My earliest recollections are of the little town in the Pyrenees in the south of France in the Medii, Neichtauber called St. Laurent De Neste.</span> <span id="s61">This is where I spent quite a few years of the war.</span> <span id="s62">Those are my earliest recollections.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Since you can't tell me first hand, can you tell me what happened and how you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">In 1939 when the Germans crossed over to France, the family started to go--they wanted to go to the free zone of France.</span> <span id="s65">My mother--I forgot the exact story how it went--but she knew someone or somebody told her to go down to the Pyrenees and I think the government helped the mothers and the children to escape.</span> <span id="s66">They escaped, they ended up in the Pyrenees with quite a few members--her sister was there with her family.</span> <span id="s67">There were about some twenty persons, I think, some Jewish people who were in that particular town, in that little town, ended up in St. Laurent De Neste.</span> <span id="s68">I talked to her last night, she mentioned that they were strafed when they were escaping and they ended up in that small town.</span> <span id="s69">They took the train and they ended up--it was about maybe twenty or thirty miles from Towl (ph) (c.62) which is the biggest city.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">So when you got there, did the individuals hide people or, what happened exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">The French, if you recall, had a corroborating government.</span> <span id="s72">Life was very difficult but the town itself was very helpful.</span> <span id="s73">My mother always tells the story how they used to make little baskets down there.</span> <span id="s74">My mother says I used to go off into this little town and I would come back.</span> <span id="s75">Somebody would give me a basket they would put eggs in there or milk and really keep my mother supplied.</span> <span id="s76">They were extremely helpful; vegetables--.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">There wasn't a huge shortage in these areas, or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Not when I was with my mother.</span> <span id="s79">I don't remember being hungry, no.</span> <span id="s80">It seems that the town really helped my mother and my father survive; the other people who were there also.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Do you remember what it looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Give me any possible descriptions that you have and be as specific as you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">The town was a beautiful little town.</span> <span id="s85">I remember it; it was imbedded in my mind.</span> <span id="s86">I could never forget it.</span> <span id="s87">As a matter of fact when we went back there, about ten years ago, my husband and I, I took him exactly to where it was.</span> <span id="s88">Because it was in the Pyrenees and because it was so close to the Spanish boarder, there was a sort of like a Spanish flair to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Did they speak Basque there?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Yes, some of the people spoke Basque.</span> <span id="s91">As a matter of fact, I spoke Basque, I learned a tongue down there that was Basque--very Spanish.</span> <span id="s92">But I forgot it all, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s93">The reason I forget it all is because there's a definite southern accent to France.</span> <span id="s94">When we went back to Paris after the war, I was really made fun of so I dropped it as quickly as I could.</span> <span id="s95">It was like all small towns whether they be French or whether they be Spanish, they have what they call a plass (ph.)(c.88) which is the center of the town.</span> <span id="s96">There's usually the churches, the town hall, very similar almost to the American town.</span> <span id="s97">From that plass radiates all the streets of the town.</span> <span id="s98">In the center of town, there was also a building where the people used to put hay.</span> <span id="s99">I remember they used to stack hay there and we used to play in there and have fun.</span> <span id="s100">The smell of hay was just incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">You played with just the regular kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Yes, as a matter of fact, Zhebair(ph) (c.92) was one of them and he is in one of those pictures there.</span> <span id="s103">I found them afterwards.</span> <span id="s104">We had a house that was a three story house, very primitive, actually.</span> <span id="s105">All the houses were built; they were at least hundreds of years old with very, very thick walls.</span> <span id="s106">The main room would be where there would a coal stove and then the bedrooms upstairs.</span> <span id="s107">That's where we lived and on top of the house was a huge balcony.</span> <span id="s108">It wasn't as big as I remember because I was a small girl and everything seemed big but from the top of the balcony, you could see the Pyrenees, the mountains.</span> <span id="s109">It was very pretty, I used to play up there a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Did the people in the town--I assume they knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">I think so.</span> <span id="s112">As you will see, they knew that we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Your brother wasn't born then?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">So you slept---?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Well, as I begin to unfold the story, you will see what happens.</span> <span id="s117">We lived in this little town.</span> <span id="s118">It was in the free zone but it was not really that safe.</span> <span id="s119">We never really knew who was collaborating and if my father would be denounced.</span> <span id="s120">After a while, the mayor, Mr. Couquebert, who had two daughters, helped my mother.</span> <span id="s121">She was friendly with his wife.</span> <span id="s122">The whole family was friendly and he told her that the day they would come for my father that he would let her know.</span> <span id="s123">He had to be very careful because again there was a collaborating government.</span> <span id="s124">As things began to be very difficult, there was in these old buildings, they had, since there was no refrigeration, they had like a closet, a very thick closet where they would keep the goods.</span> <span id="s125">You know, the butter and the perishables and it would keep them quite cool.</span> <span id="s126">My brother was born in '41 so this was about '42, '43 maybe, when it became--my mother didn't want people to know that my father was in the house.</span> <span id="s127">He would stay in the house but anytime anybody would come to the house, he would go into that little closet.</span> <span id="s128">They had put an armoire in front it and he would hide there.</span> <span id="s129">But my brother would call, "Pa-pa, pa-pa" back there, so it became very difficult for him to hide.</span> <span id="s130">Across the street, there was like a barn, nothing like a barn that you would think of now, but like an old building where the animals would be kept.</span> <span id="s131">My father very often would go there during the day or at night and hide there so he wouldn't be home.</span> <span id="s132">My mother tells me that the Germans did come into the town one time.</span> <span id="s133">I was at my little friend's house.</span> <span id="s134">Her father had trucks which of course could not be used that time because they didn't have gasoline.</span> <span id="s135">We would play in the trucks and they had put some swings there and we'd swing.</span> <span id="s136">One day the Germans came in and they routed all the men.</span> <span id="s137">There were some that were Mackee (ph)(c.138), the Resistance.</span> <span id="s138">We were very scared.</span> <span id="s139">I was very, very scared at the time.</span> <span id="s140">They killed, they rounded up and some of them tried to escape and they rounded up the ones who tried to escape, they were shot.</span> <span id="s141">There was the father of the baker was shot dead and a few others were shot.</span> <span id="s142">They put all the men in this la plass (c.141) where I told you where there was a building where people could get together.</span> <span id="s143">They let them go after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Did you have a sense--at this point did you understand anything that was going on, a sense of the danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">There was a sense of danger but I really didn't understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s146">As the hidden children understood, we knew instinctively that we couldn't call attention to ourselves, that we had to be very good and obey and do what we were told to do.</span> <span id="s147">Because after a while, my mother felt that it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s148">She talks about the brown Jews coming around and telling them to hide the children, at least to save the children if they couldn't save themselves.</span> <span id="s149">So I ended up in a convent for a while with the sisters.</span> <span id="s150">That was a very miserable time.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">I was four.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Do you remember this?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Very distantly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Do you want to talk about it at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Yes, I can talk about it because I did go back and visit.</span> <span id="s157">Some of the horror was worked out.</span> <span id="s158">They had an orphanage, they ran an orphanage there and so I was just a member of the children in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s159">It was very, very regimented.</span> <span id="s160">You got up at a certain hour and you went in the chapel and prayed.</span> <span id="s161">You ate at a certain hour and you went to the bathroom at a certain hour and a four-year-old child, it was very difficult besides being away from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">You knew that they were still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">My parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Yes.</span> <span id="s165">Or did you--?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Hard to say.</span> <span id="s167">Hard to say what I felt.</span> <span id="s168">I think what happened is that I sort of withdrew into myself.</span> <span id="s169">The only thing that I remember vividly is having to go to the bathroom all the time and not being able to go and being very, very afraid at night.</span> <span id="s170">Again I would have to go to the bathroom and I was afraid to get up and go.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">I'm sorry we couldn't let you go when you got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">That's okay.</span> <span id="s173">I was scared, I was always scared.</span> <span id="s174">I always knew that there was danger and I didn't know what the danger was.</span> <span id="s175">Being away from my parents was also very--.</span> <span id="s176">You knew, instinctively that there was danger because my father was hidden.</span> <span id="s177">I was shushed, I'm sure, all the time.</span> <span id="s178">There was danger, it was imminent at all times and I didn't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Did the nuns know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">I don't know.</span> <span id="s181">I'd have to ask my mother if they knew.</span> <span id="s182">My mother says I didn't stay very long.</span> <span id="s183">To me, it seemed like a very long time.</span> <span id="s184">But when I back to visit them, to visit about ten years ago, that was the last stop I made because that was the most painful one to do.</span> <span id="s185">That was really miserable.</span> <span id="s186">They understood right away what had happened to me and they proceeding to give me flowers because they had changed the place totally.</span> <span id="s187">It was bright and it was cheerful where it had been stark and dark.</span> <span id="s188">There were flowers everywhere and so they proceeded to show me all the pictures that they had; the children that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Were they the same people?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Not the same sisters.</span> <span id="s191">They weren't the same sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">But they knew the legacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Right, they did know.</span> <span id="s194">So from there, I was there by myself.</span> <span id="s195">As my brother got a little bit older, I think my brother was about a year and a half old, according to my mother the brown Jews or somebody came and said hide your children.</span> <span id="s196">They took us away and my parents weren't supposed to know where and it was the most horrible place on earth.</span> <span id="s197">There were two other children with us that came from the town and I forgot to ask my mother what their names were.</span> <span id="s198">One of them was named Louie, who didn't survive.</span> <span id="s199">He finally ended up being deported anyway, and his brother.</span> <span id="s200">We were at a town, the name I do not remember and my mother does not remember.</span> <span id="s201">We were absolutely--we really didn't have enough food to eat there.</span> <span id="s202">It was the most horrible place; we were constantly punished.</span> <span id="s203">I was punished for losing a barrette; I went without supper.</span> <span id="s204">It was really pretty awful.</span> <span id="s205">My mother had a dream that we didn't have enough food and that we were not well and she woke up my father one night and she says we have got to go get the children.</span> <span id="s206">He says no we shouldn't; she says if you don't come with me, I'll go by myself.</span> <span id="s207">So they went to Taub (ph) (c.196) to the Red Cross who had placed us.</span> <span id="s208">She insisted that they tell her where we were.</span> <span id="s209">They finally did and she came and got us.</span> <span id="s210">I remember she was absolutely so upset when she saw us because we had gotten so thin and--.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">You remember being at this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">This was a home, with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">It was a home, yes, with people.</span> <span id="s215">It was a private home.</span> <span id="s216">It was not an institution or anything like that.</span> <span id="s217">It was a private home.</span> <span id="s218">We went to school.</span> <span id="s219">I remember we had to walk quite a few miles to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Was this your first experience in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">No, because I had started in St. Laurent de Neste in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s222">Maybe, I'm messing up--I think we were in school there, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s223">I remember we used to dig for roots in the soil to see, to eat.</span> <span id="s224">We used to go to people and ask for food, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s225">My mother tells me that the people, when she finally got there to get us, that the neighbors came and told them how happy they were that they came for us and got us out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">What happened from that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">After that, I don't remember if it's this one or the one before--I went on a farm, Labastide it was called and I stayed there also for a few months.</span> <span id="s228">It was in the foothills of the Pyrenees on a farm.</span> <span id="s229">Even as miserable as I was, because how could I ever be happy being away from my parents, I knew that it was a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s230">I could remember walking out in the Spring and having just a field of narcissuses as far as the eye could see.</span> <span id="s231">Because it was the foothills of Pyrenees, the roads were very steep.</span> <span id="s232">Everybody would leave the bicycle at the farm and the only way you could go down was to walk down to the town.</span> <span id="s233">The food was there, it was farm food, but the food was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">So you weren't starving?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">No, I wasn't starving but I was not happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Were there other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">There was one girl.</span> <span id="s238">I found out when I went back: her name was Lahansel (ph)(c.220); she was adopted.</span> <span id="s239">She and I were pretty good friends.</span> <span id="s240">My job, since I was four, five years old, on the farm was to keep the birds away from the chickens.</span> <span id="s241">They had these prey birds that would come down, circle and circle and then come down and pick chicken.</span> <span id="s242">I would stay with a big stick and if I saw them circling, I would start shouting and wave my stick but once in a while, they would get a chicken anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">They wouldn't try to attack you, would they?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Good.</span> <span id="s246">You went to school while you were there, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">No, I didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s248">Maybe, it was during the summer, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s249">I don't remember going to school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Where was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">My brother must have been young.</span> <span id="s252">Maybe I've got it out of sequence because there I was by myself.</span> <span id="s253">When I went to that other place where I told you, where I was so miserable, my brother was with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Were your parents in the vicinity all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">They weren't too far.</span> <span id="s256">When I was at Labastide, it was the sister of our neighbor, Madame Cazeau, this is a picture of her.</span> <span id="s257">It was just a question of saving--according to my mother, it was just a question of trying to keep me away from the house.</span> <span id="s258">In case something happened, that I would be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Do you remember any incidents at this time, Nazis or any bombings or anything, did anything go on at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Bombings, no.</span> <span id="s261">I never heard any bombings.</span> <span id="s262">The only time that I saw them when they would drop their--I can remember; they would come down to the town to Labastide, into the town and they would drop off their bicycles.</span> <span id="s263">I remember being in the five, you know how; these old farms--there's just one big room, with the big fireplace, literally how you see it in Plymouth planation--that's how they cooked on an open fire.</span> <span id="s264">I can remember when the Germans--I could never distinguish the difference between the Germans or the gendarme, the police, whenever they appeared, I would go on the corner of the fireplace and try to make myself as small as I could.</span> <span id="s265">I was always afraid, I was very much afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">I'm sure.</span> <span id="s267">Were there other playmates at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">No, I don't remember any playmates at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">How long--you were only there for just a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">I think it was just a few months that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Where were you afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">I think it was the farm, the Red Cross, the convent and then for a while, instead of sleeping--after a while my mother said if we perish, we perish together.</span> <span id="s273">What I would do is I would not sleep at home at night.</span> <span id="s274">She would send me to the neighbor's house and I would sleep with their daughter, Huni(ph)(c.268).</span> <span id="s275">Again I used to wake up in the middle of the night and I used to get frightened.</span> <span id="s276">I could hear the mice in the walls and I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s277">It was a time of always being frightened and didn't know why.</span> <span id="s278">I think we could feel it from the adults but they never would tell us anything so we really--this fear was not known, was an unknown fear.</span> <span id="s279">Which actually made it worse because we never knew where it was coming from.</span> <span id="s280">My mother got false identity papers from the policeman who was helping her.</span> <span id="s281">At the beginning--my father still talked until he died, about the garden that he had in back of the house.</span> <span id="s282">I went back to see that garden; I could remember it so vividly.</span> <span id="s283">One night, they did come for my father and my mother was told--.</span> <span id="s284">Monsieur Couquebert sent his wife during the day and told her that my father should not be home that night.</span> <span id="s285">He went across, where I told you, across the house and he watched them; in the middle of the night they came for him.</span> <span id="s286">It was no longer safe for him to stay there.</span> <span id="s287">What they did is, I'm sure you've heard of the Basseur, (ph) (c.287) the people who would take the Jews from France to Spain where it was supposed to be safer?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Smugglers, kind of.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">That's exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s290">They took the men and took them over to Spain and my father ended up in Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">What did he do in Spain, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">He was in a camp, what they call a concentration camp, in Miranda.</span> <span id="s293">They struggled but they survived and we were left in the Pyrenees by ourselves with my mother.</span> <span id="s294">What my father used to do in order to earn his living; he worked in leather.</span> <span id="s295">When they would kill the cows, the oxen, he would take the leather and tan it.</span> <span id="s296">He would make pocketbooks.</span> <span id="s297">My bag was _________(c.300) from my father.</span> <span id="s298">As a matter of fact, when I back to this little town ten years ago, this Hunee (ph)(c.302) who I used to sleep with, she showed me and I don't have a picture of it here, she showed me a pocketbook that my father made for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">That's interesting.</span> <span id="s300">So your father got to Spain and then your mother came to the farm and took you out, is that what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Then we stayed with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Still in St. Laurent De Neste.</span> <span id="s304">However, the twenty people that were there with us who--and I wasn't really that much aware of them--I was aware of my mother's sister and her husband in Marcel but I wasn't aware of anybody else for some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">I was going to ask you, did they associate with one another or was it dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">There was a lot of--my mother tells me that they were not very nice to her, as far as the Jewish people that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">I don't know.</span> <span id="s309">They were just cliquish, you know, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Interesting that in every situation that ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">They decided that when it got to be too dangerous and they decided that they were going to Spain, my brother was too young to go, to cross the Pyrenees, so Labastide's basseur (??)</span> <span id="s312">(322) that he would come back for her and we were left behind and everybody left.</span> <span id="s313">As it turned out, this basseur (c.325) worked--what my mother never understood is that the men went first and they made it, he took them there.</span> <span id="s314">But the others, the rest of them, they were delivered into the Germans' hands and so they all perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Oh, G__.</span> <span id="s316">And so by chance you just didn't go with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">We didn't go because my brother was too young to go.</span> <span id="s318">My mother's sister, her husband, when they were in the mountains, the Germans came upon them.</span> <span id="s319">Uncle Jack was behind.</span> <span id="s320">He wasn't with his wife so he went to go with his wife, to protect them and his son and at that point he was shot.</span> <span id="s321">He died right there and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Did the smuggler get killed also?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">He was the--the Resistance got him.</span> <span id="s324">He was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">So they were betrayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">They were betrayed.</span> <span id="s327">He got money from the Jews and he got money from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Wait, he was collaborating with the Germans and the Resistance went after him, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Yes, the Resistance got after him.</span> <span id="s330">His wife, there was a woman there, my mother was telling me last night, there was a woman in the town who arranged all this.</span> <span id="s331">They got after her too.</span> <span id="s332">They shaved her head, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">The Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Was there much resistance activity in this town, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Evidently, there was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Was your mother aware of it?</span> <span id="s338">Did they make contact at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">They made contact with her after the war to see if she could identify any of the people who had betrayed them.</span> <span id="s340">Because at the time when all the Jews left, she begged her sister not to go, to stay with her.</span> <span id="s341">Her sister went and that's when they were put on the train to Auschwitz, she was able to send her that letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">It blew my mind.</span> <span id="s344">When I went back to St. Laurent de Neste and the little town--my mother couldn't remember where my uncle was buried--because I remember when he was shot that my mother and I went to the cemetery to the town, now I know its name is Shaum (ph) (c.359) and we went to place a plaque on his tomb.</span> <span id="s345">They found her somewhere because there was one girl that escaped from the group; she ran and she was able to escape.</span> <span id="s346">She lived with us, evidently, for a little while.</span> <span id="s347">Her name was Rosa Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s348">I remember going with her by train to that little town where we placed that plaque.</span> <span id="s349">When I went back, it blew my mind because I saw that it was just a few days before the debarcation (?)</span> <span id="s350">(c.368) when the Americans went into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">So that was already forty---?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">'44, June 44 when they were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Do you know what year it was then when you were--for example, how many years were you in this town then, for three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">'39 to '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Oh, okay, for six years.</span> <span id="s356">Did you attend school at all then after you came back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Yes, I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">You did.</span> <span id="s359">Were you ever told you were Jewish or anything like that by your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">I remember my father, for a while, that he was trying to teach me Yiddish.</span> <span id="s361">I remember he tried but I guess he felt that it probably would not be the safest thing to do, so he stopped.</span> <span id="s362">For some reason, even though my parents learned Yiddish and I certainly understand it well, I never attempted to speak it.</span> <span id="s363">One thing that I regret immensely, is not speaking Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Well, it's never too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">My son and I, we were going to try and learn .</span> <span id="s366">One time, I remember, I made inquiries to see if we could find--and there was a class but somehow we never materialized it and learned Yiddish.</span> <span id="s367">Do you speak it?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">No.</span> <span id="s369">But now I'm also thinking that I should.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Sometimes, I go down to Florida where my mother and father were and all you hear speaking is Yiddish.</span> <span id="s371">I lament the fact that some day it's not going to be anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Probably not.</span> <span id="s373">Some day soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">It's such a rich language, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Yes.</span> <span id="s376">We should all go take Yiddish.</span> <span id="s377">I have been thinking of it also.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">But you must speak Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Yes, I speak Hebrew fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">That, I envy you because I want to be able to speak it.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">I spent a lot of time there.</span> <span id="s382">Are there any specific episodes or anything from your war time experiences that stand out in your mind vividly.</span> <span id="s383">I'm sure there must be some things that happened or--.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Do you want to hear good things, bad things?</span> <span id="s385">Anything at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Anything, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">l was trying to think of all the things that I remember.</span> <span id="s388">One thing I remember is because we didn't have much food, there wasn't much meat in those days and I can remember my father raising rabbits in one room in that house where we lived and we were overrun with rabbits.</span> <span id="s389">My father couldn't kill one of them for food because they were friendly little rabbits.</span> <span id="s390">I don't think we ate one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">That's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Then I remember there was a little closet outside and we had a duck.</span> <span id="s393">I can remember one time, in absolute awe, I opened the door to let the two ducks out and the little ducklings came tumbling after them, the little yellow ducklings, that was so cute!</span> <span id="s394">I remember the geese used to walk around the town.</span> <span id="s395">There was one place where there were geese and they would run after you and pinch you something fierce.</span> <span id="s396">They were awful, really, really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">That's funny.</span> <span id="s398">They weren't afraid of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">No.</span> <span id="s400">They used them like dogs to guard places.</span> <span id="s401">Oh, yes, they attack and they are very mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">And they can be trained to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">I don't think they need too much training.</span> <span id="s404">It's instinct.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Just give them some food.</span> <span id="s406">That's interesting.</span> <span id="s407">Is there anything else?</span> <span id="s408">Those are nice images.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">I can remember swimming in the town, in the river.</span> <span id="s410">I can remember going to church with my friends.</span> <span id="s411">We used to cut out the wafers for the communion.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Your parents encouraged you to go to church?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Did they go to church too?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">I think my mother attended a couple of times, yes.</span> <span id="s416">I used to do a lot in the church.</span> <span id="s417">Again, the church was the center of the town.</span> <span id="s418">I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">You had a lot of playmates there?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s421">There were all these things to do around the church and so on and I certainlly partook part in all that.</span> <span id="s422">Most of it, though, was terror, fear.</span> <span id="s423">Although after a while, my mother finally decided we were going to stay together and we were together, I think there was less of it than before.</span> <span id="s424">It was always this fear, first of all, that I was going to be sent away.</span> <span id="s425">And I was sent away a lot, even after the war, I was.</span> <span id="s426">It wasn't something that remained just for the war.</span> <span id="s427">After the war, also, that was a kind of betrayal on my parents' part that I was pensioned off again.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">I would like to hear about that.</span> <span id="s429">Do you want finish with the war period and go on to that?</span> <span id="s430">Is there anything else you can--for my purposes, for this project, I'm going to concentrate on the war period.</span> <span id="s431">For the purposes of our interview, I would like to have everything down.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">I'm trying to think of what else you would be interested in.</span> <span id="s433">I know that at one time, my mother tells me and I don't remember that, she was told that she had to leave.</span> <span id="s434">That it was no longer safe for her.</span> <span id="s435">Don't forget that the mayor also was helping us to stay and she was told not to stay there, to leave.</span> <span id="s436">She didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s437">She put my brother in the stroller and took some food with her and she started walking away from the town.</span> <span id="s438">It's not as if you could take a bus or anything like that so she started walking and walking.</span> <span id="s439">At night, she knocked on the door of a farmer and asked if she could stay with her children, she would not make any noise.</span> <span id="s440">I think one of them refused her, she was afraid.</span> <span id="s441">Another one let her stay, I think, in the barn.</span> <span id="s442">The next morning, I don't know how my mother did that, she must have been so frightened, the next morning she started walking again.</span> <span id="s443">I think the second day, this Hunai(c.480) who I used to sleep with, who was my neighbor, she was about 18, 19, she came on her bicycle after my mother and told her that it was safe, that she could come back.</span> <span id="s444">Remember I told you how my father used to work with the leather; he used to take the skin and tan it; there's a whole process that you go through and he would make a pocketbook.</span> <span id="s445">My father tells the story, you know how for the oxen, they used to have a stick with like a nail on the end, they would prick them on the rear end to get them to go faster.</span> <span id="s446">My father used to get mad because they used to ruin it, they would pierce the skin and it would ruin the leather.</span> <span id="s447">He would make the skins and my mother would sell the skins, it was her job.</span> <span id="s448">That was the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Where did he get the cows and the oxen.</span> <span id="s450">That was illegal, or wasn't it?</span> <span id="s451">Where were they provided?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">When they killed the cows, I guess, they used to give my father the skins or he would buy the skins.</span> <span id="s453">He did work for a while too.</span> <span id="s454">He worked maybe as an upholster in _______(c.502), he tells me, I think, he used to go there every so often but then it stopped.</span> <span id="s455">My mother tells me that they managed to--she had money; she was left with some money.</span> <span id="s456">Mr. Couquebert, the one who was so helpful to her, when my father left for Spain, he came over.</span> <span id="s457">My mother says he opened his wallet and he says here, how much do you need?</span> <span id="s458">He was willing to give her whatever she needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">That's very nice.</span> <span id="s460">Was he given some kind of commendation afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">I don't know if he was.</span> <span id="s462">I think that's why--I talked to my mother last night.</span> <span id="s463">I wanted to get the names because I think they should.</span> <span id="s464">He did perish.</span> <span id="s465">He somehow went back to England and got back into the armed forces and he perished during the war.</span> <span id="s466">He ended up being killed.</span> <span id="s467">He certainly should be one of the righteous because he certainly did help us.</span> <span id="s468">I don't think without him, we would have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Could be, good chance.</span> <span id="s470">It's amazing how you found these all these little towns they just went all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">I don't know if you saw the movie that was shown by Bill Moyers on Channel 13, the education-- called "The Weapons of the Spirit".</span> <span id="s472">That you've got to see.</span> <span id="s473">It's about a little town in France called the Chambon.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Oh, yes, I know about the Chambon.</span> <span id="s475">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">An amazing, amazing story and I watched it glued to the television.</span> <span id="s477">The tears just kept coming out because it reminded me so much of that little town, where without them, we would not have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">I want to stop the tape and flip it over.</span> <span id="s479">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">I remember the day that my mother got a letter from the Red Cross saying that my father had made into Spain.</span> <span id="s481">I remember the day that my mother got the letter from my aunt, her sister, that she was on her way to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">You didn't tell me about that on the tape, did you?</span> <span id="s483">Would you like to tell me about please.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">My mother said that when they finally assembled, got assembled to leave where the basseur(c.587) was going to take over the Pyrenees into Spain, they all got together in back of the cemetery.</span> <span id="s485">I remember a woman arriving, I didn't know who she was and she arrived with a suitcase and she asked me a question where my mother was.</span> <span id="s486">I told her where she was and I guess she was one of them.</span> <span id="s487">I don't remember who she was.</span> <span id="s488">She perished also; she went with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">My mother begged her sister to stay and she wouldn't stay and she went.</span> <span id="s490">A while later she got a letter from her that she was in a cattle car so _____to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s491">I remember the day that my mother got the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">How did she--?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">She was walking around in total despair.</span> <span id="s494">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s495">It's only later that I realize what it was.</span> <span id="s496">The Russians came.</span> <span id="s497">There was a bunch of Russians that came also from--I guess they were on their way to Franco, to Spain.</span> <span id="s498">They stopped at our house; my mother happened to speak Russian.</span> <span id="s499">They brought her food, anything she wanted.</span> <span id="s500">They had food and stuff, they brought her in the back.</span> <span id="s501">My mother spoke fluent Russian then--.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">How is that?</span> <span id="s503">She's from Poland though.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">She also lived in Russia for a while.</span> <span id="s505">That's where she learned Russian.</span> <span id="s506">I remember being in Paris during the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">The Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Right.</span> <span id="s509">She finally decided that she had to go back to Paris in order to get my father back from Spain.</span> <span id="s510">We went back to Paris and we lived, I think, with her sister for a little while until my father came back.</span> <span id="s511">She found an apartment.</span> <span id="s512">I remember my father coming back from Spain, brown and looking good with a bunch of bananas that we had never seen.</span> <span id="s513">We became a family again.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">How was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">I guess it was tough for them.</span> <span id="s516">They had lost everything again.</span> <span id="s517">Nothing was left from the old apartment.</span> <span id="s518">Everything was gone, apartments were hard to get so we got an apartment.</span> <span id="s519">They began to try and find ways to--.</span> <span id="s520">Somehow, they got hold of my uncle in this country and I remember, imagine having an Uncle Sam!</span> <span id="s521">.</span> <span id="s522">He used to send us packages with chewing gum and everything you could imagine in those packages.</span> <span id="s523">In the name of--they had to rebuild their lives--we were again sent off to homes by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Was that a common thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Pretty common, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Where were you sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">In the countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A year, six months.</span> <span id="s530">I was very, very ____(c.624), very hard to take.</span> <span id="s531">You could understand, I think, as children we understood during the war that it was inevitable or that it was necessary, but after the war it was--.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Your parents felt that they couldn't function, they couldn't build up as quickly if you were around?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">They did that also even before the war, as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">That's interesting.</span> <span id="s535">Do you want to talk a little bit about the time after the war, when you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">I don't know.</span> <span id="s537">It probably won't be part of the war story so I don't think--I could tell you but I don't think it needs to be recorded.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Then that's up to you.</span> <span id="s539">Some people want it for a sense of completion to tell their entire situation for the purpose of the interview.</span> <span id="s540">If you'd rather not, that's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Only to say that after the war, I was seven years old when I got back to Paris.</span> <span id="s542">We lived in Paris for six years.</span> <span id="s543">Then we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">So you went to high school in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Yes.</span> <span id="s546">I went to Lesane (ph) (c.637), for a year and a half in Paris.</span> <span id="s547">Then I came here.</span> <span id="s548">I started here in junior high school.</span> <span id="s549">My parents, they were born in Poland or Russia.</span> <span id="s550">They came to France, my father went to Spain and came back to France and then came here so it was a constant upheaval for them to adjust and learn new languages and new ways.</span> <span id="s551">It was tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">What about your sense of--once you were reunited and after the war, was there any more sense of Jewishness in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">I certainly knew that I was Jewish when I was in France.</span> <span id="s554">I remember that, we didn't have libraries the way you have libraries here--where you can go into the library and pick any book you want.</span> <span id="s555">So they used to have books, some books in the school that you could borrow and you could pick a book on one day.</span> <span id="s556">They announced a book, some Jewish history or something just before it was my time to pick a book and I remember I picked a book.</span> <span id="s557">I went to some organization, I think my mother made me join some organizations that I enjoyed.</span> <span id="s558">By and large, I think, I didn't know anything about Judaism at all.</span> <span id="s559">I knew more about, since I was in the convent, and all my little friends were Catholic, I knew more about the Catholic religion than I did about Judaism.</span> <span id="s560">It was only when I came to this county, after I got married; I was almost ashamed.</span> <span id="s561">People would ask me questions about the Jewish holidays and I didn't know anything about them, that I began to learn what they all meant.</span> <span id="s562">It's now that I've started to partake in the Seder and different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Did you have a sense, when you were with the Catholic children, that you weren't part of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">I always knew there was something different about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">I've spoken to other people who had that.</span> <span id="s566">They knew they were going through all the motions and everything but said that they knew it wasn't their----.</span> <span id="s567">Would you like to talk about your aunt and uncle who were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">They were--I remember my cousin and he was a brat.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">His name was Marcel?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">His name was Marcel?</span> <span id="s571">I can't remember the last name.</span> <span id="s572">I know that their names are in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s573">I think that's been recorded.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">If you could find that out for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">I'll find out the last name.</span> <span id="s576">It just escapes me right now.</span> <span id="s577">I don't remember, I remember him more than I remember--.</span> <span id="s578">I remember the house they lived in and I have a picture of that.</span> <span id="s579">They lived in the house that my brother was born in.</span> <span id="s580">I remember visiting them.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">In Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">No, in St. Laurent De Neste.</span> <span id="s583">Anything in Paris before the war, I do not remember, I was just too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">How old was Marcel?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">He must have been two or three years older than I was.</span> <span id="s586">He must have been about seven, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Do you know where he was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">He must have been born in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">So he was a brat?</span> <span id="s590">He was rambunctious?</span> <span id="s591">or he was just bad?</span> <span id="s592">or mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">He was mean, yes.</span> <span id="s594">I always felt guilty about saying that since he perished.</span> <span id="s595">But he was.</span> <span id="s596">My mother tells the story of how he wouldn't eat.</span> <span id="s597">You know mothers always have to feed their, especially their sons, their children.</span> <span id="s598">She would take and do every thing for him so that he would eat.</span> <span id="s599">I do not remember that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">You wouldn't know anything about his schooling, or any of his family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">No, I would have to ask my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">If we could find that out for a future point, then we could use his story.</span> <span id="s603">Otherwise, it would be difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Yes, to get it together, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Is there anything else that you would like to tell me that you can think of?</span> <span id="s606">with regard to your particular experience or with any of the repricusions?</span> <span id="s607">That is entirely up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">I can't think of anything as far as the--.</span> <span id="s609">I think, as a child, it was so painful, we were in such pain all the time, that we just didn't--.</span> <span id="s610">It's like not being awake all the time, it's kind of a strange sensation.</span> <span id="s611">It's like if it was too painful, you just forgot, you just didn't remember or you just weren't there.</span> <span id="s612">I don't know what I was thinking of but I don't have the vivid recollections.</span> <span id="s613">There are certain things that are very vivid, like in the convent.</span> <span id="s614">Having to go to the chapel, praying--.</span> <span id="s615">I remember the food, I remember them giving us this hot chocolate made with water for breakfast and hating it.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">What else did you have to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Bread, mostly bread.</span> <span id="s618">That's the only thing that I remember about food--tomatoes, there must have been some vegetables that kids didn't like vegetables.</span> <span id="s619">I remember--as I said, I was so afraid to go into the convent.</span> <span id="s620">It was only at the last, last minute that I rang the doorbell and we went.</span> <span id="s621">The town itself, I can remember walking from my house to where my aunt used to live.</span> <span id="s622">As the picture shows you, there was like a wall in the street and I can remember the sun making shadows on the wall.</span> <span id="s623">I used to be so scared to walk through that, it was like a, what do they call it, a calfule (ph) (c.712), between two streets and oh I used to be so scared, always scared.</span> <span id="s624">I can remember having whooping cough and being very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Was there any way to get medical attention?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">There was a doctor, I remember being treated by the doctor.</span> <span id="s627">I don't know how much they could do but I do remember having the whooping cough.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Do you think that this sense of fear, you carried this?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s630">I remember the night my brother was born.</span> <span id="s631">I was four years old and I remember that.</span> <span id="s632">I tried to think of the town.</span> <span id="s633">I can remember my brother was always being absconded, I always had to go look for my brother.</span> <span id="s634">They used to say, he's in the shirt, in the chemise; they used to make fun of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Your brother lives in America now?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Do you talk to him about the experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Not much.</span> <span id="s639">I really, as I said, never really told the whole story.</span> <span id="s640">I remember the woman in that place, where I told you, where we didn't really have enough to eat.</span> <span id="s641">How she used to walk with her feet pigeon like this and I remember once asking her how come you walk like that?</span> <span id="s642">She says when you get old, you'll walk like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Did you write notes that you'd like to look at?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">These were just notes that I wrote when I sent back to St. Laurent de Neste about ten years ago.</span> <span id="s645">Probably my mother has one, I should get it back from her.</span> <span id="s646">I wrote to her at great length when I was there, sent her some long letters.</span> <span id="s647">At night I would get back to the hotel and I would have to write it down and I probably should get that back from her because that's when I really put my feelings down, very traumatic.</span> <span id="s648">She says she cried when she got the letters.</span> <span id="s649">For a long time, especially during the terrorists, when France didn't want to give the terrorists, I think it was during the Munich thing--.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">The Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">The Olympics.</span> <span id="s652">I got mad at French and as much as I liked the cheeses, I think, for a whole year, I boycotted the cheese.</span> <span id="s653">Then I began to realize, wait a second, how about all the people who had been so nice and without whom you wouldn't have survived so I started to buy cheese again.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Why suffer?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">No, I didn't want them to suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Do you identify with your French roots, or you've really been in this country for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Do I identify with, yes, this is a part of me that's really--.</span> <span id="s658">It's really one of the things that's difficult.</span> <span id="s659">When I go back to France, some of the things, some of the basic things, I speak French fluently, but some of the basic things, sometimes, I don't know how to do, I have to ask.</span> <span id="s660">They look really--.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">You feel silly?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Silly, silly.</span> <span id="s663">People look at me, where have you been, what planet did you come from?</span> <span id="s664">But I do enjoy going to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">I was thinking, perhaps your home was sort of atypical anyway since your parents were immigrants there.</span> <span id="s666">Were they fully French?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">My mother was.</span> <span id="s668">My father, no, but my mother definitely was.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">He had an accent then in his French as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">So he was in great danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">My father was, in more danger than my mother.</span> <span id="s673">It's just amazing that we did survive as a family.</span> <span id="s674">So many, as you saw, didn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Is there anything else you want to tell me for this interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s677">I think this covers it.</span> <span id="s678">Just to make sure that the town does get recognition, that it is written up--all the names of the people, the French.</span> <span id="s679">It was just amazing that without this little town, if they had been hostile, or if they had not wanted us, I do not know how we would have survived.</span> <span id="s680">I don't think there was a way to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">I would like for you to write down these names for me if you could do this.</span> <span id="s682">At this point, I guess, we can stop and I want to thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">My pleasure.</span></p></body></html>
