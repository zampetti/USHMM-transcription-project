Q: This is Eli?
A: Eli, yeah. They give him to a doneschneider. That means a ladies’ tailor. So -- okay?
Q: Yeah, sure.
Q: When I saw my brother, sometimes he comes home he brings some money.
Q: Money.
A: Because back home if you made for a customer something, you take this coat or suit or something to the customer’s home in a big box. Then he went before Shabbos, Friday, then he got a tip. He goes later, nobody gives him money any more. But he brought some tips so I liked that. So I said to myself, I’m going to be a tailor. Again also.
Q: That’s when you decided?
A: Huh?
Q: That’s when you decided. So you stopped going to school and then you apprenticed?
A: Yeah. I went -- my father and mother -- they didn’t go with me to an apprentice like with my brother. I went by myself always. I always was by myself.
Q: Did your parents have other plans for you?
A: Huh?
Q: Did they have other plans?
A: No.
Q: So they were happy that you two were going to --?
A: Before, I helped a little bit so when my father manufactured shoes, I helped a little bit home, to help my father. Then I went by myself to an apprentice, to a ladies’ tailor. And I went to this ladies’ tailor, you know an apprentice, you have to clean the floor, you have to go shopping with them. When they have a kid, you have to raise the kid. It wasn’t so easy. So I would stay for a while and then I said it’s not for me. I cannot learn too much because I have to do other housework. So I looked for somebody else. I looked for somebody else and I did find Yanka Fishman, a ladies’ tailor. This was my in-law.
Q: Future father-in-law?
A: Yeah. So I went to him and I was asking if he needs somebody. He said yes and I stayed there for a while and I got to know this Hameecha, you know what --?
Q: Yes. ______.

A: For Fishman?
Q: Yes.
A: I think I was already nine years old.
Q: Nine years old. You liked it better there?
A: I liked it better but the point was -- Yanka Fishman got the daughter, you know.
Q: Yeah, yeah. You liked this daughter?
A: Yeah.
Q: Pretty?
A: Huh?
Q: Pretty?
A: First of all, she went to school at the time. We start talking -- the only thing was -- not in my in-law’s home but downstairs, Hameecha’s mother, she got that place, an apartment. She got also in the front, a store. So when Hameecha, my friend, I was always there, I was never home. Sometimes I slept there and together from Fishman’s daughter comes down to the tanta.
Q: The aunt?
A: Aunt, yeah. And we met over there. Knowing or not knowing. We start loving each other. Now we didn’t know at the time.
Q: You’re still young. She liked you?
A: Yeah. I liked her and she liked--- But it wasn’t known at the time.
Q: Right.
A: So we played around like kids.
Q: Yeah.
A: I was staying for I don’t know how many years. Three or four years by this Fishman. You have to put this together.
Q: Sure, oh sure.
A: Then I did find out and we got --sometimes we got a date with mine -- the girl, my wife.
Q: Your future wife, whose name was Hannah, right?
A: Hannah Taube. We called her Taube. In Polish they call the Tola.
Q: Tola, right.
A: So sometimes we meet downstairs without knowing that -- like kids, you know.
Q: Yeah, nothing planned.

He worked for his father. Hameecha, you know, my friend, the cousin, the uncle, he worked there too and I’m a stranger there. I didn’t learn too much. I didn’t learn too much so one day I went to Yanka Fishman and I said, Mr. Fishman, I cannot stay here. He said, why? I said because I don’t learn too much. The son and you, Hameecha there and I’m the last one.
Q: Yeah.
A: So I said I have to go look for something better. He admires this what I said. He liked it. He said okay. So I went -- at the time I knew already a little bit -- I went to another tailor by the name of Itzrek Schneider.
Q: Good name to be a tailor.
A: Huh?
Q: Good tailor name.
A: Yeah, Itzrek Schneider. He was the top tailor in town, Itzrek Schneider. Fishman, he didn’t care because he got support from his ---
Q: From his brother-in-law.

Q: Like with the others, yeah.
A: And she was not ready to give me the 10,000 zlotys. An apprentice, who is he? He is sick, he’s skinny, all kind of things they talk about me. So the money was sent to this donseka.

Why -- because I have to cut a suit, a coat and the piece I go to the Polaks right away and I have something to eat. She was happy. We went in booths for fittings.

Dress, when there’s something wrong, we know we’re going into sewing, we’re going to fix it ourselves. So we were given a barrack where we should live. We come into the barrack, I always took -- there was three beds. I always took the top.

The customers from the old shop, they took all the packages what we didn’t finish, they took it with them to the new place, to the Skolna. The customers they have to come, they were advised that to finish the garments they should come to the Skolna. Okay. We stayed in this barrack and we went into the shop.

Q: Your in-laws?
A: Yeah, sister-in-law. I went out looking for her. I didn’t see any schragen. Then I heard a voice. She starts screaming Itzrek, it’s me, Dinka. Dinka’s her name. I looked at her. I didn’t recognize her. She looked so terrible, without hair, with a thing on the head, a cover. She looked terrible. I said to her don’t worry. I’m going to try to give her a place where to stay in the barrack. I tried when we make the dresses. I tried to give her a dress. I tried to see that she should have something to eat. I cannot go home to the barracks yet. So when the day was finished, I met her. We talked and she told me what happened. The kid, she -- first of all, she told me -- my brother got typhus.
Q: Eli?
A: Yeah, in Plaszow. She managed when she went out to work, she managed to bring him a piece of bread sometimes.

A: Went down and she can only get to my brother to replace a toilet, you know. She can throw over to him some -- she organized some bread. The kid was hiding in the barrack. Not a peep. That’s what she told me. One day, they took away from the place where she worked and they transferred her to me, to my camp. She comes in.
Q: Alone, though?
A: Alone. Without the kid. She said, I don’t know what happened to the kid.
Q: Where was the kid when she left?
A: In Plaszow.
Q: But with --?
A: In the barrack.
Q: In the barrack with no one taking care of him?
A: No. They saw the kid, they killed him. What else?
Q: Eli was still sick?
A: Eli was still alive when she left. But after the war, I did find out that he starved to death in Plaszow.
Q: You don’t know when that happened?
A: No. So now I’m on the Skolna, huh?
Q: Yes, with your sister-in-law and your friends.
A: Yeah, we’re all together. Then the same thing happened. A transport arrived from Buzim. You heard of Buzim?
Q: Yes, yes.
A: When the transport arrived from Buzim, everything changed. With them came a lot of kapos. Not only Jewish kapos, other nationalities, kapos.
Q: Polish, Ukrainian?
A: Yeah. Because they liquidated Majdanek. They were sent here to our place. When the Buzim arrived, start stealing. The Buzim, they were our people but ---.
Q: Thieves?
A: I don’t know if they were thieves, they were butchers and all kind of people. Listen to this; I was sleeping one night on top of the barrack and I had a hand is crawling under mine -- like pillow. Of course, you know, if you’re hiding what you have under pillow, some money or something. On the Plaszow from the suit was hanging on the ceiling. I got sewed in there diamond. The rest was in the shop. So when I heard the hand is crawling in and I was thinking what to do. I was thinking I’m going to get up first and catch him. I got up first and I start screaming and I caught an undershirt. He was pulling away a black undershirt. I have the piece from the undershirt in my hand and he’s gone.
Q: You didn’t know who he was?
A: No. I did find out.
Q: From Buzim?
A: Yeah. I start screaming and everybody on the lower beds, everybody catch each other. He was coming out from the barrack already. We was still looking for him. I have the place from the shirt. If you go around, where there’s an empty bed, maybe he run out from the barrack or something, but no empty bed.
Q: How did you find out who he was?
A: So in the morning, I reported to -- the diamond from the Plaszow is gone, not hanging any more on top. Was on the floor. So next day I went to Friedman, _____ to Fishman, and they went to the Buzim barrack looking for somebody missing a piece of the shirt which was stupid. When we went in the barrack looking for the guy who was stealing, somebody came in and he said, that the kapos arrived, so forget about it. They’re going to liquidate us. That was not true. The kapos was still there. I didn’t know who took it. We still were there. Then one day, they’re going to liquidate the Skolna. No more Jews in Radom. So one day everybody has to go marching. We went marching. There was no trains, we marched by foot. We didn’t know where we going. We marched by day. At night they let us go in a tent (?) to lay down, to sleep. Some people, they couldn’t walk any more. If they know what happen, they would walk. A car -- not a car -- a horse and a wagon went in the back, goes with us, went with us. The SS said who cannot walk any more is tired, should go on the wagon. Near me was Mr. G_____, a little bit older than me and Mrs. Zucker. Her husband got killed on the sch______ when I told you was a fire, sabotage. They killed her husband and other people. They went on the wagon. When the wagon was full, the wagon disappeared. Then he came back, empty. Some other people, next time, they still went on the wagon. But later on, we saw something is not kosher. The second time, the wagon disappeared. The third time, nobody went on the wagon any more. Because we was sleeping on the field and then one day they said water arrived to give us, to drink water. It was so a mess that they start shooting. They shoot the people in the lakes. A lot of people. Then when they have to march again, yeah, they marched with bullets in the legs. They didn’t go on the wagon any more. But the last night, they were sleeping on the field before we went into Tomaszow- ________. It was a family -- what was the name -- Sinna I think. Was a mother, a daughter, and two sons. Sinnas.

Then I start looking for help. Moishe Goldberg cannot talk. He got a _______. He took care of the room. Was also a Radoman, Friedman. I didn’t know him too good. Later I got to be a friend of his.

After that typhus, you need to eat. Let’s say when they give you my whole Frigidaire with another grocery store, not enough. I don’t know where it goes but you can eat so much, it’s unbelievable.
Q: Where are you going to get the food?
A: I called to Laza Malamit -- message. They cannot come in here. They can send me a piece of bread or something like this. They did, they did. Then they did find somebody by the name of Firdik.

So the jar of marmalade was under the pillow. Lice, a lot, who cares. You eat the lice. I put in my hand always in the jar and licked it the marmalade. I got the onion to eat. No, I got the bread because the bread I have to hold with me. I’m laying like this, still hungry. In the same barrack, across the street, he was a Swiss or other nation, he got Red Cross packages.
Q: He’s not Jewish?
A: No, not Jewish. When I looked at him, the way he was eating the package -- chocolate and all kinds of things. Oh, I cannot go down from bed. Maybe I would steal from him, I don’t know. Then I was thinking to myself. Why he can get a package from the Red Cross and I couldn’t get it. Unless he -- you know the question.
Q: Yes. You’re asking the question now. Could you ask the question then?
A: No. To whom am I going to ask a question?
A: And you couldn’t talk to him? You couldn’t buy anything from him? You were too far away?
A: No, no. Then I said to myself. After the war, if I’m going to survive, no Red Cross for me. I’m going to hate them always and I’m not going to donate a penny to the Red Cross any more. The Jewish donating money to the Red Cross. I wouldn’t. If they can give a package to him, why not to me? Nobody would know. So I’m laying here hungry, don’t know what’s going on outside. All of a sudden, some people, Meyer Pasternak, a lot of people, they run into the barrack, to my barrack! They not allowed to go in. It’s dangerous. They’re hiding. They’re hiding in this barrack.
Q: Why?

A: They took the people from Vaihingen to Dachau. Laza Malamit went, Moishe Krol went, Meyer Pasternak, he’s in Florida. He’s a smart cookie, he didn’t go. He was hiding. Then the SS did find out. They came with guns and they shoot in the barrack. I don’t know how many people got killed or what. I was laying covered up on my place.
Q: So they shot right there in front of you? You could see it?
A: Yeah, in the barrack. In the ceiling, underneath, everywhere. Because they knew they were hiding. But still a lot of people were hiding. Next day, in the morning, just next day, people come in and they brought me white bread. White bread, all kind of things! I said what happened? The French army passed. He said, we are liberated.
