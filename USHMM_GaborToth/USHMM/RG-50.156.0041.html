Herzl, used to know Nachum Sokolow – he was his friend.</span> <span id="s58">Sokolow was his friend.</span> <span id="s59">Sokolow was at one time president of the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s60">He was a journalist.</span> <span id="s61">He was a writer for a big paper.</span> <span id="s62">He was living not far from my grandfather, and they were good friends.</span> <span id="s63">Being Orthodox Jews, still, he knows all the people – because he was a businessman – knows all the movements in Poland, the Zionist movement, and general cultural movements.</span> <span id="s64">He was involved with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Now you, of course, had an education in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s66">And Yiddish, I assume, was spoken in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: In Hebrew.</span> <span id="s68">Of course I was going to a Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s69">After, I graduated high school, and two years college.</span> <span id="s70">I was an accountant in a bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: What was the name of your college?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Business General College.</span> <span id="s73">In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And you graduated as an accountant?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And did you have a chance to practice at all?</span> <span id="s77">What year did you graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: I graduated in 1928.</span> <span id="s79">I was 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: And then I started to work – in 1929 I started to work in a bank.</span> <span id="s82">Until started the war.</span> <span id="s83">I was their main accountant in the bank – till the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Now we move to the early ‘30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: You want me to tell you about the pogroms in Russia?</span> <span id="s86">This was in 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: How did you get involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: When the 1914 war started, my grandfather went to Ukraine –a town by the name Proskurow – because his son-in-law was living there, and they were afraid in Warsaw for bombardments.</span> <span id="s89">So he went there.</span> <span id="s90">And I, being raised by my grandfather, with my mother and my brother and my sister went also there.</span> <span id="s91">This was about 1914.</span> <span id="s92">And in 1919, we were living in Proskurow, and there came the Ukrainians, with Petlura.</span> <span id="s93">Petlura was the head of the Ukrainian government.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">And this was a Sabbath afternoon.</span> <span id="s95">They went to the city and they killed out 5,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s96">This was done in three hours – from 2 till 5 o’clock.</span> <span id="s97">And I saw through the window, they were running, they weren’t coming to our house, why I don’t know.</span> <span id="s98">And after, in our house, they made a hospital for the wounded people.</span> <span id="s99">Was over 100 injured people in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you say that you watched the slaughter from the window?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: From the window I saw running, with the open swords, the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s102">Why they didn’t come into our house, is a question.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s104">Miracles!</span> <span id="s105">And in this was my grandfather, also.</span> <span id="s106">He worked with a special committee from the United States, came and saw everything.</span> <span id="s107">Also recorded for the history!</span> <span id="s108">And after, I was there till 1920.</span> <span id="s109">The governments were changing in and out there.</span> <span id="s110">The Bolsheviks came in after the Mensheviks.</span> <span id="s111">The White Russians came in after the Red Ukrainians, till the Bolsheviks.</span> <span id="s112">And then I smuggled a border – my comrades and me, together – smuggled the border back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Well now, the transition, as I recall, wasn’t it in 1917?</span> <span id="s114">Or was that the beginning of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Nineteen-seventeen started fights, there’s different groups.</span> <span id="s116">There was the Nicketses; there was the Cluroffses; there was Bolsheviks.</span> <span id="s117">The city was taken over, one by the other.</span> <span id="s118">Even the Polacks were there also in 1919.</span> <span id="s119">But after 1920, when there was already Russia, and I was from Poland, we smuggled the border to Poland, and I came back to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Very glad, I guess, to be out of there with your life!</span> <span id="s121">And you were quite young.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I was then about nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What an impression you must have had of the human race at the age of nine.</span> <span id="s124">You must have lived in fear!</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: History repeats history.</span> <span id="s126">This is Jewish history.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: So you returned to Warsaw in 1920.</span> <span id="s128">And you had your education, and you began working as an accountant.</span> <span id="s129">So now we come to the early ‘30s.</span> <span id="s130">At what point do you recall hearing the tremors?</span> <span id="s131">Getting the sense that the Nazis were beginning to build their movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: In ’33 they took over.</span> <span id="s133">Hitler took over and right away they were against Poland.</span> <span id="s134">They want back a part of Poland.</span> <span id="s135">But in Poland was also the big anti-Semitism, and was 1938, the Germans evacuated – threw out from the country – all Jews who used to be Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s136">This was in 1938, and a lot of refugees came to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Before we discuss that, may I ask you to go back a little and tell me what your experience was with anti-Semitism in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: The experience with anti-Semitism in Poland was that sometimes you go into a park, some young Poles could beat you up.</span> <span id="s139">And this was competition.</span> <span id="s140">They used to stay by stores, the Jewish stores, not to buy, because it was a Jewish store.</span> <span id="s141">And university was the fight, because they want Jewish students to be on the left side of the room – not to be mixed – and they on the right.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">And the Jewish students didn’t accept this.</span> <span id="s143">So they were staying in the middle, in the hall, because they didn’t want to sit on the left side.</span> <span id="s144">I remember once was a big demonstration of this.</span> <span id="s145">On one side was going a Jewish demonstration of students – I was with this demonstration – the other side was going the “Indecks,” this was the Polish Democratic – kind of like a Nazi Party – what was the anti-Semitic party.</span> <span id="s146">And they were walking.</span> <span id="s147">Placards.</span> <span id="s148">And the police was in the middle, protecting us from one another.</span> <span id="s149">But there was a lot of anti-Semitism, I remember.</span> <span id="s150">All the time.</span> <span id="s151">After the big pogrom, in a little town, Przytik.</span> <span id="s152">Before 1939.</span> <span id="s153">Was, I suppose, in ’37 or ’38.</span> <span id="s154">I heard only.</span> <span id="s155">I was not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: I suppose there were Jewish newspapers, and so you got all this information.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Jewish newspapers, yeah.</span> <span id="s158">Was also Polish newspapers.</span> <span id="s159">Was even one Jewish newspaper in Polish language.</span> <span id="s160">But was a lot of Jewish newspapers written in Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Now, as Nazism began to build elsewhere in Europe, you began to feel some of the tension and some of the pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Oh, sure, there was tension and pressure.</span> <span id="s163">The Jewish businessmen, starts in ’37 to boycott German products.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: The Jewish businessmen began to boycott German products.</span> <span id="s165">And your father was involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: My father was passed away.</span> <span id="s167">My grandfather was already retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: At this point you were a practicing accountant.</span> <span id="s169">Can you describe a little of the climate of those times.</span> <span id="s170">The atmosphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: The atmosphere was very harsh.</span> <span id="s172">It was a very crucial time.</span> <span id="s173">You got a lot of Jewish writers – was a Jewish writers union in Warsaw – and about every day you got a lecture on different themes.</span> <span id="s174">You got there a lot of Yeshivot, Talmudic schools.</span> <span id="s175">You got a couple Hebrew schools – not religious, but in Hebrew language – what you call it, like a regular school.</span> <span id="s176">Not a Talmudic school.</span> <span id="s177">A secular school in Hebrew language.</span> <span id="s178">And we got a lot of the secular schools.</span> <span id="s179">This was already from the Bund.</span> <span id="s180">This was a Jewish socialist organization.</span> <span id="s181">What they’ve got a lot of secular schools in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: The influence of the socialists was quite prominent at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No, I figure the Zionist movement was more prominent that the socialist movement.</span> <span id="s184">Was a lot of Jewish involved.</span> <span id="s185">Was like a rainbow!</span> <span id="s186">You got all movements.</span> <span id="s187">And everybody was fighting something, but not too much.</span> <span id="s188">In Warsaw was a Jewish Kehilla.</span> <span id="s189">This is a Jewish community what was ruling by itself.</span> <span id="s190">They got schools, and they got welfare departments and this was accepted by the government.</span> <span id="s191">As a matter of fact, they could tax all the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s192">And if somebody didn’t pay the taxes, they gave all of it to, like here the I R S, and the I R S was collecting for them the taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Now you’re talking about the Polish government doing the taxing or the Jewish government?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Both.</span> <span id="s195">Was Jewish, like here the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s196">But Jewish Federation is only if you want to give, and if you don’t want you don’t give, and they don’t have schools.</span> <span id="s197">This was like a Jewish government, they had there.</span> <span id="s198">It was elections – official elections – all the Jewish people could vote, like you’re going to a regular election.</span> <span id="s199">This was like a regular election, checked by the government, it was done correct, not cheated.</span> <span id="s200">And what I want to tell you is it was a Jewish life, a complete Jewish, a very high standard Jewish life.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: I get the picture.</span> <span id="s202">Social, cultural and economic.</span> <span id="s203">Did any of your relatives live outside the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Was not there a ghetto.</span> <span id="s205">Before 1939, you could live wherever you want.</span> <span id="s206">Was some places they didn’t let some Jews in to live.</span> <span id="s207">This is happening right here in America also.</span> <span id="s208">Was a Jewish neighborhood mostly, but people was living all over the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Did you ever serve in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Now, when the war actually broke out, before the outbreak of the war, are there any specific events that you would like to record?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Do you remember what it was like to be there at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Oh yeah, I remember.</span> <span id="s215">This was 1939, September 1st, Friday morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: How did you get the news of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: From the radio and people talking about this all over!</span> <span id="s218">And second or third day, was already bombardments.</span> <span id="s219">Seems to me that Thursday was all over the bombardments already.</span> <span id="s220">And the government was taking the people to army, drafting people to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: I suppose some Jews were drafter, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s223">They called me Sunday morning to make trenches in the heart of the city, what was very bad[ly] organized – from the bombs.</span> <span id="s224">We came there and there was not shovels, nobody knew what to do.</span> <span id="s225">Was sitting there a few hours, and after, we came home.</span> <span id="s226">And there was advertised on the radio to leave the city; to join up with the army.</span> <span id="s227">So Monday morning, this was the 4th of September, I went out with my two cousins.</span> <span id="s228">We walked out of the city going east.</span> <span id="s229">And then on the highways was already bombardments.</span> <span id="s230">And the airplanes were going down—very down – with machine guns there was shooting, and the people died.</span> <span id="s231">To the left and the right, people were killed.</span> <span id="s232">And all of us, we used to run away into the woods when we saw the panes coming.</span> <span id="s233">And we were going, this was from Warsaw, to Brest.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: What was your purpose in going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: We were going east.</span> <span id="s236">When I come to the city Brest, the Russians came from the other side.</span> <span id="s237">And I found the Russian army already.</span> <span id="s238">The Germans was bombarding the highways, and with machine guns was shooting, but their army was still far away, because they were held up a long time by Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Had you joined the draft at this point?</span> <span id="s240">Were you drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I was not drafted.</span> <span id="s242">Everybody was running.</span> <span id="s243">The government was already in a turmoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So, you were fleeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yeah, fleeing from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s246">And we went on Sunday, and this was next Friday.</span> <span id="s247">Five, six days we were walking and running on the highway.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Is this all your family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No, only I and two cousins.</span> <span id="s250">The other ones, they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s251">I got a sister, she got a little child, she couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s252">Some were going.</span> <span id="s253">Some were staying.</span> <span id="s254">And then when I came to the Russian side – let’s see, from there I went to Bialystok, and this was already the Russian side – and I was there till the end of December, and then I smuggled the border of Lithuania, because Lithuania was still a free country.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: During that time, did you have any news of other family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah, I got news.</span> <span id="s257">Some people came smuggling the border from one side to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: They smuggled news of your mother and your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yeah, they bring in a few letters.</span> <span id="s260">Even a coat for winter, somebody brought me over.</span> <span id="s261">It helped, because was September, it started to be cold, so they brought me a coat over.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: So you knew that your mother was okay at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yeah, I knew it.</span> <span id="s264">There was still not a ghetto.</span> <span id="s265">But I got news, and a few letters I got.</span> <span id="s266">When we smuggled the border of Lithuania, I was a few times caught by the Lithuanian soldiers, and they took away from me everything what I got – money and everything they took away.</span> <span id="s267">They caught me with the other few youngsters was with me, young people, they caught me, in a village.</span> <span id="s268">They took me to the police station.</span> <span id="s269">I was asleep uncovered there in the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">In the morning he said he wanted to send me back to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s271">If I would go to Russia, I right away would go to Siberia for smuggled the border.</span> <span id="s272">Anyway, was in the morning – Saturday morning – and the soldiers took me and the other two young boys to the border.</span> <span id="s273">And we were going out, was still dark, we saw a Jew going with a tallis to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s274">I went to him and we told him what is going on.</span> <span id="s275">The soldiers told him to let us leave.</span> <span id="s276">The soldiers want only money; this is all what they wanted.</span> <span id="s277">But I didn’t have already nothing.</span> <span id="s278">They told the soldiers to come with them to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s279">And when they come to the synagogue, I said: “Let me out though another door.”</span> <span id="s280">And they paid ‘em already, the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">And they took me, some, to a house, and I was there over Shabbos.</span> <span id="s282">And in the middle of the night, they took our whole group by horse and buggy to Vilna.</span> <span id="s283">This was subsidized by the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s284">The committee subsidized the money to help to save the refugees that were coming out.</span> <span id="s285">I came to Vilna.</span> <span id="s286">I was there in the Committee a few days.</span> <span id="s287">They gave some of us a house there to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Vilna was a fight before the war between Poland and Lithuania.</span> <span id="s289">Actually, Poland got, but after the Russians came in, they gave away Vilna to the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s290">So the Lithuanians didn’t want to have Jewish refugees from Poland in their capitol.</span> <span id="s291">So they sent me out to a town in Lithuania – Telz was the name of the town.</span> <span id="s292">And there I start to work a little bit in accounting.</span> <span id="s293">And after, I met my future wife there, and I got married in 1940 in December.</span> <span id="s294">And in 1941, in June, started the Russian-German war, and we start to run again.</span> <span id="s295">So then I run with my wife – always going by foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Were you able to live openly as Jews in Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s298">Lithuania I think was as anti-Semitic, but was a free country.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And you were able to practice your profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s301">I was actually not so able, because they didn’t want people not citizens of Lithuania to work – not to take away jobs or something.</span> <span id="s302">But I made a living.</span> <span id="s303">But after, when the Russians came in, I was married.</span> <span id="s304">I came to Lithuania in January.</span> <span id="s305">1940.</span> <span id="s306">But in June 1940, the Russians took over Lithuania.</span> <span id="s307">And when the Russians took over Lithuania, I could already work – officially – and I was working there as an accountant in a factory, till June 1941.</span> <span id="s308">Then I run away with my wife – with other few people.</span> <span id="s309">On the way was already Lithuanian partisans.</span> <span id="s310">They killed, from anti-Semitism, killed more Jews than Germans.</span> <span id="s311">On the highway, people came running already: “They’re killing Jews on the way.”</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Did you always wear your yarmulke?</span> <span id="s313">How could they recognize a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No, I wasn’t wearing a yarmulke.</span> <span id="s315">You can recognize a Jew.</span> <span id="s316">Sometimes you can make a mistake, but you recognize a Jew.</span> <span id="s317">It’s not so hard to recognize a Jew.</span> <span id="s318">So, all the same story on the highway, the German planes were going down, with the machine guns shooting, and then we went to a freight train and came to Kovno.</span> <span id="s319">Kovno was before, the capitol of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s320">Then I caught another train, also a freight train, and I came to Riga.</span> <span id="s321">My wife got a friend, and I was sleeping there overnight, and in the morning I want to go out, the Germans were already in the city.</span> <span id="s322">But only by a miracle, the train depot was on the Russian side, Russian sector, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">We went from this house; we came to the depot.</span> <span id="s324">There was staying a train with the families of the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s325">There were trains there.</span> <span id="s326">But there was not order – nothing.</span> <span id="s327">Nobody asked you who you are, what you are.</span> <span id="s328">We went into the train, and we went to deeper Russia, till 200 miles before Moscow.</span> <span id="s329">On the way, like I told you, the train stopped every 15-20 minutes, and the people got off from the train because the German planes were bombarding the trains where they’re going.</span> <span id="s330">But we came safely.</span> <span id="s331">This was already in July 1941.</span> <span id="s332">I was there till end of August.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Do you remember the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: It was a kolkhoz.</span> <span id="s335">This is a cooperative town – the Russian name.</span> <span id="s336">This was near Danilov.</span> <span id="s337">I was there a couple of months.</span> <span id="s338">And then I saw the front is coming nearer.</span> <span id="s339">And it started to be cold, and I have nothing to wear, and my wife didn’t have nothing, so I decided we will go southeast.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: How did you survive on the farm?</span> <span id="s341">Were you workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: We were working, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Were you accepted as Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Not as Russians!</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: They knew that you were Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s347">There was not, especially the farmers, not anti-Semitism, not any there.</span> <span id="s348">In the government was anti-Semitic, but not in the time of the war.</span> <span id="s349">In the time of the wars they were dependent[s] of United States and of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: They were allies of the U.S. and England.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Allies, yeah, Sure, you could hear something about anti-Semitic, it was single people, but not from the government.</span> <span id="s352">You didn’t feel the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s353">There was a law against religion, yeah, but not anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s354">Even then they let down the fight against religion also, because they were allies of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: So you didn’t form a synagogue on the collective farm!</span> <span id="s356">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: No.</span> <span id="s358">So the Ukrainian trains were going steady to the east, because the front was coming nearer.</span> <span id="s359">So, I went in a train.</span> <span id="s360">Nobody asked you who you are, what you are, and we went.</span> <span id="s361">And I was in Novosibirsk, and from then I went south till – different trains, not the same train always – till we came to Samarkand.</span> <span id="s362">This was in middle Asia.</span> <span id="s363">We didn’t have what to eat.</span> <span id="s364">We were without anywhere to sleep, we were sleeping on the streets because a lot of refugees were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Till finally I came to a little town, and I got a job as an accountant, because they’d mobilized a lot of the Russians.</span> <span id="s366">They were eager to get somebody to work for them.</span> <span id="s367">And I was working there afterward in another place.</span> <span id="s368">And after, I was settled in Samarkand, and I was there till 1946, in May.</span> <span id="s369">In May, I was evacuated from there to Poland because there was an agreement from United States and Russia, that all the Polish citizens, they got to let them out from Russia.</span> <span id="s370">So I came to Lodz.</span> <span id="s371">My youngest daughter was already born.</span> <span id="s372">She was born in Samarkand.</span> <span id="s373">This is not far from Afghanistan, a couple hundred miles, not more, maybe less, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s374">And then I came to Lodz.</span> <span id="s375">And it was our idea to leave for Germany – there was the Jewish camps – and from there to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: But of course, when you returned to Poland, you heard all the stories of the atrocities, and most of your family members….</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Oh, year.</span> <span id="s378">I didn’t find nobody!</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Being in Lodz, I heard everybody is gone!</span> <span id="s381">The Holocaust!</span> <span id="s382">I heard before, but now I see.</span> <span id="s383">I looked for a relative, friends.</span> <span id="s384">I couldn’t find nobody!</span> <span id="s385">Lodz is like a little park, people know my family.</span> <span id="s386">My sister and brother-in-law were taken to the concentration [camp].</span> <span id="s387">She got a little baby, and the baby was killed.</span> <span id="s388">And after 1945 they were driven on the highways, in Germany.</span> <span id="s389">They passed away on the highway in Germany.</span> <span id="s390">Somebody told me this.</span> <span id="s391">And my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s392">My grandmother, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s393">I decided to go out to Warsaw to visit the grave of my father, because I know I’m going to leave already Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">And my wife, I left her in Lodz, because it was very dangerous then to ride the trains, because the Poles saw a Jew, they threw ‘em out the window.</span> <span id="s395">It was right away after the pogrom in Kielce, done already by the Poles.</span> <span id="s396">But anyway, I went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s397">In Warsaw I didn’t find Jews at all.</span> <span id="s398">From there I went to Prague, this is the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s399">Next day I went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s400">I tried to come to my apartment, where I was living.</span> <span id="s401">All the houses were all down!</span> <span id="s402">But just my apartment was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s403">Amazing.</span> <span id="s404">I went in there.</span> <span id="s405">There a man was living.</span> <span id="s406">I asked if I can see the rooms.</span> <span id="s407">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s408">And after that I went out, the gentile told me that “You’ve got a lot of books in basement.”</span> <span id="s409">But I was afraid to go down there with the gentile, because this was after the pogrom.</span> <span id="s410">I didn’t trust the Poles, especially to go down in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">So, I went from there to the cemetery, to my father’s grave.</span> <span id="s412">I couldn’t reach, because it was weeds and trees growing during the war.</span> <span id="s413">In the beginning, right in the beginning of the cemetery, there was a monument of my grandmother’s great-grandfather.</span> <span id="s414">He was the first rabbi in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s415">And I come in there and I take a look to the left side, a little stone is there, and I read the cover, and this is the grave of my grandfather by whom I was raised.</span> <span id="s416">And I didn’t have a camera with me to write this down.</span> <span id="s417">So I took the cast.</span> <span id="s418">This is the copy of this.</span> <span id="s419">I want to show you.</span> <span id="s420">This is a copy of my grandfather’s stone.</span> <span id="s421">I wrote this down.</span> <span id="s422">I recorded by hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: What does it say?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: What this says is: “Here is buried Rabbi Moshe Alexander, the son of a Rabbi Yonke Vesukeh Engelman” – this was the stories that I want to tell you, they’re written – “…a grandson of a rabbi, of a big scholar from the city of Koll.</span> <span id="s425">He gave out a book, the name of Bet Aaron – The House of Aaron.”</span> <span id="s426">This is all what is written in this.</span> <span id="s427">There the book is, the second on my grandfather’s father’s.</span> <span id="s428">They’re written, all the stories, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: This is a book that was published recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: This was published in ’46, in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And these books tell the story of your family members.</span> <span id="s432">So that’s something to be very proud of.</span> <span id="s433">It may be that people from the ADL would like this material, but I won’t ask you for it now.</span> <span id="s434">I’m sure that’s very valuable to you!</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: To me it’s a matter of life and death.</span> <span id="s436">From the cemetery I found when my grandfather passed away.</span> <span id="s437">He passed away a few months before the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s438">Who put up the stone, the monument, I don’t know who it is, but I found it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: What stories did you hear of the resistance within the ghetto?</span> <span id="s440">Did you meet people who had taken part in it?</span> <span id="s441">And who had survived it?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: I met people what resisted in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s443">I met not a lot of people from concentration camps, but I met a person what he was from the fights in the resistance, and in the concentration camp they ran out.</span> <span id="s444">They caught some, and two or three were left alive.</span> <span id="s445">After coming back to Lodz, we went to the Czechoslovakian border.</span> <span id="s446">And there we smuggled, and with my little daughter in hand.</span> <span id="s447">This was in 1946.</span> <span id="s448">She was a year old.</span> <span id="s449">From Czechoslovakia we went to Austria.</span> <span id="s450">Was always illegal, but was already organized by the Bricha.</span> <span id="s451">You know what Bricha is?</span> <span id="s452">This was an Israel organization where they managed to take out the Jews from Poland to take ‘em to Germany, and from Germany to Israel.</span> <span id="s453">I went with them from Czechoslovakia to Austria.</span> <span id="s454">From Austria we came to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: What was that like – to go through Germany at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Was not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s457">I got a room from the Committee in a house where her husband was a general in the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did you not experience hostility at that point?</span> <span id="s459">A great deal of hostility?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: There were afraid.</span> <span id="s461">Right after the war, the Germans were afraid.</span> <span id="s462">But I saw a lot of this.</span> <span id="s463">The woman asked me if I can’t help make a Sunday, to clean up the stones by the house there, because all the neighborhood made a project.</span> <span id="s464">So, I took a look on that, and told her, I was working enough for the Germans, not to work again.</span> <span id="s465">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: How did you deal with your own anger at this point – living in Germans – and among Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: We got used to this.</span> <span id="s468">Everything.</span> <span id="s469">Like think now about the running, and suffering, and not having what to eat, and the airplanes from up, shooting – it was terrible!</span> <span id="s470">But when you’re living this hour, you’re not thinking even about this.</span> <span id="s471">The body’s going so immune to these dangers.</span> <span id="s472">You’re not afraid more.</span> <span id="s473">You get used to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: And I suppose you begin to think a lot about your own survival and what it means?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh, year, sure.</span> <span id="s476">Everybody what survived, it was a miracle!</span> <span id="s477">Because they saw death hundreds of times and you see lots of it yourself, death before your eyes.</span> <span id="s478">But I happened to survive.</span> <span id="s479">It was a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did this strengthen your relationship with your God?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s482">When I went out before, I was religious.</span> <span id="s483">The last few years in Poland, I was religious again, but I was already more worldly.</span> <span id="s484">I start to be a member of the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s485">And, after coming to Russia, I was not able to observe at all the religion.</span> <span id="s486">I remember, when I ran away from Poland, this was in 1939, I never eat not-kosher food.</span> <span id="s487">And this was Erev Yom Kippur, the day before Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s488">We were running and didn’t eat nothing.</span> <span id="s489">Came sudden a little village, and a Polish farmer gave us soup to eat.</span> <span id="s490">That this was the first time when I was eating not-kosher food with little pieces of meat inside, but I was not eating in a couple days!</span></p> <p><span id="s491">And then, during the war you couldn’t have it.</span> <span id="s492">You started being not so religious.</span> <span id="s493">You was not looking for religion.</span> <span id="s494">I still observed, even in Russia, observed the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s495">Passover I didn’t eat bread.</span> <span id="s496">But the rest is sacrilege.</span> <span id="s497">After I came here to the United States, in the beginning, I wasn’t so religious at all.</span> <span id="s498">Just the last years is turning back to religion.</span> <span id="s499">Not that I seem so ready, about 15, 20 or 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: It takes time to be Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s502">I was working here on Sabbath!</span> <span id="s503">But after, when I went in my new business, it was possible not to work the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s504">I stopped and worked non-Sabbath.</span> <span id="s505">And now my business is up and closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Was it the same organization that helped you go to Israel that had helped you before?</span> <span id="s507">You mentioned the Bricha.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: The Bricha?</span> <span id="s509">Yeah.</span> <span id="s510">They helped me from Czechoslovakia to Germany.</span> <span id="s511">And from Germany, I want to go to Israel, but Israel was still not a government, not independent.</span> <span id="s512">Was 1946.</span> <span id="s513">And I had a little girl.</span> <span id="s514">I couldn’t go illegal.</span> <span id="s515">So my wife got here in Minneapolis two brothers and two sisters from before.</span> <span id="s516">So we decided to go to United States.</span> <span id="s517">In 1948, we came to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Which organization helped you make that change?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: HIAS.</span> <span id="s520">Actually, the relatives paid for everything.</span> <span id="s521">But they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: At this point, what would you say that it means to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: (Sigh) What it means to be a survivor of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s524">Sometimes we’re very well off.</span> <span id="s525">You raise children.</span> <span id="s526">No uncles, no aunties, no grandfathers, no grandmothers, and you do, everything by yourself!</span> <span id="s527">And you start a new life!</span> <span id="s528">And I suppose they got some on your psychology, you got something, a kind of print on this!</span> <span id="s529">The brain is a computer.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: An imprint of what you lived through, that you never really erase.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Imprint, yeah.</span> <span id="s532">And you can never forget this.</span> <span id="s533">But life is life.</span> <span id="s534">Is going on.</span> <span id="s535">And this is life.</span> <span id="s536">You can lose in death, dear ones, friend ones, but life is life!</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: But always this feeling of being cut off from your roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: From the family – the roots, yeah.</span> <span id="s539">But I go a lot of times to Israel, because there I got some cousins – near cousins, far cousins – I’ve got some family left, over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Has your belief in a Supreme Being changed over these many generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I told you.</span> <span id="s542">Logically you think, “Why!</span> <span id="s543">Why” Why!”</span> <span id="s544">You cannot answer.</span> <span id="s545">You believe, and this is your tradition.</span> <span id="s546">This is all.</span> <span id="s547">Because this is happening, should I start to be not religious?</span> <span id="s548">I can’t tell.</span> <span id="s549">I started to be not religious, because the circumstances were.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Right, but you didn’t turn away from God!</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I didn’t turn away from God, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: You didn’t feel that God had failed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Some do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Well, some did it, yes.</span> <span id="s556">You got in the Jewish religion, you got rabbis asking, “Why?</span> <span id="s557">Why they suffered?”</span> <span id="s558">In all the persecutions that was during the last 2,000 years.</span> <span id="s559">Everybody asked the question, “Why?”</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Do you have an answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No answer to this!</span> <span id="s562">You cannot tell.</span> <span id="s563">You can’t tell this.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Do you find that you’re cynical about humanity?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah, I’ll tell you, but it’s not only the Germans.</span> <span id="s566">Even the Americans in this time, even Roosevelt!</span> <span id="s567">They called it up, reconnaissance photographs, and they didn’t want to give out what they asked him to bombard there the trains what I going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s568">They didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s569">They didn’t let it be known.</span> <span id="s570">Now, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Viet Nam, from all over.</span> <span id="s571">Then, nobody’s let in to the United States!</span> <span id="s572">Jews – the ships were going back to Germany.</span> <span id="s573">They didn’t let in.</span> <span id="s574">The same thing, England.</span> <span id="s575">Didn’t let in nobody to Israel.</span> <span id="s576">So you got a cruel world.</span> <span id="s577">Sure, the Germans were terrible.</span> <span id="s578">But I figure, all the world was against the Jews!</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Do you think our Jewish tradition makes us different?</span> <span id="s580">Do you think that there’s a sensitivity and an ethical value that we’re brought up with that makes us different from other cultures?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: From other cultures?</span> <span id="s582">The ethical values is got a lot to do with this, because you calling this the “Am a sepher” – the nation of the Book.</span> <span id="s583">Because really, Jews were studying, always studying.</span> <span id="s584">And they got a lot of ethical and moral teachings.</span> <span id="s585">And this went in their blood – the teaching, the moral teachings – like anti-Semitism went in the blood of the gentiles.</span> <span id="s586">In the churches, they were always telling them, through the centuries, “Jews are the God-killer, the Jews are poisoning our lives and our water and everything.”</span> <span id="s587">And this went into their blood!</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Were you brought up to believe that all life, whether Jewish or gentile, is sacred?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Oh, no question!</span> <span id="s590">No question!</span> <span id="s591">Every life is sacred.</span> <span id="s592">According to Jewish religion, the whole life is sacred.</span> <span id="s593">You got some things that make a difference, between Jewish life and a gentile guy, but he got to agree to this.</span> <span id="s594">But not in our days.</span> <span id="s595">Then was tied to circumstances.</span> <span id="s596">For instance, if I would be in a concentration camp, I would make also difference between Jewish life and German life.</span> <span id="s597">I will not hesitate to kill a German.</span> <span id="s598">Culture is changing.</span> <span id="s599">Conditions are changing, and you can never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Survival becomes the primary value in that.</span> <span id="s601">When you came here as a refugee, did you feel a tremendous sense of separation from other people – non-survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: You feel there a difference between other people.</span> <span id="s603">Even today, seems to me, people thinks still I am a refugee.</span> <span id="s604">I heard some people talking, my friends, relatives, they want to say, “Take a look” – my son – “His kid makes a living.</span> <span id="s605">Take a look how the refugees…” They forgot to say I’m a refugee, also.</span> <span id="s606">(Laughs) “Take a look how the refugee’s doing well now.”</span> <span id="s607">But, I don’t know, this is life.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: What about the idea of “survivor guilt” that many people have written about?</span> <span id="s609">Have you ever experienced that?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: I figure, very wrong!</span> <span id="s611">Because you got a Jewish saying: “Don’t judge a person till you’ll be in his place.”</span> <span id="s612">If a German faces you with a gun, you angry!</span> <span id="s613">What can you do!</span> <span id="s614">You can’t fight with him!</span> <span id="s615">I will tell you another story.</span> <span id="s616">I remember I was one time in the Center here.</span> <span id="s617">There was an Israeli; was talking about the same problem.</span> <span id="s618">And he was saying that Jews were going like sheep to the slaughter.</span> <span id="s619">And he even mentioned this, this got to do with the Jewish religion, because the Jewish religion didn’t allow you to fight!</span></p> <p><span id="s620">And I answered him [with] one question: Babi Yar was in 1941.</span> <span id="s621">That was after the revolution.</span> <span id="s622">How many years after the revolution?</span> <span id="s623">The revolution was in 1917.</span> <span id="s624">This was about from ’17 till ’41, 24 years.</span> <span id="s625">And there was all the Jews there, were not religious.</span> <span id="s626">So they’re together with the Russian people – assimilated – and while thousands and thousands of Jews were killed in Babi Yar, and nobody started a fight against.</span> <span id="s627">This had nothing to do with religion, nothing to do because you’re afraid.</span> <span id="s628">This has to do with they got guns and machine guns, and a lot of army.</span> <span id="s629">You stand naked!</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: And what do you teach your children about power?</span> <span id="s631">About this act of survival?</span> <span id="s632">As a Jew and as a survivor.</span> <span id="s633">How did this affect your training of your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I always tried to teach ‘em Jewish values.</span> <span id="s635">Very high.</span> <span id="s636">They’re always going to Talmud Torah.</span> <span id="s637">And my boys are going a couple of years to yeshiva, and one was going to Yeshiva University.</span> <span id="s638">But I told ‘em the same thing.</span> <span id="s639">You gotta fight for your rights!</span> <span id="s640">No question!</span> <span id="s641">But it depends on the circumstances.</span> <span id="s642">If you are sitting in a prison, you can do nothing.</span> <span id="s643">And I tried to give ‘em all the Jewish values.</span> <span id="s644">This is all.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: What about the treatment of the Holocaust in books and in films – in terms of what you experienced.</span> <span id="s646">Do you feel that it’s valid?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: (Sigh) I would say it’s very valid.</span> <span id="s648">And it’s got to be written more in English – for people to know – all the world to know!</span> <span id="s649">I was last week in St. Paul, the Holocaust Remembrance in Temple of Aaron.</span> <span id="s650">But I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s651">Made like a theatre, a play of this.</span> <span id="s652">The singing was not correct; I not like to make it into a theatre, because it was a tragedy!</span> <span id="s653">They made it a kind of a play.</span> <span id="s654">I think it should be a lecture, or talking about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: There was a tendency then to “romanticize” the events?</span> <span id="s656">To romanticize?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: A little, but not too much.</span> <span id="s658">I didn’t like the talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Somehow you feel that the truth is lost as we become very theatrical.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s661">Was with the theatricals the truth was just lost.</span> <span id="s662">And was even there a cantor was singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: And you don’t see it as a show?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Was like a show.</span> <span id="s665">Was singing something.</span> <span id="s666">I don’t know what they were singing with the melody from “Bei Mir Bist du Schoen.”</span> <span id="s667">I didn’t like

camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s674">This is part of the true life what happened!</span> <span id="s675">The same thing: What could she do?</span> <span id="s676">She could resist?</span> <span id="s677">She couldn’t resist!</span> <span id="s678">And this is true!</span> <span id="s679">This is true life!</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: To what extent have you shared your memories of all of this with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Oh, I’ve told ‘em all the stories – what happened.</span> <span id="s682">And if was a film about the Holocaust, I always tried to take ‘em to see it.</span> <span id="s683">And there was memorial days on the Holocaust, was some gatherings, I took ‘em always.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Are your children interested in these memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Of course they’re interested.</span> <span id="s686">They were raised completely Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Do you think of America as a land of promise?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: I don’t believe in America to happen this, what is happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s689">But it surprises.</span> <span id="s690">You got all the surprises in history.</span> <span id="s691">Who would believe that this will happen in Germany?</span> <span id="s692">So cultural a nation.</span> <span id="s693">But America’s a little bit different, because you’ve got different nations.</span> <span id="s694">It’s built not from one nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Different nations within the nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: See now, what happened, with Jackson.</span> <span id="s697">Farrakhan and his racism.</span> <span id="s698">He’s got many followers.</span> <span id="s699">And this is the Black community!</span> <span id="s700">Where they all got persecuted.</span> <span id="s701">So you cannot be surprised.</span> <span id="s702">You’ve got surprises in history.</span> <span id="s703">Can never know.</span> <span id="s704">For instance, if I would go to Israel, it’s not because you want to run away from the United States!</span> <span id="s705">You want to go because you know there you will be able to have a full Jewish life!</span> <span id="s706">But not to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Well, I gather America has been good to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s709">I have not to complain about America.</span> <span id="s710">I complain of this or that – during the war in America!</span> <span id="s711">But not now.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: And now you participate fully in the Jewish community here?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Oh, yah.</span> <span id="s714">Synagogues, Federation, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s716">Well I thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
