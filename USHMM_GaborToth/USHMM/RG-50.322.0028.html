1981</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: Today is Oct. 9, 1981.</span> <span id="s3">I am Barbara Turoff, a member of the Survivor of the Holocaust oral History project.</span> <span id="s4">This afternoon I have the privilege of interviewing Hannah Northway at her home in Yellow Springs, Ohio (located about 20 miles west of Dayton).</span> <span id="s5">Where she resides with her husband and family.</span> <span id="s6">I cannot describe the setting.</span> <span id="s7">It is fortunately very beautiful, in contrast to the subject we are going to discuss.</span> <span id="s8">We are sitting outdoors, surrounded by goats, chickens, dogs, cats and a lovely natural landscape.</span> <span id="s9">With that as a preliminary I am going to begin by allowing Hannah to introduce herself.</span> <span id="s10">Maybe we could start with that process and, from that point, go back to a not too pleasant subject.</span> <span id="s11">With regard to the present I know that you are a mother, a wife and that you have professional activities.</span> <span id="s12">You are a teacher.</span> <span id="s13">I turn this over to you.</span> <span id="s14">Perhaps you can introduce yourself and tell us how long you have lived in Yellow Springs.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I am a mother and a wife and a teacher.</span> <span id="s16">I have been all three for 35 years -- not a mother, I have been a mother for only 31.</span> <span id="s17">I don’t know which is the most important part of my life.</span> <span id="s18">My children; I feel that being a mother is an important part of my life.</span> <span id="s19">However all of them are important.</span> <span id="s20">As long as I have had five children I have always been a substitute teacher, I have my fingers somewhat in the pie, but I have been a substitute at least one day a week.</span> <span id="s21">I have been a mother and a teacher for as long as I can remember.</span> <span id="s22">My husband and I met in NYC.</span> <span id="s23">He was a conscientious objector.</span> <span id="s24">He was in a malaria unit.</span> <span id="s25">He loved folk dancing.</span> <span id="s26">We got married rather quickly, six months after we got to know each other.</span> <span id="s27">I was 19 and he was 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: 1946.</span> <span id="s30">We lived in New York for three more years.</span> <span id="s31">I was a junior in college.</span> <span id="s32">I had to finish school which is always a good life insurance.</span> <span id="s33">You have something to fall back on if something happens.</span> <span id="s34">Then I taught for one year in NYC in an after-school program.</span> <span id="s35">They hired teachers in a tuition program.</span> <span id="s36">Then we moved to Yellow Springs.</span> <span id="s37">We wanted to move into a small community that was interracial and interfaith.</span> <span id="s38">We were not interested in raising our children as Jews as such; but we were interested in having them know that they came from a Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s39">I did not want them coming home with anti-Semitic jokes.</span> <span id="s40">They had a Jewish heritage.</span> <span id="s41">Both of us felt really strongly about that.</span> <span id="s42">We thought of Hawalace, Oregon (transcriber cannot locate this place or anything which sounds like this) in the area of Eugene.</span> <span id="s43">.</span> <span id="s44">We also knew of Yellow Springs with Antioch and that culture in the town, which had all the qualifications.</span> <span id="s45">We decided on Yellow Springs because it was close to my parents who lived in NYC and Dick’s folks who lived in Indiana.</span> <span id="s46">Richard was raised in a small town, on a farm of 20 acres, one of six children.</span> <span id="s47">His parents were not so well educated.</span> <span id="s48">His mother did not finish high school, she actually never finished elementary school.</span> <span id="s49">His father went to high school and graduated; then he had one year of college.</span> <span id="s50">Our backgrounds were quite different.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Your husband is not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: My husband comes from a Methodist background.</span> <span id="s53">At the time we were engaged and Dick was going home and see his parents and tell them that we were going to get married.</span> <span id="s54">He said that he came home and he talked to his parents and he told his Mom that I am Jewish; she said: “I don’t care what she is, as long as she is a good Christian girl!”</span> <span id="s55">Christian meant to my mother-in-law a good, ethical person.</span> <span id="s56">That is “Christian” with a small “c”.</span> <span id="s57">I am sure that they had not heard of Judaism, as such, since there was no one in town like that.</span> <span id="s58">Well, they had, but they had not come in contact with any one who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s59">They were both extremely nice in accepting me and I could not have asked for better parents-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: How long have you lived in Yellow Springs?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I became pregnant with our first child in ’49, so we decided that it was time to move.</span> <span id="s62">Actually it was the other way around; we decided to move so we decided to have a child.</span> <span id="s63">We decided move to Yellow Springs, so we came in 1949.</span> <span id="s64">We lived out at Glenn Homestead!</span> <span id="s65">We bought a little house and fixed it up.</span> <span id="s66">My husband did not have a job.</span> <span id="s67">He came here and did odd jobs.</span> <span id="s68">At one time he was painting Lucille Morgan’s barn behind the Community Theater.</span> <span id="s69">Lucille Morgan heard that I was pregnant and that Dick was looking for a job, so she went to Ernest Morgan and said: “Ernest, we must hire Richard Northway!</span> <span id="s70">He is a good worker.”</span> <span id="s71">That is how he got a job at the Book Plate Company, and he has been there ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: From the description of your life, you seem to have such a positive outlook.</span> <span id="s73">It is interesting that you are integrated in life and that you accept being married to a non-Jewish person.</span> <span id="s74">Let us now go back a little and see how you came to where you are now.</span> <span id="s75">OK, let’s go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I forgot to mention that we do have six children.</span> <span id="s77">OK, you were going to ask me about that later!</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s79">That’s fine!</span> <span id="s80">It is good that you bring that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: We do have six children.</span> <span id="s82">Our eldest is now settled in Eugene, Ore.</span> <span id="s83">As a psychologist with Rabbi Gettlich and as a carpenter as a combination.</span> <span id="s84">Our second child, Tom, is happily married in Denmark to a Danish woman.</span> <span id="s85">They now have a child.</span> <span id="s86">He is a teacher and she is working on an associate degree.</span> <span id="s87">Jean is very happy in Yellow Springs working as a nursery school teacher and part time bar tender.</span> <span id="s88">Betty is in Seattle, wash.</span> <span id="s89">She is happily married to a lovely young man, Alan.</span> <span id="s90">They are making their life together after graduating from college.</span> <span id="s91">Paula is still a senior in high school and she is interested in possibly becoming a veterinarian or something in that line.</span> <span id="s92">Then we adopted, 10 years ago, a young black boy, who was three years old, at the time.</span> <span id="s93">He is now turning out to be a beautiful 13-year old upcoming teenager.</span> <span id="s94">He still goes down to the Art School and is very musical.</span> <span id="s95">He is very thoughtful and likes playing the violin and piano and cornet.</span> <span id="s96">He is just beginning to find out who he really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Again, as you elaborate your life seems so competent and you seem to have such a, I would say, a good point of view on life in terms of family and by the fact that you adopted a black child, not a Jewish child, that you married a non-Jewish rather than a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s98">I will go back again and if anything I ask is objectionable or too personal, don’t hesitate to tell me.</span> <span id="s99">Let’s go back to your life!</span> <span id="s100">You were telling me that you were born in Germany.</span> <span id="s101">Let’s start with what year you were born in.</span> <span id="s102">Let us just go back and see if, maybe, the fact that Germany was an integrated society, if that had any bearing on your life.</span> <span id="s103">Maybe we could start with when you were born and with how old you were when Hitler came to power!</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I was born in 1926, in Sept.</span> <span id="s105">As I think back I cannot remember very much of my early childhood.</span> <span id="s106">I am an only child.</span> <span id="s107">All my life I regretted that.</span> <span id="s108">I imagined playmates on and off.</span> <span id="s109">The thing which stands out in my mind is that after my paternal grandparents died, in 1933, my father never seemed to be equally happy, as he had been earlier.</span> <span id="s110">He never seemed to smile as much.</span> <span id="s111">Maybe that had something to do with the sudden death of his parents and with the rise of Hitler.</span> <span id="s112">I guess Hitler had been in power about six months, or rather nine months.</span> <span id="s113">I do not remember much of the actual taking of power.</span> <span id="s114">The impression on a five year old, at the time (BP corrects HN to make it seven and HN agrees, although she was just a little over six.</span> <span id="s115">HN was seven years old when her grandparents committed suicide) was that, all of a sudden I saw a lot of brown shirts (the S.A. or “Sturm Abteilung” i.e. the Storm Troopers of Hitler’s party were brown shirts and trousers, as uniforms) and a lot of marching and goose-stepping.</span> <span id="s116">That was very impressive for all the children who went to school with me.</span> <span id="s117">I just went to the first grade in public school.</span> <span id="s118">All the girls around me were wearing brown dresses and the boys were wearing their uniforms such as white shirts and black pants.</span> <span id="s119">I can’t visualize it, but I can see the little girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Do you recall your friends of that time?</span> <span id="s121">Was there any difference in playmates at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, I can’t remember very much.</span> <span id="s123">Maybe I blocked it out.</span> <span id="s124">I still can’t remember much.</span> <span id="s125">My more vivid memories were of going to a Jewish school where there were only Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: After 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I guess so, after the first grade.</span> <span id="s128">This is very unclear to me when I started to go there.</span> <span id="s129">I guess that it was seen after Jan. 1933, when Jewish children were not allowed into public schools anymore.</span> <span id="s130">I can’t remember an awful lot about that, except that we used to tease the teachers an awful lot and that we had to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s131">That school is kind of a blank for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s133">Let’s go back to the time before Hitler took power.</span> <span id="s134">Do you remember who your close friends were?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s136">They were the same people who were my close friends afterwards.</span> <span id="s137">They probably happened to all have been Jewish (in public school HN was the only Jewish girl in her class, says her mother, Margaret Ebert, who was interviewed as part of this project) however they did leave Germany eventually, before we did.</span> <span id="s138">When you are five years old, you don’t have any real playmates.</span> <span id="s139">Do you look back and have any close friends at age five or seven?</span> <span id="s140">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: You don’t remember any dramatic break?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No.</span> <span id="s143">I don’t remember anything dramatic.</span> <span id="s144">I remember not being able to go swimming or skating (all these recreational areas and even entire towns were posted, from 1934 on: “Jews not wanted here!”)</span> <span id="s145">I remember being in the Jewish school and that other children kept teasing us as “Jews” and hitting us on our way to and from school.</span> <span id="s146">(If you hit back you were, even as a young child, liable to be punished by the authorities on the spot!)</span> <span id="s147">You know, that type of thing.</span> <span id="s148">I don’t exactly know what happened, in relation to how old I was, but, you know, I remember some of these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Now, at an earlier age, you probably had been allowed to go swimming and to do some of these other things.</span> <span id="s150">You don’t recall any conflict, in your mind, as to why you could do that at an earlier point but not at a later point.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: My parents must have done a really good job.</span> <span id="s152">I remember going to Switzerland on vacation and about how nice it was to be able to do all these things, which I could not do at home, as a youngster.</span> <span id="s153">I don’t remember much!</span> <span id="s154">I can relate very well to Blacks living here and people calling them “Nigger!”</span> <span id="s155">You know that you make a person stronger if you can give him a lot of love and attention.</span> <span id="s156">I can relate to the fact of being called names.</span> <span id="s157">You have to carry your head twice as high!</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: What do you recall id someone were to ask you: “What is your whole life like?”</span> <span id="s159">“What did your parents do?”</span> <span id="s160">“What style of living did you have?”</span> <span id="s161">Do you remember your parents putting emphasis on religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I don’t remember the nurse we had.</span> <span id="s163">I remember us always having a maid, at one time or another.</span> <span id="s164">Toward the end of our time in Germany, Jews were not allowed to have maids.</span> <span id="s165">I do remember going to the Temple.</span> <span id="s166">My father and mother were not very religious.</span> <span id="s167">My grandparents, on my mother’s side, went to Temple every Friday night.</span> <span id="s168">At my grandparents’ house they would have the Kiddush (the prayer over the candles, the wine and the bread which is said in a Jewish home, traditionally, on the eve of the Shabbat, or any other Holy Day) and then sitting down for the meal.</span> <span id="s169">I just remember going to my grandparents Friday nights!</span> <span id="s170">I remember Chanukah (the eight day period of the rededication of the Temple sanctuary after the Maccabees chased the Syrians from Jerusalem -- at that time, traditionally, candles are lit, prayers and songs are chanted every night).</span> <span id="s171">I had a period when I was quite Zionistic (this means that she wanted to go to Zion, i.e. to Palestine).</span> <span id="s172">I wanted to move to Palestine.</span> <span id="s173">My parents were not Zionist.</span> <span id="s174">I had a period, probably just before coming to the U.S., i.e. between 37 and 40 I would say, where I was almost kosher.</span> <span id="s175">You know, I tried it, I celebrated all the Jewish Holy Days and I am sure that I did not agree with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Let us backtrack chronologically.</span> <span id="s177">In 1933 Hitler took power.</span> <span id="s178">When did you leave Germany?</span> <span id="s179">I remember in my conversation with your mother that you left earlier than she did, in 1938, and that you went to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s181">After Nov. 10, 1938, which was called Kristallnacht, because of all the broken glass, (that was the night when the Nazis, i.e. the followers of Hitler, had a government sponsored pogrom in Germany, when all the synagogues and all the stores owned by Jews, as well as many apartments in which Jews lived were located and burned to the ground and Jewish men were arrested on sight), my mother took me to Switzerland, to Basel.</span> <span id="s182">I stayed there for about three weeks.</span> <span id="s183">I remember being extremely homesick, so homesick that I cried every night and the woman with whom I stayed was not very sympathetic to my tears.</span> <span id="s184">Finally, after three weeks, I came home.</span> <span id="s185">They allowed me back into Germany!</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: What was life like back then?</span> <span id="s187">That was a pretty bad time already in Germany.</span> <span id="s188">Were you still living in the same house?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes, we still stayed in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Do you remember what it was like, eating wise?</span> <span id="s191">Do you remember concern about what you could get?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No, not yet!</span> <span id="s193">That happened after the war started on Sept.1, 1939.</span> <span id="s194">This was still 1938!</span> <span id="s195">Things were pretty much the same.</span> <span id="s196">I mean that I went to school.</span> <span id="s197">My parents had a big yard which was away from the house.</span> <span id="s198">They had a piece of property on which nothing had been built.</span> <span id="s199">It seemed to be an area, actually it was probably less than an acre, where I could play with my friends from the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s200">It was a fenced in area and we would play.</span> <span id="s201">We pretended that we were in Palestine, on a Kibbutz (these were the types of communal village where immigrants settled) and go out and plant our garden and come home.</span> <span id="s202">It was nice.</span> <span id="s203">It was isolated from the rest of the community.</span> <span id="s204">It was a pretty safe upbringing.</span> <span id="s205">You know, as long as we were in a fenced in yard, no one would bother us.</span> <span id="s206">It was large!</span> <span id="s207">We were impressed by the fact that if you went out in the street you would be taunted, however you accepted that, as I am sure that a black person playing on Main Street does.</span> <span id="s208">It is a part of life!</span> <span id="s209">Then, in 1939, things were getting hard.</span> <span id="s210">My father left for England (he was tipped off that he was going to be arrested).</span> <span id="s211">That was a lot of trouble, but I stayed with my mother.</span> <span id="s212">We moved to Mannheim after the war started, in Sept. ’39.</span> <span id="s213">My memories of those days were that my mother would come back from her work at the Gestapo (Geheime Staats Polizei or Secret State Police).</span> <span id="s214">When she would go to visit the Gestapo, she would get back when she could.</span> <span id="s215">I remember that I was carrying a goodly amount of money with me in a purse around my neck to be used in case we were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What do you think that you would do with the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Oh, I would try to leave, try to get to England or Scotland (HN’s father had taken refuge in one country and his brother in the other).</span> <span id="s218">I never thought about that.</span> <span id="s219">I guess that if you have enough security you don’t need to worry about it.</span> <span id="s220">It wasn’t that much of a thought.</span> <span id="s221">As I said that some days my mom would get home from work late, but I didn’t feel extremely threatened, at least not now, as I look back on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Do you recall discussing what was going on with your friends or with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes, I could not understand why my parents had waited so long and why it took us so long to get to the U.S., or otherwise to get out.</span> <span id="s224">Hitler was not getting easier.</span> <span id="s225">Many of my classmates had left for Holland or for the U.S. I realize now that my mother did not leave because of her parents.</span> <span id="s226">She felt very strongly that she had to take care of her parents and they were not going to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: You do not recall a gradual or dramatic deterioration of your lifestyle?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, I guess that I do; but there was still food on the table, at least until after the war started and there was rationing.</span> <span id="s229">Then we were getting a cup of milk a day and things of that type.</span> <span id="s230">Now, that affected my mother more than it did me.</span> <span id="s231">You know that you accept things like that as long as you have the security.</span> <span id="s232">I mean children will live through poverty and lots of things, as long as there is enough security there.</span> <span id="s233">They will grow up as normal persons.</span> <span id="s234">I really credit my parents with doing a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: I am impressed and totally amazed.</span> <span id="s236">I am also curious about your interest in Zionism.</span> <span id="s237">Where did you get your ideas on that?</span> <span id="s238">From the school?</span> <span id="s239">From your teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Well, the school was part of it.</span> <span id="s241">We had to learn Hebrew and some English.</span> <span id="s242">I could not speak any English, but I certainly knew some basics by the time I came here.</span> <span id="s243">We had a Zionist Youth Movement, you know, of the type of the Boy and Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s244">In our groups there were Zionists also, and, as I said, we fantasized.</span> <span id="s245">We made Hebrew signs when we were in the yard, we talked about what people did on the Kibbutz.</span> <span id="s246">There was a little hill and I can still see us marching up with a shovel on the shoulder as if we were going out into the fields.</span> <span id="s247">You know, we played like any nine or ten year old.</span> <span id="s248">Now they fantasize about going into space.</span> <span id="s249">So we went to our Kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Was there discussion in school concerning what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: There must have been.</span> <span id="s252">I can’t remember!</span> <span id="s253">We didn’t do it much (there was the constant fear of being overheard and denounced).</span> <span id="s254">I always regret, since German is my mother tongue, I have forgotten much.</span> <span id="s255">I don’t read it well.</span> <span id="s256">I don’t speak it extremely well anymore.</span> <span id="s257">I certainly don’t know any German literature.</span> <span id="s258">We didn’t study it.</span> <span id="s259">We studied some of the Jewish authors.</span> <span id="s260">I didn’t get to study Goethe or Schiller or any of the German culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Do you recall wearing your badge (the yellow Star of David all Jews were required to wear in specific places on their outer garment)?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes, I remember the badge!</span> <span id="s263">By the way my mother made a mistake in her tape; the boys were not called “Ismael” but “Israel”, as the “Jewish” middle name and the women were called “Sarah”.</span> <span id="s264">I do remember having to sign “Hannah, Sarah”.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Do you recall any reaction when that came about, or accepting it as “That is the way it is”?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, that was so.</span> <span id="s267">Essentially you accepted that!</span> <span id="s268">I will not deny that I often hit my name against a stone wall and I get extremely frightened when everyone is so passive about accepting everything.</span> <span id="s269">That just scares me!</span> <span id="s270">I am sure that it goes back to having, down in my subconscious, seen Hitler come to power.</span> <span id="s271">So I will fight much more, just as we did in the case where we were suing the school board.</span> <span id="s272">I said: “They can’t just punch us around!”</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: I was going to ask you about that at the very end; what your reaction was.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: My reaction was that I refused to be pushed around.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Do you recall many of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes, I remember most of my friends.</span> <span id="s277">Many of them ended up in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s278">Sometimes I think about some of them and wonder what has happened to them.</span> <span id="s279">I don’t hear from any of them!</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: You don’t know what happened to any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No!</span> <span id="s282">There is one woman, she was my adopted friend, her name was Gerta.</span> <span id="s283">I corresponded with her.</span> <span id="s284">I have not seen her since we have come to the U.S. I remember her as a 12 year old, but we do correspond.</span> <span id="s285">She lives in Florida.</span> <span id="s286">I remember the really good times we had together!</span> <span id="s287">She had had ballet lessons.</span> <span id="s288">I wanted to have ballet lessons all my life.</span> <span id="s289">We pretended that we were in a ballet class together.</span> <span id="s290">Anyhow I have not seen her, but she is about the only one I have kept in touch with.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: The ballet lessons, were they in the Jewish sphere?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No!</span> <span id="s293">I don’t know how she got them.</span> <span id="s294">She must have gotten to them earlier than I did.</span> <span id="s295">Maybe they had more money.</span> <span id="s296">I do remember some of the people in NYC politics.</span> <span id="s297">In NYC I knew some more people; but, you know, in the Jewish Community in NYC, as in many other communities, you get compared.</span> <span id="s298">I remember someone saying:” So and so is marrying a doctor!”</span> <span id="s299">And “So and so is marrying a lawyer!”</span> <span id="s300">and “Hannah Ebert is only marrying a nice guy!”</span> <span id="s301">So I probably lost contact more in relation to that kind of thing of just marrying a nice Christian boy.</span> <span id="s302">A gentile was, you know, out of the realm of the Jewish community, but not in the relationship to the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s303">My uncle married a gentile, and so on.</span> <span id="s304">I never thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: If we can just go back again, I guess it is most fascinating, the idea of acceptance and what your education was like.</span> <span id="s306">When you went to school to study do you remember whether this was a pleasant or an unpleasant experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A; No, people were like they are; I compare it to slavery in a way.</span> <span id="s308">Within the black culture, the slaves were usually happy and had their security; and that, in a way, was what it was like within the Jewish community in Germany.</span> <span id="s309">(HN seems to miss the target on both sides of her comparison.</span> <span id="s310">No sense of security could exist in the slave society since any master could, at any time, sell any or all slaves when the master wished, disregarding family ties.</span> <span id="s311">Under the Nazi dictatorship any ruffian could assault or arrest any Jew at any time; when Jews left for work particularly after 1938, they never knew whether they would get home again, or, if they did, who would be there.</span> <span id="s312">This is why HN carried all that money around with her).</span> <span id="s313">I felt secure!</span> <span id="s314">I still remember with shock and horror seeing the Temple burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: That was Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes, Nov. 10, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What were your reactions the next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I guess we just came there!</span> <span id="s319">I guess that we did not hear anything during the night!</span> <span id="s320">I was on my way to school when I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: In 1938?</span> <span id="s323">I was 12!</span> <span id="s324">We were on our way to school!</span> <span id="s325">We walked to school in a group, usually (that made it less likely for any one individual to be beaten up) just there is, maybe, safety in numbers.</span> <span id="s326">I remember standing in front of the Temple which was still smoldering.</span> <span id="s327">Obviously there was no school because the men (teachers, administrators, janitors etc.) had been taken away.</span> <span id="s328">That is about the only remembrance I have.</span> <span id="s329">I am trying to think if I can remember a feeling of being afraid.</span> <span id="s330">No, I guess not, more the feeling of disgust and probably some hatred there.</span> <span id="s331">Just being disgusted!</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: What was your feeling when you saw all this?</span> <span id="s333">All the Gestapo people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I was not extremely scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did you get any advice?</span> <span id="s336">Were you ever confronted?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes we were!</span> <span id="s338">You know that everyone gets confronted at times!</span> <span id="s339">No, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s340">Of course, we would get off the sidewalk, if someone came by taunting us; then you stepped off the sidewalk to let the person by; they had the right of way!</span> <span id="s341">A song of the time which had made a strong, strong impression on me went; “Die Gedanken sid frei!”</span> <span id="s342">which translates into “The thoughts are free!”</span> <span id="s343">This meant, I believed, that no one can catch you and punish you for what you are thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: That is a German song?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes, that is a German song.</span> <span id="s346">It means that, no matter what they do, you can hold on to your own thoughts, or maybe just that no one can guess your thoughts, and that, as long as you are strong, strong in your head, you can have your own thoughts, no matter what :”they” say or do.</span> <span id="s347">Yes, that was sort of a theme song of most of my friends</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Do you recall Bar Mitzvahs and religious functions?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: I don’t know of they had Bar Mitzvahs.</span> <span id="s350">They must have had some in the Temple, but I don’t remember attending any (Bar Mitzvahs, other than just the religious service, in that area of Germany, after 1936, were held in the strictest privacy since assemblies of Jews were asking for beatings) but then I was 12 years old, so I was still too young for that.</span> <span id="s351">No, I don’t remember any Bar Mitzvahs!</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Do you remember celebrations of Holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes, I remember going to hear the Shofar being blown (the Shofar, or ram’s horn is blown at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the Jewish New Year as anniversary remembrance of when the ram was provided, on Mt. Tabor to replace Isaac as the “burnt offering”).</span> <span id="s354">I remember some of these things from before I was in the U.S.</span> <span id="s355">The women were sitting upstairs and the men were sitting downstairs in the Temple.</span> <span id="s356">Yes, I remember that, but not anything specific.</span> <span id="s357">I remember Chanukah and Passover.</span> <span id="s358">My parents never set up a Passover meal; we usually had to go out to someone’s house to have a Seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: They didn’t do that because other people did it, or did they just not do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: They didn’t go either.</span> <span id="s361">I mean that I would go but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s362">They would not participate!</span> <span id="s363">Mother would go for the High Holidays (i.e. the Jewish New Year).</span> <span id="s364">On Rosh Hashanah she would go to temple.</span> <span id="s365">As I said that I remember Chanukah at my grandparent’s house, on the eight days everyone lighting the candles and getting gifts, also going into a Succah and having Purim.</span> <span id="s366">However these were not family functions.</span> <span id="s367">I remember the kind of things we did (in the Jewish Day) School.</span> <span id="s368">We did not learn much in school (after 1934 no Jewish teacher could teach in public school, no non-Jewish teacher could teach in a Jewish school, no new Jewish teachers were graduated from the usual normal schools, except one, the younger teachers were amongst the first to leave Germany whenever they could, classes in Jewish schools were often disrupted by incidents and the student population fluctuated due to emigration).</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: You don’t remember your parents making any special emphasis on your Jewishness?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No!</span> <span id="s371">We were Germans first!</span> <span id="s372">We did not really consider ourselves Jewish.</span> <span id="s373">As we got together with the Polish Jews and the Russian Jews of our community, since we were all in the school together, there, there was a certain prejudice (against these “Eastern Jews”).</span> <span id="s374">The German Jews always had their nose up higher than the Polish or Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s375">It took me a long time to realize that the Russian and Polish Jews were also good Jews.</span> <span id="s376">Well, partly, my parents didn’t help with that, they thought that we were superior.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Would you also associate that with the socio-economic position?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: The socio-economic position had something to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Your parents had superior professional occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: What was your mother’s position?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes, I listened to the tapes (of the interview with Margaret Ebert), but I do remember her while I was growing up.</span> <span id="s383">I don’t remember her working in the law firm (obviously meaning Paul Ebert’s law firm) where my father worked, because he quit too early (after 1934 Jews were stripped of their licenses to practice law.</span> <span id="s384">Medicine etc.) and tried to sell insurance.</span> <span id="s385">After that my mother worked for the HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Society) to try to get people out (of Germany).</span> <span id="s386">She never talked much about it, but I remember her being gone late and so on, trying to get people out.</span> <span id="s387">I know that we got our visa to come through Switzerland for emigration was definitely just because she had worked for HIAS (Switzerland was not generous with visas since they wanted no refugees as residents, unless they had independent means).</span> <span id="s388">People were not allowed to go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s389">We had a hard time convincing my mom to leave when she did, even though my grandparents were dead by that time.</span> <span id="s390">(They (her mother’s parents) died in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Of natural death?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s393">My grandparents on my father’s side committed suicide in 1933, but my grandparents on my mother’s side both died in 1939 of natural causes.</span> <span id="s394">On Oct. 8 and Nov. 3, respectively.</span> <span id="s395">My grandfather and then my grandmother.</span> <span id="s396">So they were both gone, but still she really dragged her feet about going.</span> <span id="s397">My, being very forceful and saying; “We are leaving tomorrow, for goodness sake, relax!”</span> <span id="s398">The next couple days everyone was taken to Gurs (that was the camp in Southern France, near Poau, where the Jews from the Mannheim area were shipped, but that did not happen until the surrender of France in June 1940).</span> <span id="s399">Then I insisted that we take that specific boat out of Italy and not to spend any more time in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s400">That was the last boat out of Italy, (in May 1940 Italy attacked France thus entering the war and no boats could go past Gibraltar any longer) got us here.</span> <span id="s401">Really my mom drag her feet and I understand that!</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Why do you think that she was reluctant to leave?</span> <span id="s403">Was she concerned about change?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: No!</span> <span id="s405">No!</span> <span id="s406">She was leaving her homeland (and also abandoning her HIAS clients, for whom she had tried to find a haven), her homeland, Yes!</span> <span id="s407">It is like someone saying to you or me: “Gee, you need to move to New Zealand.”</span> <span id="s408">We would drag our feet too, rather than go to a completely new environment such as South America or Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: You mentioned that your grandparents had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s410">These were your father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Did you know at the time that they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No, I did not and I have no impression except that my father was much less jovial after that.</span> <span id="s414">That was my only impression which I had of that.</span> <span id="s415">I did not know about their suicide until, I believe, after I came to the U.S. I had often wondered: “How come that they both died the same day?</span> <span id="s416">, but I never put one and one together.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: What was your grandfather’s occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: My grandfather on my father’s side was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s419">They all were members of a big association.</span> <span id="s420">There were three or four generations of lawyers.</span> <span id="s421">My father was a lawyer and my uncle was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s422">My grandfather on my mother’s side was a hardware man.</span> <span id="s423">He had a wholesale hardware business.</span> <span id="s424">He also handled iron and had a big hardware store.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Do you recall if either of your grandmothers had gone to the University?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: They were both well-educated people, that is the impression I had.</span> <span id="s427">They knew art and culture.</span> <span id="s428">They were much more cultured than most American educated people, but I am not sure.</span> <span id="s429">No, I don’t know about University studies.</span> <span id="s430">Did mother mention it?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: I really did not ask her that.</span> <span id="s432">It just crossed my mind now.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I think that I will ask my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s434">They are still alive.</span> <span id="s435">Why are you questioning that?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Because you always think about what the men did, but your mother was a professional.</span> <span id="s437">As a matter of fact she made a point of saying that she had received a PHD in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s439">Yes1 I don’t really know, so I will ask my uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s440">It should be interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: There was actually a woman’s right movement in the Weimar republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: I have never felt it.</span> <span id="s443">You know, even in my own mind.</span> <span id="s444">I never felt that I needed authority.</span> <span id="s445">I am sure that I did not get involved.</span> <span id="s446">Yes, my mother cooked, after the maids left, and my grandmother did the same, but there was a certain inequality there.</span> <span id="s447">I never had this feeling of sexual discrimination.</span> <span id="s448">I cannot remember my grandparents on my father’s side, that they needed these women’s rights, as they are needed now.</span> <span id="s449">But that, of course, pertains to the upper class.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Before we leave this subject, it is just fascinating to see how you reacted, or failed to react.</span> <span id="s451">Would I be right in summing up your reaction to this part that you were just very receptive and that you integrated this in your life.</span> <span id="s452">Now you went to Switzerland and then came back.</span> <span id="s453">How did your parents explain this?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Well, they were very honest.</span> <span id="s455">You know, since I was there and Hitler did not like the Jews, that I probably have a better education and that it would be safer for me.</span> <span id="s456">You worried about safety when you were all by yourself and about the safety of your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Where did you go to school in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: I put that out of my mind too because it was such a horrible experience.</span> <span id="s459">No, I never went to school, during these three weeks.</span> <span id="s460">I was just determined to get back.</span> <span id="s461">I didn’t enjoy anything.</span> <span id="s462">The stay in Switzerland was contrary to my parent’s home.</span> <span id="s463">Ours had been a very warm, accepting home; this home in Switzerland was a very cold sterile home and the woman just could not understand my crying.</span> <span id="s464">It was inexplicable to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Was it a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: No, it was a gentile family.</span> <span id="s467">I guess the family was Protestant.</span> <span id="s468">However I don’t think that that would have made much difference.</span> <span id="s469">The home atmosphere was jut so different.</span> <span id="s470">I just really felt that I wanted to be with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: What language did you speak there?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: German!</span> <span id="s473">Yes, the German language was the same and the maid which this family had was lovely.</span> <span id="s474">They had two girls my age.</span> <span id="s475">It must be hard for an only child to, all of a sudden, be a sibling and not only a sibling, but an outsider at that.</span> <span id="s476">These two girls had to accept me at short notice!</span> <span id="s477">I never thought much about that at the time.</span> <span id="s478">I do remember sitting in the railroad station (HN used the German word: “Bahnhoff”, all of a sudden) in Basel and see my mother taking some of her jewelry out of her purse, to take it out of Germany.</span> <span id="s479">There was enough to worry about!</span> <span id="s480">That is how my mother got a lot of her jewelry out of Germany that is by giving it to people in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s481">That was one reason why we came through Switzerland when we left Germany, to pick it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Would you make any other comments about your early life.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Well, I would say that it is better not to go through the experience I had, but I have some real feelings that, if you carry bitterness and hatred around, it tears you up, it does not do anything to anyone else.</span> <span id="s484">It tears your body apart and I had some feelings about that, as I went back to Germany in 1972.</span> <span id="s485">That was the first time I went back alone.</span> <span id="s486">My son was getting married and the wedding was to take place in Denmark.</span> <span id="s487">We couldn’t both go, because we had just gotten Victor, our adopted son.</span> <span id="s488">Three of us going was too much and we couldn’t take Victor and not take Paula.</span> <span id="s489">So, only I went.</span> <span id="s490">After the wedding I went to Germany for four days, just to Karlsruhe to see the old woman who had lived downstairs in the house and had seen me grow up.</span> <span id="s491">It was just fascinating, my feelings, I mean, I would walk around early in the morning, just by myself, and see all the children with their knapsacks.</span> <span id="s492">You know they carried their books that way, on their backs (as HN had done).</span> <span id="s493">I kept wondering and, all of a sudden, I was 12 again and saw the school I had gone to and the bakery and the ice-cream store.</span> <span id="s494">It was just a fascinating thing and I could not understand.</span> <span id="s495">I kept wanting to say: “I was here!”</span> <span id="s496">I had a hard time.</span> <span id="s497">At that time I came from Denmark and people were blonder and more Aryan looking unDenmark, than they are in Southern Germany.</span> <span id="s498">I could not understand how anyone fathomed that!</span> <span id="s499">The other realization was that there were quite a few people who remembered Hitler.</span> <span id="s500">People who had to have been my parents’ age, to really have lived through it (Hitler killed himself in 1945, just 27 years before that visit), however some people had not lived through it.</span> <span id="s501">They had a beautiful new Temple (Temples were rebuilt after the defeat of Germany, but they are mainly museums since hardly any Jews survived in Germany and only a very few old pensioners have returned for economic reasons.</span> <span id="s502">Some former “Displaced Persons” from Eastern Europe took refuge in Mannheim and other parts of the Rhine Valley).</span> <span id="s503">But not in the same location where the old one was.</span> <span id="s504">I talked to the aunt of a girl I had gone to school with.</span> <span id="s505">The girl had died in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s506">The aunt took me to the Temple and we talked for a while.</span> <span id="s507">You know, it is almost as if it never happened.</span> <span id="s508">That is kind of a strange feeling.</span> <span id="s509">Strange is not a good term, it is kind of a nebulous, scary feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Was it a frightening experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yes, it is frightening when I see people so acquiescent to everything, as I said before.</span> <span id="s512">For example our social security law.</span> <span id="s513">We get the social security number.</span> <span id="s514">Now it is being used at Wright State.</span> <span id="s515">You can’t take an exam without giving your social security number.</span> <span id="s516">You can’t get a driver’s license without it.</span> <span id="s517">It is somewhat almost like being dehumanized!</span> <span id="s518">It is scary, but we acquiesce to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Several items you mentioned.</span> <span id="s520">For example you mentioned the fact that your husband is non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: That was by coincidence.</span> <span id="s522">I belonged to a hiking group and it was made up of Jewish kids, at least most of them were Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s523">(Here the tape stops being intelligible).</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: We were on the other side of the tape and I had asked you about the choice of a husband, and you were speaking about a hiking group, maybe we can continue to follow that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: We had an international group, two people from Yugoslavia, there was one young person from Belgium, one from the United States, Austria.</span> <span id="s526">We were twelve altogether, six girls and six boys.</span> <span id="s527">We had more in common than with the American children.</span> <span id="s528">For one thing, the Jewish community was very snobbish.</span> <span id="s529">They didn’t want anything to do with the refugees, the German refugees or any other refugees.</span> <span id="s530">So I went to an agricultural young people’s group and I met these people.</span> <span id="s531">It was not a social group.</span> <span id="s532">We would go on hikes on Saturdays and Sundays, or we would go to concerts or the museums.</span> <span id="s533">That is how we went to Templin, at the School of Living, because they had a School for Living there and we could spend a week for culture between Christmas and New Years.</span> <span id="s534">We went there and we played soccer ball and dodge ball and we went hiking.</span> <span id="s535">It was not a sexual thing, it was just great companions getting together, friends who had a good time together.</span> <span id="s536">I remember Dec. 7, 1941!</span> <span id="s537">We went out hiking in the Palisades park (that is the park which is located just upstream on the Hudson River from Fort Lee, N.J., the Western anchor of the George Washington Bridge) wondering how many people would still be alive after the war.</span> <span id="s538">From there I met some more people who were conscientious objectors during the war.</span> <span id="s539">I just didn’t like the American aggressive manner.</span> <span id="s540">I guess that I met Dick, and I knew that he was my kind.</span> <span id="s541">I met him folk dancing at the Madison Ave. Presbyterian Church (in NYC).</span> <span id="s542">That was the second time he had come there.</span> <span id="s543">He walked me home.</span> <span id="s544">It was really a stormy night.</span> <span id="s545">We walked through Central Park in NYC with twelve inches of snow.</span> <span id="s546">It was so quiet.</span> <span id="s547">We did a lot of talking and we got to know each other better.</span> <span id="s548">Dick and I had a lot in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: If I can interrupt you here; you left Germany in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: In 1940!</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Oh, 1940!</span> <span id="s552">You say that things had gotten worse between 1939 and ’40?</span> <span id="s553">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Maybe we can pick up just a little from there.</span> <span id="s556">What do you remember as getting worse?</span> <span id="s557">Then, when you came to the U.S.?</span> <span id="s558">Well let’s go from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: I was talking about always having a feeling that you didn’t have to be in a synagogue to say your prayers, so that you would be close to God, or to whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s560">I remember that, after having seen the Temple burned, I went biking past the Catholic Church and going into the Church, dipping my hand into the Holy water, doing the Crucifix and genuflecting; then sitting down and saying: “Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echod!”</span> <span id="s561">(This is the watchword of the Jewish faith and is translated into: “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one!”)</span> <span id="s562">and saying my prayers and crying.</span> <span id="s563">You know, being somewhat upset, but saying: “One can talk to God anywhere1 one can be in a Catholic church, as well as in a synagogue.”</span> <span id="s564">I had the feeling that you are a lot better off going back out, out of the church.</span> <span id="s565">That was one of the things I remember.</span> <span id="s566">I wonder if I can thank my parents for that, for having kept me secure, you know, not too ridiculously oriented.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s568">After Kristallnacht, in 1938, can you specifically -- maybe you can mention some specifics of how life was worse for you, or did you become more fearful --was it the diet you had, the clothes you wore, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: After Kristallnacht, you had to wear a star.</span> <span id="s570">I guess that my mother said that she didn’t have to wear one, but I remember wearing the Star of David, but it was in a jewelry form (that contradicts the reminiscences of several others who talk about having to wear armbands with a yellow star as well as clearly visible yellow stars on both the front and the back of the outer garment over the heart, and that these stars had to be worn whenever one was in the presence of others, including in concentration camps) and I was proud to wear it.</span> <span id="s571">You know I did not mind this.</span> <span id="s572">I remember having to sign my name “Sarah” on everything.</span> <span id="s573">It got progressively worse, but so slowly that I don’t remember anything specific.</span> <span id="s574">We still went to school.</span> <span id="s575">There were some more people who had left.</span> <span id="s576">People kept emigrating all along, so the group got smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s577">That was just one of the facts of life!</span> <span id="s578">You know; the group gets smaller and smaller and your friends leave.</span> <span id="s579">Some of them went to South Africa, to England, to Australia or to the U.S.</span> <span id="s580">These were the realities.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: When your friends left, did you correspond at all?</span> <span id="s582">Do you remember getting any mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Do you remember getting any mail from the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: No!</span> <span id="s588">(It was dangerous to receive mail from abroad, all letters were censored).</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Did you have any close friends leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s591">I kind of can’t recall.</span> <span id="s592">It is interesting that when a date comes along -- Oct. 5, or whatever -- I think: “Oh, this is so and so’s birthday!</span> <span id="s593">I wonder whatever happened to them!”</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: You had no idea as to what was happening to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, but I have not heard from them since then.</span> <span id="s596">There were some really close friends who went to South Africa.</span> <span id="s597">I have never heard from them since then, but I remember their birthdays.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: When you left Germany, do you actually remember the trip out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A; No, I don’t remember much about leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s600">I remember being in Italy, in Geneva at the boat dock and my mother having to do something with paperwork.</span> <span id="s601">We had 15 pieces of luggage, a humongous amount these were all their possessions since no furniture, or other goods could be shipped, and they were coming to a country where their resources were limited).</span> <span id="s602">These individual pieces were spread all over the dock.</span> <span id="s603">I remember the Italian men, you know being a young lady (she was then thirteen and a half years old) at the time and flirting with Italian men.</span> <span id="s604">That is how I got the luggage together without me speaking any Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: You don’t remember masses of people who did the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: No, it was a joyful experience.</span> <span id="s607">(By that time the number of people who could leave had dwindled to a trickle).</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Do you recall what you left in your house?</span> <span id="s609">Things which you wanted to take!</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No.</span> <span id="s611">Now I think: “Gee, it would be nice to have this or that.”</span> <span id="s612">I had a beautiful dollhouse, and it would be nice to have.</span> <span id="s613">It was interesting that when I went back to Germany, I went that time with my husband and four children, we stayed with that woman who had a lot of my parent’s silver.</span> <span id="s614">Well, she was having it there, she was pretty senile, and I kept on wanting to take some of these pieces.</span> <span id="s615">She had a set where you put the silver on a silverware holder, made out of silver.</span> <span id="s616">My dad used a plastic one here.</span> <span id="s617">I almost swiped it from her.</span> <span id="s618">My senses just kept me from doing it!</span> <span id="s619">I came back and explained it to my mom and I said:?</span> <span id="s620">Oh, that used to be ours!”</span> <span id="s621">Well, in hindsight, I wish that I had swiped it (as per the German post 1946 law of restitution, or Wiedergutmachungsgesetz, all these items belonged again to the Ebert family, unless they sold it freely after WWII).</span> <span id="s622">She wouldn’t have known the difference anyway.</span> <span id="s623">You know: she had a lot of my parent’s things and it was fun seeing them.</span> <span id="s624">She had a plate and a foot mat, which I had made for my parents when I was about six.</span> <span id="s625">She gave that to me and it was nice.</span> <span id="s626">However I don’t know, it isn’t anything that important.</span> <span id="s627">I wouldn’t change my life</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: When you came to the U.S., did you have some of your family greet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: My father was at dockside.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Your father had left earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A; He had been in Scotland.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Your father was in Scotland?</span> <span id="s633">When had he left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Sometime in 1939.</span> <span id="s635">Then the war started.</span> <span id="s636">I do remember that, after the war started, my mother was not able to talk to my father and was not able to write to him (Scotland and Germany were on opposite sides of the conflict).</span> <span id="s637">My mother had to write to Switzerland and they would put it in an envelope and to mail it to England or to Scotland.</span> <span id="s638">Then dad would write to Switzerland and they would put it in a different envelope and send it to Germany.</span> <span id="s639">(This kind of exchange was probably not that straightforward due to censorship!</span> <span id="s640">either letters were copied or summarized -- exchanging letters with people in enemy countries was not tolerated by either side).</span> <span id="s641">That is how my parents communicated.</span> <span id="s642">I remember that mother tended to worry about that, you know, how could communication be maintained.</span> <span id="s643">My father came to the U.S. in April of 1940, and we came in May of 1940.</span> <span id="s644">My father was at the dock.</span> <span id="s645">That was nice.</span> <span id="s646">I remember the joyful waving!</span> <span id="s647">“How do you like America?”</span> <span id="s648">is what he shouted at us.</span> <span id="s649">That is about the only remembrance I have, and then adjusting to NYC.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Were your associations Jewish?</span> <span id="s651">The Ethical Culture Society was your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No, that was the social group.</span> <span id="s653">I went to Julia Richmond High School in NYC.</span> <span id="s654">That is the high school where I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Did you not discriminate?</span> <span id="s656">I mean did you seek Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: This was not on your mind one-way or the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: No, I still felt Jewish and I guess that I will always feel Jewish, I mean that we raised our children to celebrate the Holy Days, like Chanukah and Passover.</span> <span id="s660">Paula stayed home from school yesterday, which was Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s661">Even the children who are gone (i.e. who no longer live at home) and who have gentile mates, still talk about Passover.</span> <span id="s662">Becky still does the Seder (literally Seder literally means “order.”</span> <span id="s663">The order of the Passover meal is fairly rigidly stated in the literature and, therefore, “doing the Seder” implies some conscious commitment, at least).</span> <span id="s664">It is a bastardized Seder, but it is a Seder.</span> <span id="s665">You know; they talk about it and she will have friends in.</span> <span id="s666">Tommy took a menorah (the traditional Chanukah candle holder with spaces for nine flames, generally nine candles) back to Denmark with him, which he remembered from his childhood.</span> <span id="s667">As I said, they have a Jewish tradition and I feel that we managed to deal in that respect with the Jewish heritage, which they have, just like they have a strong American Methodist heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Let me ask you; you went to public school and your extracurricular, your social affiliation, your religious affiliation, was the Ethical Culture Society and you mentioned that you had become acquainted with your future husband, who was a conscientious objector, and that you had met other conscientious objectors.</span> <span id="s669">What was your feeling since the war was going on at the time?</span> <span id="s670">Did you have a concern about the condition of the people you left behind (in Germany)?</span> <span id="s671">Did you feel that we should go and help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s673">I see what you mean.</span> <span id="s674">You mean; how can I justify my Judaism and adopt Pacifism at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Did you think every day, every week about what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A; I mean; most of the Jews were already deported (that certainly was not the case by Dec. 7, 1941).</span> <span id="s677">I felt that the U.S. was partly, and other countries also were to blame.</span> <span id="s678">For one thing, they let Hitler go awfully far (presumably in order to stop the Communist menace) and, by the way Hitler did some good things for Germany.</span> <span id="s679">You know that he did start the Volkswagen, and there were some good things happening inside Germany.</span> <span id="s680">I mean politically, oh not politically as much as economically (in the early and middle 20’s the German economy had fallen victim to runaway inflation due in great part to the costs of WWI).</span> <span id="s681">I didn’t have the feeling that he did not encourage the Jews to leave.</span> <span id="s682">(As a matter of fact the official policy of Hitler’s party, the Nazi party, was to get as many Jews as possible to leave Germany providing they left their worldly goods to the Nazis, rather than to Germany.</span> <span id="s683">It was only once Germany overran Europe, thus reacquiring these same Jews who were by then without means, that the “Final Solution” was adopted as official policy in 1942).</span> <span id="s684">Some of the people like my parents were reluctant to leave.</span> <span id="s685">Once they wanted to leave there was the “Quota System.”</span> <span id="s686">(By the laws of 1921, revised in 1927 the U.S. would only admit a specific number of immigrants each year, based on quotas by nationalities.</span> <span id="s687">Other countries regulated immigration by other means) New Zealand and Australia didn’t take people.</span> <span id="s688">Canada took some in.</span> <span id="s689">England would take them, but the British colonies would not, (actually Australia as well as England accepted people qualified in certain professions.</span> <span id="s690">South Africa took in many refugees.</span> <span id="s691">Palestine took in only very few people after 1936, when the riots occurred, except for youngsters, to give some examples.</span> <span id="s692">Also France would accept people, but refused them the right to be employees).</span> <span id="s693">It was not just Germany that had its dislike; there is anti-Semitism here, in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: When you came here, did you sever your ties with those people you left behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: There weren’t any people left.</span> <span id="s696">There was no one left.</span> <span id="s697">(HN probably means that there was no one left whom she knew.</span> <span id="s698">Her mother detailed some of her HIAS clients who were left.</span> <span id="s699">Many Jews from HN’s area of Germany were deported including these who went to Gurs after May 1940).</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: I terms of the U.S. getting involved in the war and perhaps liberating camps (camps were not liberated until late in 1944, at the earliest), was that not necessary?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: I still have the feeling that I think that some could have gotten out.</span> <span id="s702">Actually I didn’t have that feeling (when I met Dick); by then I had already met Ralph and Lila Templing who had a real influence on my life.</span> <span id="s703">He is a strong believer in the Gandhi- non-violent culture.</span> <span id="s704">He had known Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi, the ultimate proponent of passive resistance, of non-violence.</span> <span id="s705">He was a great person.</span> <span id="s706">He explained the Trinity to my satisfaction, to my Jewish satisfaction and laid the groundwork to my understanding pacifism a lot more, that is the non-violent approach.</span> <span id="s707">So, when I met Richard, I was ready.</span> <span id="s708">You know; they are not proselytizing.</span> <span id="s709">His whole life is that he will not kill.</span> <span id="s710">You know; he won’t lay a hand on his children, or such.</span> <span id="s711">He has a non-violent approach.</span> <span id="s712">I really appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Was that not in the way in which the Jews handled themselves in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s715">It was almost too passive.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: So, did that present a conflict for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Do you think that the Jews should have behaved in another way, in Germany, when it was all happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I think that they could have been stronger.</span> <span id="s720">I mean that they were pretty acquiescing.</span> <span id="s721">I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: I wonder how you integrate the fact of people being acquiescing with your non-violent doctrine?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Between acquiescing and non-violence there is a step!</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Could you illustrate this?</span> <span id="s725">Have you worked that out?</span> <span id="s726">I wonder how you rationalize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes, I have worked it out, but I am not sure that I can put it into words.</span> <span id="s728">I think that there is a difference between the idea of non-violence and acquiescence.</span> <span id="s729">You don’t have to cooperate to be non-violent.</span> <span id="s730">There is a fine line and I have not done that much thinking about it in order to explain it.</span> <span id="s731">I am trying to think of something.</span> <span id="s732">I think that if someone came up and assaulted me, I would not fight, I would probably scream and give them the money and protect myself that way, since obviously I am too weak to fight.</span> <span id="s733">It does not take any sense to go and hit!</span> <span id="s734">There are other ways of defending yourself and I think that this is the case in the whole country.</span> <span id="s735">I think that if the Jews had maybe more united amongst themselves they could have done something, but that is hard to tell.</span> <span id="s736">It is water over the dam.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Essentially then during the 40’s, during the war, you were part of the Ethical Culture movement and you really swayed towards pacifism?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes, toward pacifism.</span> <span id="s739">Maybe that was because I appreciated the young men I had met.</span> <span id="s740">Remember that I was a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: And you didn’t argue with him, what about the Jews and all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: No.</span> <span id="s743">Well they were already saved; some of the people had already come.</span> <span id="s744">When France was overtaken, that was before America joined the war.</span> <span id="s745">French Jews had been liberated (that is contrary to the fact since, starting with the fall of France in May-June 1940 and accelerating after our invasion of North Africa in 1943, when the Germans overran even the small enclave controlled by Marshal Petain in Vichy, Jews were deported by trainloads into slave labor camps and extermination camps, starting with the German and other Jews who had found refuge in France since the end of WWI).</span> <span id="s746">You know, America did not stumble into the war (Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. after the U.S. had declared war on Japan after Pearl Harbor).</span> <span id="s747">That is such a mute question!</span> <span id="s748">I do have feelings about my children being in the armed forces, I don’t think there should be a draft.</span> <span id="s749">I have some very strong feelings about that.</span> <span id="s750">My boys, the elder boys, were all registered as conscientious objectors.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: From 1940 to 1945 were you, or your family involved in any sort of negotiations, or any sort of assistance or being mentally or, in any way involved, with what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Oh my mother was very much involved, but she has always been much more of a political person than I am.</span> <span id="s753">Well mom and dad were involved.</span> <span id="s754">They had met Ralph and Lila Templin also, and I am certain that that had some influence.</span> <span id="s755">My parents were very good friends with them.</span> <span id="s756">Ralph is a very charismatic person.</span> <span id="s757">I mentioned John Hayne Holmes, the minister of the Community Church (a name is added here which the transcriber could not pick up, it may have been the name of another person, or the location of the Community Church).</span> <span id="s758">All the people really had a strong philosophy.</span> <span id="s759">There is a difference between a whole country starting a war, or even fighting a war, and individuals.</span> <span id="s760">There is a definite difference between an individual defending himself or a whole country.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: You mean to say that, if you had your preference the U.s. would not have gotten involved in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: No, I am not saying that.</span> <span id="s763">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s764">I don’t have an opinion either way.</span> <span id="s765">I mean that I had not reflected on this, I was young.</span> <span id="s766">I would have an opinion now, over something which was happening now.</span> <span id="s767">No, I hadn’t thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: But at the time, were you thinking of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: No.</span> <span id="s770">I was glad that they (meaning the U.S.) had joined the war.</span> <span id="s771">That disparity between my thoughts and with my husband’s or boy friend’s strong feelings -- I never thought about that.</span> <span id="s772">You know how these things go.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Sure, as a young teenager you don’t rationalize that much!</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Sure, at the age of 16, you don’t think about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Let me ask you now, in terms of that whole experience and on how it has affected your life; at that time there were many Americans in uniform.</span> <span id="s776">Do men in uniform trouble you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: You don’t recall anything like that?</span> <span id="s779">Marching and that.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No.</span> <span id="s781">Well, I don’t like goose- stepping (the parade march of the German soldiers with legs raised to 90 deg.</span> <span id="s782">From the vertical which was never used by the U.S.) I never encouraged boy scouts and girl scouts for my children.</span> <span id="s783">It is interesting.</span> <span id="s784">Maybe that was a reaction to the atmosphere in Germany, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s785">A policeman does not scare me, a doctor does not scare me!</span> <span id="s786">I think that my experience has been that I have a very strong self-image actually.</span> <span id="s787">I fight for what I believe is my right.</span> <span id="s788">You know; they can put me in prison and I will stick to what I believe!</span> <span id="s789">Hopefully Dick and I have brought this over to my children: “This, above all, to thy own self be true!”</span> <span id="s790">You have to be true to your feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Oh yes, the question I have is this: how did your experience, your early experience, affect your child raising practices?</span> <span id="s792">Do you see a relationship about what happened to you and how you brought your children up?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: No, I have always been pretty individualistic.</span> <span id="s794">I mean Dick and I, both.</span> <span id="s795">We don’t follow the crowd.</span> <span id="s796">I am not sure that that has anything to do with that, or if there are other reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Psychological?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: You know, I don’t have to keep up with the Jones and neither does Richard.</span> <span id="s799">That may have to do with the influence of Ralph and Lila Templin or (here is another name which the transcriber could not understand).</span> <span id="s800">When we came to Yellow Springs we raised our children, we wanted them to be something.</span> <span id="s801">There was no Unitarian Church, at the time, so we did join Quaker Meetings.</span> <span id="s802">I consider myself a Jewish Quaker.</span> <span id="s803">I have some feelings about organized religion, in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: I was going to talk to you about this afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I feel that no matter how, what, who, I am pretty much of an individualist and I don’t approve of some of the things the Quakers, or anyone else does in organized religion.</span> <span id="s806">So we are not very active .</span> <span id="s807">we are active but we don’t go to meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Are you active in the social concerns?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Yes, with social concerns, but I am not for any religious activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Do you think that this was caused by what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s812">I have strong feelings about pro-choice for abortions.</span> <span id="s813">I think that the state government needs to stay out of your own personal life.</span> <span id="s814">It should not dictate; abortion is one of these things, not to be allowed to commit suicide is another, having to wear helmets, when you ride a bicycle is another.</span> <span id="s815">That should be your own, private, choice.</span> <span id="s816">Maybe that comes from Hitler wanting to run your whole life, but it may have happened anyways.</span> <span id="s817">We have raised our children with respect for human beings.</span> <span id="s818">When we adopted Victor we had to go through a whole bunch of meetings with the Children’s Mental Health Service in Dayton, or in Montgomery County (the county where Dayton is located).</span> <span id="s819">I went to a lot of meetings.</span> <span id="s820">We had to go through an encounter session with King -- I can’t remember his first name -- he would always say: “Pretend you are black!”</span> <span id="s821">, or such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Victor is a black child?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Victor is a black child.</span> <span id="s824">I could not see myself being a Jive- Jewish- black mother, going jiving along.</span> <span id="s825">That is not my nature.</span> <span id="s826">We were rather blunt about that and we almost did not get a child because we said that we had some questions.</span> <span id="s827">We were going to raise a human being, like any other human being.</span> <span id="s828">We were not raising a “Black’ human being, or a “Yellow” human being.</span> <span id="s829">We were going to raise Victor as a human being.</span> <span id="s830">That it is black is secondary, just like the fact we are white is secondary, he is a human being.</span> <span id="s831">We almost did not get a child, though.</span> <span id="s832">Seeing Victor, now, at 13, not to brag, I think we have succeeded, he is a delightful young adolescent.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Well, from what I perceive, I agree with that.</span> <span id="s834">Let me ask you with regard to your children, and your own commitment, how do you feel about patriotism and loyalty to one’s country?</span> <span id="s835">Or are these issues you don’t deal with?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Oh I do!</span> <span id="s837">I do.</span> <span id="s838">We vote!</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Do you think of yourself as an American, or do you think of yourself as a member of a larger community?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I think of myself as an American, although I am not a very patriotic American.</span> <span id="s841">I will not wave a flag.</span> <span id="s842">I feel strongly that everyone should vote!</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: You mentioned that your children are conscientious objectors.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes, and we are working on Victor.</span> <span id="s845">That goes with Quakerism and, maybe, that is what I like about the Quaker approach.</span> <span id="s846">There are other ways of saving humanity besides fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Would that be applicable to what happened in Germany, do you think?</span> <span id="s848">Or is it something you haven’t thought about?</span> <span id="s849">Or are you not relating the two?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yes, I heard from someone who lived through the war in Norway and Germany --Germany having conquered Norway during the spring of 1940 -- that person said that the Norwegians about whom we are talking thought about it.</span> <span id="s851">She was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s852">She was a Quaker, a Norwegian Quaker.</span> <span id="s853">They used the passive resistance approach, the non-violent approach I guess, against the Germans.</span> <span id="s854">They just did not cooperate.</span> <span id="s855">(That however was by no means the attitude of the majority of the Norwegians who used their rugged countryside, with easy contact to seaborne British support to harass the German occupiers).</span> <span id="s856">The American Revolution got started by us not cooperating with buying English goods and not cooperating with the stamp act.</span> <span id="s857">Just, while teaching American history, I was thinking about that.</span> <span id="s858">The Boston Tea Party was a non-violent action.</span> <span id="s859">Eventually something happens.</span> <span id="s860">It’s sort of mute.</span> <span id="s861">History did not turn out that way.</span> <span id="s862">I don’t know what would have happened.</span> <span id="s863">I am sure that the Germans, eventually, would have -- or someone else would have done Hitler in.</span> <span id="s864">Hitler was already done in by the time America entered the war.</span> <span id="s865">That is sort of a mute question.</span> <span id="s866">What would have happened if?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Let me just ask you two basic questions here.</span> <span id="s868">How do you feel about Israel?</span> <span id="s869">Do you have a loyalty to Israel?</span> <span id="s870">An interest in Israel?</span> <span id="s871">Specifically coming back to your Zionist days?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I am not a Zionist.</span> <span id="s873">I have cousins over there.</span> <span id="s874">I guess that I admire Israel.</span> <span id="s875">I think that they do some stupid things at times.</span> <span id="s876">I wish that they were slightly more non-violent, quite often, but at the same time there is a certain vivaciousness, a certain excitement there.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Do you personally identify with Israel, as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Do you refrain from debating Israel because you are a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: No!</span> <span id="s881">No!</span> <span id="s882">It is interesting though.</span> <span id="s883">I would sometime, maybe, like to see it, to visit there.</span> <span id="s884">Just out of curiosity.</span> <span id="s885">No, I would not want to go there.</span> <span id="s886">No, I am an American.</span> <span id="s887">No, there are other places where I would rather live, if I had to live elsewhere, besides Israel.</span> <span id="s888">I am saying that now.</span> <span id="s889">I would be unhappy if my children went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: It seems at this point we are entering a new concern about nuclear war.</span> <span id="s891">In your perception of world affairs do you have any fears growing out of your earlier experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: I have fears!</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: We all have fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: I have strong feelings about Reagan.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Do you think that it is all related to what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: I would say that I was almost too young for that, but everything shapes out of your early childhood.</span> <span id="s897">OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: You don’t get any anxiety because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: No.</span> <span id="s900">I am not about to dive into an air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s901">We have not built an air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s902">My son David has some land in British Columbia which I am urging him not to sell.</span> <span id="s903">It is someplace to go, if things get worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: When we hear about the pending disaster, is there any recall to your early experience or how you deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No!</span> <span id="s906">No!</span> <span id="s907">I think that I pretty much deal with it as reality.</span> <span id="s908">In my dealings with kids and with psychology I realize that reality is that we are here.</span> <span id="s909">What happened before shapes your life, but you can’t change that.</span> <span id="s910">Put all of that behind you!</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: But there is no di8fferent feeling because of it.</span> <span id="s912">You mentioned the acquiescence.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yes, there are things for which I will fight.</span> <span id="s914">Sometimes I fight things.</span> <span id="s915">I tend to be a fighter and I think that this is partly because of having seen the acquiescence before.</span> <span id="s916">How can you modify your opinion easily?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: My last question is, and you alluded to the answer several times in what you said.</span> <span id="s918">I was going to ask you whether what happened to you as a child has strengthened your ability to cope or weakened you.</span> <span id="s919">Obviously you are a stronger person because of the experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yes, I am sure that you asked me this before.</span> <span id="s921">The two things which are guidelines for me are: In my youth it was, as I said: “Die Gedanken sind frei!”</span> <span id="s922">meaning: “The thoughts are free and no one can catch them, no one can guess them; you can have them at any time and they are yours.”</span> <span id="s923">I feel that very strongly.</span> <span id="s924">In later years it has been a poem by Ian Malcolm (transcriber is not certain of the name) which goes: “I admit it, he drew a circle which shut me out Heretic rebelled the thing to flaunt But Levin had the wit to run We drew a circle which took him in.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">That sort of stayed with me as well as some of the other sayings of Templin.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: That is a fine conclusion which I have had and I thank you.</span> <span id="s927">It has been a fine experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Well, thank you.</span> <span id="s929">Thank you for this interview.</span> <span id="s930">It is kind of neat to have to think about it, so I should thank you.</span> <span id="s931">It also has helped me in clearing my thoughts.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: If you want to, at any time, to tell us things which came up, I would be most appreciative.</span> <span id="s933">It has been a most reflective experience.</span></p></body></html>
