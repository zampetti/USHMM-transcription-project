id="s330">And then they give me some rubber to put on my feet -- I mean the [indecipherable] that’s what I put on my feet.</span> <span id="s331">So then another guy came in and he got out -- took a tire and took out -- cut a tire and made a piece of rubber, and I -- that’s what I put them on, on my feet, and that’s what I used to walk, on the rubber.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: How did --

wanted, give something to me too.</span> <span id="s353">So he was giving more to me than he took for himself.</span> <span id="s354">The other people that were hiding, they took away everything with them, used to beat them up, you know.</span> <span id="s355">I was okay with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So you had some protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: A little,

then you go, and you walk in and you walk [indecipherable] to the police and he said to me, anybody makes one step behind is gonna be killed, you know?</span> <span id="s366">So a lot of people do it,

id="s912">Q: You -- you -- you were involved in black marketeering.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: So what happened when the plan fell through to go to Israel -- to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: What [indecipherable] but my sister told me that it’s a good thing you didn’t come over here, because then I have pay a lot of money take out the trucks.</span> <span id="s916">And it’s hard to make a living there, in Israel right now.</span> <span id="s917">And my uncle wrote the letter to come over here.</span> <span id="s918">I didn’t know what he is doing.</span> <span id="s919">He brought me into his house, you know, the big f -- big house, took me in and my wife, and at that time I came, I had my son with me.</span> <span id="s920">We stayed with them.</span> <span id="s921">It didn’t work out too good, because he, my uncle, is -- his niece was a single girl.</span> <span id="s922">When they brought me in over here, they always had in the mind I’m going to come in, marry that girl.</span> <span id="s923">When I brought my wife, wasn’t so -- they weren’t too happy.</span> <span id="s924">So when I find out what it is, I decided to move to go someplace else.</span> <span id="s925">So a friend of mine was from my own town, and he knew that I’m not getting along, but no fights, just I know that it’s not a good feeling there.</span> <span id="s926">So he said, move into my house.</span> <span id="s927">He has a one bedroom house, and I moved in in the living room, we had a bed on the floor and we stayed together for a little bit.</span> <span id="s928">Then I got in -- I met a guy that is looking for a job, so I find out the guy has a [indecipherable], and his wife was my older sister’s best girlfriend in Koretz.</span> <span id="s929">So when he finds I’m over here, so he can start talk to me, what do you want to do in America?</span> <span id="s930">I says, I will do anything, I just want a job.</span> <span id="s931">So he took me out one day, he drove around with me.</span> <span id="s932">He said, I’m building here and I’m building -- it was a big building.</span> <span id="s933">And then we pass by a lumber yard that says a -- a few Jewish people working over there, I -- I couldn’t speak nothing in English, you know.</span> <span id="s934">He said, maybe you want to work over here, I says good.</span> <span id="s935">So, next morning I went to work over there.</span> <span id="s936">And I worked there for a few months, and before [indecipherable] he came into me one day, he says, everybody likes you over here.</span> <span id="s937">I want you to be the buyer to buy the lumber.</span> <span id="s938">I said, buy the lumber for what?</span> <span id="s939">I don’t know how to talk.</span> <span id="s940">How do you gonna buy it?</span> <span id="s941">He said, well, I’ll hire, I got a girl over here, a Polish girl, and she’ll work with you together.</span> <span id="s942">You do the buying.</span> <span id="s943">I says, you’re making fun of me.</span> <span id="s944">He said no.</span> <span id="s945">So, before I turn around they made me the foreman, then I started doing the buying in the lumber yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: What did you speak?</span> <span id="s947">What language?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Mostly Jewish, and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: But you -- so you knew Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: But -- but not English or German?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No, not enough English, nothing.</span> <span id="s953">So, we worked there for awhile, and came back Christmastime, and I couldn’t go, I couldn’t drive, I didn’t have no license or nothing.</span> <span id="s954">So a guy used to pick me up all the time, take me back to work.</span> <span id="s955">And this was about 20 miles.</span> <span id="s956">But the guy was nice to doing it, because [indecipherable] the boss in there.</span> <span id="s957">But by about two years I was working over there, and everybody find out with me I’m a good worker.</span> <span id="s958">And they don’t pay me too much.</span> <span id="s959">As [indecipherable] pay me 50 dollars a week, seven days a week, and I didn’t care, I make maybe [indecipherable] somebody else [indecipherable] 75 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s960">So I go back to him, I tell, Harry, I says 75 dollars.</span> <span id="s961">He says, Do-Don’t worry about, I’ll give you 75.</span> <span id="s962">And then I want -- had -- need a car, so I got -- I got [indecipherable] license, I bought an old car, and I have to pay for the car, it’s 800 dollars.</span> <span id="s963">I haven’t got no money.</span> <span id="s964">So they say, we’re gonna loan you the money, and we’ll take off 20 dollars a week for your salaries.</span> <span id="s965">Okay.</span> <span id="s966">So it goes by a week, two, three, they’re not taking out the money.</span> <span id="s967">So I go back to him, I says, wait a minute, I can’t afford it, you didn’t take out the money.</span> <span id="s968">[indecipherable] the money, you’re supposed to take it from the -- my salary.</span> <span id="s969">Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it.</span> <span id="s970">He says, you have to pay right now for the four weeks.</span> <span id="s971">Well, okay, I have to, I have to, take it all, the whole thing, you know.</span> <span id="s972">And then [indecipherable] he said no, don’t worry about it, the car is a present for you.</span> <span id="s973">You know, that made -- made a -- a big deal, yeah.</span> <span id="s974">And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard [indecipherable] the two partners.</span> <span id="s975">They fight -- fighting between them and he come to me and says to me, you know what?</span> <span id="s976">We closing up the place.</span> <span id="s977">I want you to go into business.</span> <span id="s978">You take over the place.</span> <span id="s979">I says, I’m gonna take over the place?</span> <span id="s980">I ain’t got no money.</span> <span id="s981">Then he says, well, we’ll work it out somehow.</span> <span id="s982">So, he went, he brought me another guy, he says, that guy’s gonna go in partners with you.</span> <span id="s983">So another guy comes in the partners and start talking to me.</span> <span id="s984">He say, we’re gonna go into business, does he have any money.</span> <span id="s985">I says no, do you have any money?</span> <span id="s986">He says no.</span> <span id="s987">So what are we going?</span> <span id="s988">Says well, the people what you deal with them with buying, go into Mr. Martin, tell him that you want to go into business.</span> <span id="s989">So I go and tell the guys they’re gonna go in business.</span> <span id="s990">He says okay -- I-I -- I was buying for them.</span> <span id="s991">He says, show me your statement.</span> <span id="s992">I said, what’s a statement?</span> <span id="s993">I didn’t know nothing [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s994">So I stayed with them for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and going to the -- to the banker that didn’t know me from somebody -- from the other people.</span> <span id="s995">I said the same thing, I want to go into business, but I need money.</span> <span id="s996">Said the same thing, give me a statement.</span> <span id="s997">So, I don’t know what you’re talking about.</span> <span id="s998">Make the story short, the guy gave me 3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me 3,000 dollars credit.</span> <span id="s999">And we got [indecipherable] in the business, had good customers, the [indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me every week.</span> <span id="s1000">So I got in business and that’s -- I’m still in the same business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: I need to
