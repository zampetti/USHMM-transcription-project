start -- for the record, I need you to state your name, where you were born, what year.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name is Samuel Flor.</span> <span id="s12">I was born in .</span> <span id="s13">This is a town which has her name according to the little river which flowed through the city.</span> <span id="s14">And from , we went -- it's about halfway between Chenlavich (ph.) and Dornavortra (ph.).</span> <span id="s15">And Dornavortra was a famous where the people came and stood there for four weeks or six weeks and drank some stinky water.</span> <span id="s16">It was miserable.</span> <span id="s17">And I couldn't stand it, but I drank it because there said I have to drink and it makes me healthy.</span> <span id="s18">So after it made me healthy, I was very happy.</span> <span id="s19">Then I went --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s21">Just what -- what year were you born and what country, at that time were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: At the time, the whole territory was Austria and the country was Romania.</span> <span id="s23">It was Romania because this was not our country.</span> <span id="s24">But by that time, you could also go to Romania without a passport because they saw this is a good place because the is very important for the health of the people.</span> <span id="s25">Even King Carl, the Romanian king, used it and drank this water which they called It was a terrible stench but only little children could taste the terrible stench because they are still dumb.</span> <span id="s26">And so we drank this water with the terrible strength and then we said we felt good.</span> <span id="s27">So wonderful.</span> <span id="s28">We are terrific with this water.</span> <span id="s29">Now, this water was like a rusty iron and we drank this rusty iron and we were happy that we drank something which made us just a healthy and as good as the king from Romanian who drank this water.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: So you were born in what year in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: 1930 -- no, I -- I have to think a little because I didn't have the correct time -- yes, in 1930.</span> <span id="s32">Q: 1908?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: 1908?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yeah, 1308, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: 1908.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: 1908, yeah.</span> <span id="s38">No, you're right, yeah.</span> <span id="s39">And this today is a very, very long figure to say that I'm born 1308.</span> <span id="s40">Somebody told me, "My goodness, you don't belong here.</span> <span id="s41">You belong to the -- to the cemetery."</span> <span id="s42">No, I don't belong to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s43">I'm here and I am all right and that's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s45">So tell me, when you were a boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: -- things changed, you're country changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Absolutely, because when I was 12 years old, my country became Romanian.</span> <span id="s49">And now it was you needed a passport to go there.</span> <span id="s50">You couldn't go like before to Romania and you say, "I'm a Romanian."</span> <span id="s51">No.</span> <span id="s52">I was an Austrian.</span> <span id="s53">Now, I am in Romanian and I have to pay for a visa and I have to have a passport to go get into this beloved town, which was very famous all over.</span> <span id="s54">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: But you became a Romanian citizen?</span> <span id="s56">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: So what did you need a passport for?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I need the passport for to go to Romanian because I still lived in Austria.</span> <span id="s59">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: But when you were 12 years old, didn't where you live become Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s63">Then this town where I live now become Romania and now I don't need a passport to go to Romania because I'm a Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: What -- explain to me what this meant, that all of the sudden you were a Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: It meant that the laws, which I don't know at all, I was forbidden to throw stones, because when I threw stones and I got paddled on my behind from a policeman.</span> <span id="s66">And this was all of the punishment I got.</span> <span id="s67">So therefore, I'm Romanian which was paddled by a Romanian policeman and he didn't get punished for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: How did you learn that you were a Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: On all the street corners, the street names were changed.</span> <span id="s70">They didn't change the house numbers.</span> <span id="s71">They stayed the same.</span> <span id="s72">Now I was born in in Number Five.</span> <span id="s73">But this Number Five stayed all the time, so I knew I'm a Romanian citizen and I have to sing a new national anthem and we sang it because we were told we have to love the king, so we loved him.</span> <span id="s74">And here I know that means "Long live the King."</span> <span id="s75">And if he lives long, I'm a Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: You were telling me that one day you went to school -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: -- and you learned you were Romanian and you went home and told your family you're a Romanian now?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s79">When I came home -- my father was dead already, I lost him right after the first World War -- and I said, "Mother, you know we are Romanians."</span> <span id="s80">She said, "How do you know this?"</span> <span id="s81">"Teacher said so."</span> <span id="s82">"No, the teacher said so, it cannot be.</span> <span id="s83">The teacher must make a mistake."</span> <span id="s84">"No, mother.</span> <span id="s85">Look, I will show you.</span> <span id="s86">Come out and I show you new street signs."</span> <span id="s87">Mother came out and didn't believe me, but then she read by herself.</span> <span id="s88">The Street of Michael the Brave.</span> <span id="s89">So I kept this and I know from time I was born Number Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: How did this change of nationality affect you, other than street signs?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: It affect me so that I was sitting and trying as much as possible to learn the few words.</span> <span id="s92">Number Five.</span> <span id="s93">And I learned it and it was very nice for me so I could remember it.</span> <span id="s94">And my tongue worked like a Romanian tongue, so it was all right and I was very proud of -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: But what kind of changes did you all have to go through?</span> <span id="s96">I mean, was it difficult?</span> <span id="s97">Was it complicated?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Oh, yes, it was very difficult because I had to learn that if I cannot speak these words correctly, I get 25 over my behind.</span> <span id="s99">I was paddled 25 times as the whole class looked on.</span> <span id="s100">And I was paddled one after the other.</span> <span id="s101">So I had to feel it and I couldn't sit very long after this.</span> <span id="s102">But it was all right.</span> <span id="s103">So we made fun of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did the mood of the city change?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s106">People went silent and thoughtful.</span> <span id="s107">They wouldn't stop the war.</span> <span id="s108">And then they laughed about this new different idea of the let's say the life of the Romanian because they couldn't speak.</span> <span id="s109">Nobody knew what he talked, nobody knew what he said and nobody knew what it means, what he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: What about regulations or --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Oh, no, we learned this just by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Were there any new laws instituted that you had to deal with?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: There were new laws instituted because I didn't use them.</span> <span id="s114">I couldn't use them because I didn't know what they meant.</span> <span id="s115">And I tried very hard but it was all right and it was fun for us.</span> <span id="s116">We all learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: What about laws pertaining to Jewish people?</span> <span id="s118">Did that change with the Romanian Government?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s120">Laws which pertained to Jewish people was that they cannot go at six in the morning to pray.</span> <span id="s121">They had to go at seven because it was a law, it has to be.</span> <span id="s122">And then came the other law that they have to pray shorter, cannot pray so long and cannot use the synagogue for four hours or five hours.</span> <span id="s123">And this was a very tough law for us because we used the synagogue all day.</span> <span id="s124">But it was contained to four hours.</span> <span id="s125">Q: Did this impact your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: It impact my family because my father was a watchmaker.</span> <span id="s127">Watchmaker was called the man who repairs a watch.</span> <span id="s128">So it impaired my father very much and he was swearing in German because he couldn't speak Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So your father was still living when Romania -- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What other -- what other sort of official actions were taken that affected the Jewish community under Romania at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">The idea of using the synagogue shorter and living in this town, which was -- had quite a Jewish population, the idea was that we had to obey these laws.</span> <span id="s133">And we knew very well that if we don't obey it will be something bad.</span> <span id="s134">But we knew it that they who didn't obey these laws, they have also 25.</span> <span id="s135">It was called .</span> <span id="s136">Those that they changed, it means 25.</span> <span id="s137">And this you will suffer yourself.</span> <span id="s138">And they, especially the Jews, didn't like it.</span> <span id="s139">But not many got beaten 25 times on their behind.</span> <span id="s140">So it was an example for the whole population.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Now, the Romanian -- were you in at this point?</span> <span id="s142">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Were the Romanians particularly anti-Semitic at that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s145">They were used to live with the Jews because without the Jews it's no fun.</span> <span id="s146">But they needed the Jews for handing out 25.</span> <span id="s147">And they knew it right away, who would get it?</span> <span id="s148">The Jew.</span> <span id="s149">This was very clear for them that it was so.</span> <span id="s150">But when -- until 1918, 1920, and then they moderated us so that they have quite let loose this law.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Why did they moderate?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Why?</span> <span id="s153">We don't know.</span> <span id="s154">Life became, all of the sudden, easier for the Jews.</span> <span id="s155">Q: Did you experience as a boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: -- anti-Jewish feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s159">Always when I went to school and the -- got beaten by the larger Romanian population.</span> <span id="s160">It was not very happy, but you use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Was your community mixed or was it primarily Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Oh, no, mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: You had friends who were not Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: They were friends which were not Jewish and which I appreciate very much because they like to play soccer with me, because I was a very good goalkeeper.</span> <span id="s165">And therefore, I became their equal.</span> <span id="s166">They even didn't know.</span> <span id="s167">The younger boys didn't know what to do with anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s168">They were told, "Hate the Jews."</span> <span id="s169">So they thought, "Yes, I hate the Jews."</span> <span id="s170">But that was all that they did.</span> <span id="s171">But there were no beating up Jews, boys to boys, because we were on the same team, the football team.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: So, who were the kids that -- that made anti-Jewish comments to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Anti-Jewish comments were very few.</span> <span id="s174">There were the Romanian that choose to shit in your hat and tell the mother this is good.</span> <span id="s175">They made a rhyme and had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: But didn't you say that other kids would -- would beat you and --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Oh, no, that was after 1920.</span> <span id="s178">Yes, after 1920 they were running after us because they were told that they could beat us up and nothing would happen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: So is there anything else that you can think of that really changed when Romania took over, for you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s181">It was very clear it had to do with our so-called profession; watchmaker.</span> <span id="s182">One bought the watch and said, "I don't know what to do, my watch goes and all of the sudden doesn't go.</span> <span id="s183">Then I shake it, it goes.</span> <span id="s184">Then I don't shake it, it doesn't go.</span> <span id="s185">So I have to shake it all the time and I cannot go shaking my watch all over the time.</span> <span id="s186">So therefore, it's a dirty Jew sold me this watch and he knew it wasn't good."</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Were there any other laws that pertained?</span> <span id="s188">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s190">So you went to -- you went to a high school?</span> <span id="s191">You went to a public school?</span> <span id="s192">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: And what were you studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: What was I studying?</span> <span id="s195">The regular normal disciplines which every child studies.</span> <span id="s196">There where even a little more strict for Jews.</span> <span id="s197">And interesting, the teachers were Jewish.</span> <span id="s198">Now, they got a -- how do you say -- a diploma for their teachers, and they were kept as very important people, those teachers, because they just kept like Romanian teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Were you finished -- when you finished the public school, then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: There was already high school.</span> <span id="s201">And I finished the high school and then I had to decide if I want to go -- high school was a gymnasium there and then we decided we want to go to the university.</span> <span id="s202">This was a little harder because, first of all, to be accepted in the university, you have to pass an exam, which is the Romanian exam.</span> <span id="s203">And here we have to know the Romanian history.</span> <span id="s204">This was very complicated because they did not have a history.</span> <span id="s205">The Romanians did not have, by themselves.</span> <span id="s206">And the commission which had to ask us these questions, they didn't know themselves what to do.</span> <span id="s207">And they were very strict, especially with the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s208">To answer what they want to hear, that they had a university just as good as a Romanian university.</span> <span id="s209">They didn't have.</span> <span id="s210">So we had to invent it and to speak of it, and we were quite intelligent boys and really the Jewish kids were flunked for this examination.</span> <span id="s211">So we were very happy.</span> <span id="s212">And now, we were open for the university.</span> <span id="s213">And this was the biggest problem for us because we were not accepted in the Romanian university.</span> <span id="s214">And most of the students, now over the age of 18, 19, they went into foreign countries to study there.</span> <span id="s215">And this was Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s216">The neighboring countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I went to Austria and I studied music.</span> <span id="s219">And I got it right away.</span> <span id="s220">And I was accepted right away because I was a good violin player.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Where did you learn to play violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: This I learned in Chernivtsi.</span> <span id="s223">And there was an old man who played at weddings and birthdays, I don't know whatever he played.</span> <span id="s224">And he played pretty nice and I admired him and I wanted to be like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: So you studied throughout school?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: All of the time.</span> <span id="s227">Because the school system there is from 8 to 12.</span> <span id="s228">And 8 to 12 you learn the violin.</span> <span id="s229">After 12 you go home and you have the lesson.</span> <span id="s230">And -- and this was very pleasant because it's only four hours.</span> <span id="s231">So it was all right.</span> <span id="s232">Sure you learned other disciplines like arithmetic and what you have to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: You were taking the violin in addition to your -- A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So age 12 wasn't every day?</span> <span id="s235">A: Every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Regular school every day?</span> <span id="s237">A: Regular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Then, when did you do the violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: The violin, I did it all the time from 12 to 12 midnight.</span> <span id="s240">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Now, then you were studying in the theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s244">Then I went to the conservatory at the Vienna Music Academy.</span> <span id="s245">And they accepted me right away there and this was very nice for me.</span> <span id="s246">I was accepted there and I was somehow interested to go to a chamber music class at the second school.</span> <span id="s247">And then they accepted me, too.</span> <span id="s248">So I had two conservatories, it was called, and I studied there.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Now, at this point in time, were you aware of a build up of anti-Semitism or anything?</span> <span id="s250">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Can you talk about that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: This time we saw some students, colleague of mine, coming to school which a .</span> <span id="s253">They wore it, and looked down upon us.</span> <span id="s254">And some had songs when we marched into the class they started to sing this song.</span> <span id="s255">It's an anti-Jewish song and they had the whole -- it was a young man who was a drunkard.</span> <span id="s256">And they accepted this drunkard in their company very much.</span> <span id="s257">But one day he was killed.</span> <span id="s258">And sure, they said the Jewish killed him.</span> <span id="s259">He was just a drunkard.</span> <span id="s260">But then they created a song and it had terrible words to it.</span> <span id="s261">"When the Jewish blood drips from our knife, then we are just happy."</span> <span id="s262">So, what can we do?</span> <span id="s263">We knew this was .</span> <span id="s264">This is a name.</span> <span id="s265">And then everybody was singing the song, marched to the song, and it was a terrible song, a terrible idea of putting in this misery of, that a young man died the death of a hero.</span> <span id="s266">He was neither hero or zero.</span> <span id="s267">My goodness, but nothing -- but never mind.</span> <span id="s268">And he had this song .</span> <span id="s269">This song became more and more popular.</span> <span id="s270">They sang it all the occasions they had.</span> <span id="s271">And here this song was very -- I mean, very loved.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: This is in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: In Vienna -- in Vienna and then Chernivtsi and then anyplace where Jews were.</span> <span id="s274">Q: Were you all aware of what was happening in Germany, the rise of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Oh, sure, we were aware.</span> <span id="s276">But by that time, the laws were so strict that you couldn't go from Germany to Romania to German.</span> <span id="s277">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s278">So therefore, you know, hey, Germany is far, what should we be afraid of?</span> <span id="s279">So we were not afraid of.</span> <span id="s280">So students who left Chernivtsi for Germany to study there, they tried to get out and they got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did you sense a relationship between what was going on in -- in Vienna and Chernivtsi with what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s283">We saw clearly that the group here makes this misery and arranged it that it should be absolutely synchronized with the Germans.</span> <span id="s284">And we had -- in Yatsi (ph.), this is a town in Romania, a university town -- and in this university town, there was a teacher by the name of Yon Cuza, C-U-Z-A.</span> <span id="s285">And this Yon Cuza had power over life and death because he was deretian (ph.) of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s286">And Hitler came to Yatsi to study with Yon Cuza.</span> <span id="s287">So he knew they had it -- they had it made.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What time -- are we now in the late 20s or -- A: No, middle 20s.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Middle 20s.</span> <span id="s290">Were there new laws that prevented Jews from participating in university or in the economy or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s292">They introduced a new .</span> <span id="s293">That means, this is according to the enrollment of students, the Jews had to be counted.</span> <span id="s294">How many Jews compared to how many gentiles.</span> <span id="s295">And we didn't know, but we heard that -- that this 2,500.</span> <span id="s296">So this was very tragic because all of the sudden, all of the Jewish students are aware that the group of Jews had to leave the university.</span> <span id="s297">So this was very sad but they didn't do anything again.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: I think we have to stop a minute.</span> <span id="s299">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: You were talking about quotas at the universities.</span> <span id="s302">In what other ways were Jewish people restricted in Romania at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: In Romania, it was enough to have quotas because they shrunk and shrunk all of the time and it was really hard that the Jew could go into the Romanian university.</span> <span id="s304">So almost all went to German universities, Austin and Hungarian, whatever there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Were Jews restricted from some certain professions?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Oh, yes, doctors.</span> <span id="s307">They couldn't become a doctor, couldn't study in the doctor's faculty.</span> <span id="s308">And they couldn't study in the engineer faculty.</span> <span id="s309">And they couldn't study in the faculty of -- of science.</span> <span id="s310">So there were cut, cut, cut down and they final result is it's no use to go to this university.</span> <span id="s311">And then we went to Italy.</span> <span id="s312">I had a friend who went to Italian university.</span> <span id="s313">His name is Arnold (ph.) Rim,</span></p> <p><span id="s314">R-I-M.</span> <span id="s315">And he was using the Italian university and he was in voice -- he had a wonderful voice -- in the music faculty.</span> <span id="s316">In Italy it was very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What did the doctors and the engineers who were already practicing their careers?</span> <span id="s318">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Were they restricted at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s321">They could practice only on certain days and couldn't take gentile patients.</span> <span id="s322">So it was forbidden to -- really to be a doctor like you are in America or anybody so --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: What about businesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Businesses it was even worse.</span> <span id="s325">They were told you can only be so much and much in this and this business.</span> <span id="s326">Yeah, I think somebody counted their money, of which they have a good part to give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So your mother was a teacher?</span> <span id="s328">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did she continue teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: No.</span> <span id="s331">Then she was permitted to be a teacher of religion.</span> <span id="s332">So -- Q: So you went on being a musician?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Was that easy?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Very easy.</span> <span id="s336">We didn't feel anything.</span> <span id="s337">We didn't have any restriction and we played as much as we</span></p> <p><span id="s338">could.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: And you played with non-Jews as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s341">You couldn't have an -- an orchestra which consisted only of Jews.</span> <span id="s342">This is -- the late pianist.</span> <span id="s343">Now, there are many Jewish orchestras but this was not in the height of the Hitler time.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Did everyone get along?</span> <span id="s345">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Did everyone get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: If you don't get along, you don't have an orchestra.</span> <span id="s348">So if you get along.</span> <span id="s349">Orchestras build basis on discipline, Jewish or non-Jewish and the feeling of the piece you just played.</span> <span id="s350">And if you don't have this, then you have nothing.</span> <span id="s351">And the audience demanded that this should be fulfilled any time you performed.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Who were you playing with at the time; what orchestra were you with?</span> <span id="s353">Were you teaching; were you playing?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I was teaching and I was playing.</span> <span id="s355">But mainly the playing was done.</span> <span id="s356">In Vienna, we have an orchestra which is called .</span> <span id="s357">At our next intermission I will tell you we have to go up in my room.</span> <span id="s358">I still have one thing that I put on the wall and .</span> <span id="s359">Hey, I think now there were more gentiles than Jews.</span> <span id="s360">But there were gentiles because the gentiles are not string players.</span> <span id="s361">The violin, the viola, chello, bass, this is the Jews.</span> <span id="s362">But then the trumpet and the French horn and this is the gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">However, I don't why, but in every orchestra -- in the Philadelphia orchestra today has.</span> <span id="s364">So you don't have it because they have.</span> <span id="s365">This is customary.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What's -- didn't you have an experience where one of your colleagues were taking down names and reporting them to the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Is that another --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No, he didn't take down names.</span> <span id="s370">Hitler was all over all a buff.</span> <span id="s371">Everything.</span> <span id="s372">When Hitler gave a speech the town was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: In what country now; in Austria or Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: In Romania, in Austria, in Germany, in Hungary, and any other countries.</span> <span id="s375">Everybody Hitler talks, let's hear what he has to say.</span> <span id="s376">What he had to say or what he did say was so stupid for one who speaks German, who speaks real Germany.</span> <span id="s377">It didn't sound like German.</span> <span id="s378">It sound like barking of a dog.</span> <span id="s379">And the louder he could bark, the more respect people had and the more admired him.</span> <span id="s380">I cannot get over how the people today, when they hear a recording of Hitler, they shut up and stand stiff and listen to it.</span> <span id="s381">And he is very great.</span> <span id="s382">Today.</span> <span id="s383">Therefore, I don't know how this is possible that the stupidity carries on, even over centuries.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Did you ever hear him speak?</span> <span id="s385">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Tell me about that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: This experience starts, .</span> <span id="s388">"My German brothers, I'm here only to help you to be alive.</span> <span id="s389">Because this misery of those infiltrated sickness, which I mean the Jewish sickness, this we cannot take very long.</span> <span id="s390">Because if you don't fight it, then it is our end.</span> <span id="s391">So we have to stand up and fight against them."</span> <span id="s392">And the people yell, "Bravo, hooray."</span> <span id="s393">And so what did he say?</span> <span id="s394">Nothing.</span> <span id="s395">Yeah, but see we don't agree or we don't realize that this is nothing.</span> <span id="s396">For us this is the biggest and the loudest.</span> <span id="s397">And then all of the sudden he cries.</span> <span id="s398">I saw my dear mother going to the food market and she wanted to buy a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s399">And they say, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s400">We don't have any more bread.</span> <span id="s401">And this poor woman stood there and we didn't have anymore bread.</span> <span id="s402">And I thought it's very sad to realize how the people had to take it without any -- how do you call it -- they didn't have any anything putting against it, which is so easy and very bad.</span> <span id="s403">They heard all these things and Hitler speaks again.</span> <span id="s404">So all of the sudden, they tell us that he's attacked by Poland.</span> <span id="s405">"Oh, they attacked."</span> <span id="s406">And all of the sudden you can see soldiers in German uniform lying dead.</span> <span id="s407">And people who look closer saw the image of the concentration camp, Jews dressed in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: When is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: I'm getting confused.</span> <span id="s411">Where are we now?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: We are in Gleiwitz, where they started the war.</span> <span id="s413">And they said, "German soldiers were killed by Polish soldiers and look what happened."</span> <span id="s414">And there was not true, not a word.</span> <span id="s415">So here the war started.</span> <span id="s416">But it is very interesting that we here in America don't talk very much about this, possibly not.</span> <span id="s417">Because this is not a story I tell you, this is printed in the papers and you can read it.</span> <span id="s418">But then the other thing, which was really tragic, here comes Hitler to Stalin and said, "Stalin, we have to be friends."</span> <span id="s419">And Stalin said, "Why?</span> <span id="s420">I'm the biggest fascist and you're the biggest communist.</span> <span id="s421">How can we be friends?"</span> <span id="s422">"Look, I have to start the war against Poland and if you don't help me as a good friend, then the whole thing is for not."</span> <span id="s423">So they became good friends and Stalin helped Hitler two full years.</span> <span id="s424">Send him armorment, send him food.</span> <span id="s425">And so Hitler could take all the countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia -- which he took before, but never mind.</span> <span id="s426">In the war he took them now.</span> <span id="s427">And then he could take France and Belgium and all these countries.</span> <span id="s428">And Stalin send him armorment and food and so on because the agreement was signed on the 23rd of August 1939.</span> <span id="s429">And the 1st of September 1939, the war started.</span> <span id="s430">Who started the war?</span> <span id="s431">Stalin started the war.</span> <span id="s432">People here said Hitler started the war.</span> <span id="s433">This is stupidity because they don't want to read in the library, the agreement between Stalin and Hitler.</span> <span id="s434">Exactly eight days after they signed the contract.</span> <span id="s435">a bargain between the two foreign ministers.</span> <span id="s436">Eight days afterwards, the war started.</span> <span id="s437">So now who started the war?</span> <span id="s438">Stalin because he said, "Okay, yeah, my friend.</span> <span id="s439">Now we have to be friendly."</span> <span id="s440">And the railroad line that we went on the Russia now, going through was Chernivtsi was blocked.</span> <span id="s441">It couldn't be used anymore because it was only for armorment for Germany.</span> <span id="s442">No passenger, no freight trains, nothing went, only this for armorment for Russia -- for Germany -- Russia send it to Germany.</span> <span id="s443">Now what -- why are we today still afraid?</span> <span id="s444">But it's not a story I tell you.</span> <span id="s445">It's a story you can read in the library.</span> <span id="s446">And so therefore, I hope that people will get their mind straight and see the broader history is here.</span> <span id="s447">Otherwise, they are afraid to do anything and this is false.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Let's talk a little bit about Chernivtsi.</span> <span id="s449">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What the city was it like, what was happening about that time in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: In 1938, Chernivtsi had the biggest, greatest German alters.</span> <span id="s452">They were all Jews.</span> <span id="s453">And the alters were and then -- I forget seven or more -- and they are painted in Germany and in German.</span> <span id="s454">And he's the greatest German author.</span> <span id="s455">He's a Jew from Chernivtsi.</span> <span id="s456">So the life of an intellectual life, you cannot suppress.</span> <span id="s457">It went on all the time.</span> <span id="s458">The was just like Vienna.</span> <span id="s459">The trumpets were on all of the time.</span> <span id="s460">I played very often there.</span> <span id="s461">And we were very happy there we could do this.</span> <span id="s462">What would happen to this -- also it was on the Russia.</span> <span id="s463">But here in a short time, the Russia suppressed the German activity.</span> <span id="s464">I mean, the Germans literary activity and it sank down a little.</span> <span id="s465">But they say if you want to hear on the handgushes (ph.), it means the hand street, you call a doctor and the whole street turns around, because everybody has a Ph. D. that agrees there.</span> <span id="s466">And then all turn around.</span> <span id="s467">So this is Chernivtsi on the highest intellectual level.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Now, Chernivtsi was in Romania until 1940?</span> <span id="s469">A: No -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: It was part Romania?</span> <span id="s471">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: But all of its cultural activities thrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah, it went on and on but not very strong.</span> <span id="s474">But then all of the sudden the Dean at the University comes in and says, "Ladies and gentlemen, we are now awaiting our leader.</span> <span id="s475">We are liberated."</span> <span id="s476">And I thought, by the way, one more liberation and I wouldn't survive.</span> <span id="s477">And now we are liberated by Joseph Stalin (ph.).</span> <span id="s478">And he is the greatest humane person.</span> <span id="s479">And we have to realize because we are now really liberated.</span> <span id="s480">So we were liberated from our possessions, taken to Siberia and so -- now, this Russia has a funny habit.</span> <span id="s481">They have great alters.</span> <span id="s482">And if you can show me a book, which was printed before the colonies were there, and this book should not mention at least once the word "Siberia," I put down any price you want.</span> <span id="s483">Because Siberia is part of the pulsation of Russia.</span> <span id="s484">And what is Siberia?</span> <span id="s485">A lady said here, "I know Siberia is cold.</span> <span id="s486">But what else do they have?"</span> <span id="s487">No idea, a bunk (ph.).</span> <span id="s488">And Siberia is a very important basis of life in Russia.</span> <span id="s489">And so this Siberia goes on, even day and any day.</span> <span id="s490">So what can we say?</span> <span id="s491">This is very tragic.</span> <span id="s492">And it's very tragic for 72 years, people believed the biggest bunk was their thought.</span> <span id="s493">And this is Siberia.</span> <span id="s494">And that you cannot hear what happens in a foreign country, there is a lot closed-up, that when they moved into Chernivtsi, the first question was, "Do you have relatives in a foreign country?"</span> <span id="s495">God forbid, say no.</span> <span id="s496">Because if you say yes, then you're a passenger for Siberia.</span> <span id="s497">And just what they did.</span> <span id="s498">So all of the sudden, my mother-in-law, a lady who never could miss opening of opera in Vienna or an exhibition in Paris, didn't have any idea of politic.</span> <span id="s499">What is politician?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Didn't even know that we are in Romania, that we are in Russia.</span> <span id="s501">And she is taken for 17 years to Siberia.</span> <span id="s502">Why?</span> <span id="s503">Because her husband was taken before, some half a year.</span> <span id="s504">And she was deported with her mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s505">Her mother-in-law died in the transport.</span> <span id="s506">But she was not the only one.</span> <span id="s507">There were 39,000 people say.</span> <span id="s508">And these were not Jews.</span> <span id="s509">These were mostly Jews, but they are not.</span> <span id="s510">So therefore, we should be clear that all this is very clear in the mind of the life.</span> <span id="s511">And they're used to such a life.</span> <span id="s512">To put people in wagons, kettle cars, and take.</span> <span id="s513">And you don't know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: What other changes happened when the Soviets occupied Chernivtsi?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Oh, the changes which happened there, they were not visible because the people were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s517">There were all nationalities.</span> <span id="s518">But this was very sad that all of the sudden it became so people were taken away at night.</span> <span id="s519">You never saw them.</span> <span id="s520">When I came here, some people asked me, "What's the difference between the Germans and the Russians?"</span> <span id="s521">I said, "The Germans arrest during the morning and the Russians during the late night, late evening."</span> <span id="s522">And this was the whole difference.</span> <span id="s523">You never know why, what.</span> <span id="s524">And it was wonderful organized.</span> <span id="s525">In Russia, when you take a person, arrest him, and you lead him, you also go with a loaded gun behind the person.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">This is only in Russia.</span> <span id="s527">In Germany, there are -- I don't know -- the man -- how do you say this?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s530">So therefore, I never saw thought that somebody should go with a loaded gun or in the street and very fast, one to one and go.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Were the Russians tougher on the Jews than the Romanians have been -- or the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No.</span> <span id="s533">The Romanians were not tough on Jews.</span> <span id="s534">I cannot say it.</span> <span id="s535">Not just because they are Jewish, but the Russians?</span> <span id="s536">Oh, yeah, .</span> <span id="s537">That means "dirty Jews."</span> <span id="s538">.</span> <span id="s539">No.</span> <span id="s540">But they deported a whole village.</span> <span id="s541">And so those peasants from the village, they were very smart.</span> <span id="s542">They took cats in sacks and moved there with the cats.</span> <span id="s543">And when the Russians come through the woods to chase them, they let the cats run and the cats climb the trees and the dog barked after cats.</span> <span id="s544">So here we are quiet all of the sudden and our village went through because Russia was colorless and the Romania was a beautiful country with beautiful country with people.</span> <span id="s545">And they are the fields you see when you fly, small fields, all color and so on.</span> <span id="s546">But they were very proud to have this.</span> <span id="s547">It was -- it was a nice thing.</span> <span id="s548">That, "This is my field.</span> <span id="s549">I do whatever I want.</span> <span id="s550">I plant whatever I want, but I plant and I love it."</span> <span id="s551">So what comes out here is instead is the misery that everyone buys his own field and is himself a big landowner.</span> <span id="s552">It's a little landowner but never mind.</span> <span id="s553">And therefore, he thinks to himself, he's a big planter.</span> <span id="s554">"It's my land."</span> <span id="s555">And I -- every summer I took my -- what are they -- hiking shoes, and I went to the mountains, always.</span> <span id="s556">We stayed there a hay loft of a peasant.</span> <span id="s557">They let us stay there.</span> <span id="s558">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s559">And they for dinner, all ate together and it was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Now, so you're still at the conservatory and playing?</span> <span id="s561">A: That's right, in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: No, No.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Aren't you in Chernivtsi now?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s566">I went back to Chernivtsi when Hitler got near.</span> <span id="s567">"I think Hitler is too close.</span> <span id="s568">Let's go back to Germany."</span> <span id="s569">So I was living in conservatory and I had my string quartet.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: You had a string quartet?</span> <span id="s571">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: In Chernivtsi?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Actually, I want to go back a minute and just ask you about your family and were you married at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: No.</span> <span id="s578">I told you how I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: I know but you didn't tell the camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: You see, when the Russians came in there was no newspaper and no radio.</span> <span id="s581">I mean we had radio that played marches and the newspaper wrote how peasant so and so is very happy because he sees butter for the first time in his life.</span> <span id="s582">It's not true, he saw butter all the years.</span> <span id="s583">But never mind.</span> <span id="s584">This was life in Russia.</span> <span id="s585">And -- but I was arranging the orchestra there and I looked out the window and I saw kids running in the doorway and hiding.</span> <span id="s586">And then they came out, stood around the conservatory.</span> <span id="s587">I went down and asked those kids, "Why are you around the conservatory?</span> <span id="s588">What are you hiding for?"</span> <span id="s589">"Oh, mother said I should run because they took my father away.</span> <span id="s590">You see, mother said I should jump out the window and run to the town.</span> <span id="s591">So I jumped out the window and run to the town.</span> <span id="s592">And here we are afraid of the police, of the maligia (ph.)."</span> <span id="s593">"Oh, I see."</span> <span id="s594">So I couldn't understand what the hell is carrying those kids on.</span> <span id="s595">Now, all of the sudden, here I see one day at 12 noon, I lock the door I want to go eat lunch.</span> <span id="s596">Here stands such a kid, and stands at the door and says, "Hi, I came to have a job."</span> <span id="s597">"What job?</span> <span id="s598">Your a kid?</span> <span id="s599">What do you want?"</span> <span id="s600">"No, no.</span> <span id="s601">I graduated the conservatory."</span> <span id="s602">Shows me a paper.</span> <span id="s603">Yes, he graduated.</span> <span id="s604">He must be a genius.</span> <span id="s605">"Look, I lock the door, you will have no job now because now you need lunch."</span> <span id="s606">He said, "Lunch, yes, but I want a job, please, enroll me."</span> <span id="s607">So he treads after me and steps down and we walk the streets.</span> <span id="s608">And he says, "How much money do you have?"</span> <span id="s609">I said, "Three ruble" -- about 75 cents.</span> <span id="s610">He said, "Three ruble, do you know that's enough to get married?"</span> <span id="s611">I said, "You're crazy."</span> <span id="s612">"Yes, I agree, I'm crazy but I see you have no place to sleep, nothing to eat, so it would be best up should get married."</span> <span id="s613">"I don't want to get married."</span> <span id="s614">I have it in front of the house that people get married.</span> <span id="s615">They call it in Russia.</span> <span id="s616">So I drag it up three flights and we walk in and it's a woman, a young woman.</span> <span id="s617">She asks, "Want to get married?"</span> <span id="s618">"Yes."</span> <span id="s619">"To a girl?"</span> <span id="s620">"Yes."</span> <span id="s621">"You live with her?"</span> <span id="s622">"No."</span> <span id="s623">"Sleep with her?"</span> <span id="s624">"No."</span> <span id="s625">"Have children with her?"</span> <span id="s626">"No."</span> <span id="s627">"Okay.</span> <span id="s628">Hurry up, want to get married?"</span> <span id="s629">"This man, do you live with him?"</span> <span id="s630">Oh, she starts to cry.</span> <span id="s631">What an insult, she lives with a man?</span> <span id="s632">She never had to date in that life.</span> <span id="s633">She's all of 16 years old.</span> <span id="s634">And then here starts the problem to have children with him, she cries already loud she cries.</span> <span id="s635">Okay, this woman calls out, "Hey you, sign here."</span> <span id="s636">I sign.</span> <span id="s637">"This girl signs."</span> <span id="s638">She signs.</span> <span id="s639">"Where's your rubles," she says, "Hey you, put down your three rubles.</span> <span id="s640">Put down the three rubles."</span> <span id="s641">And now we are married.</span> <span id="s642">And we walked down the steps.</span> <span id="s643">Come downstairs, I have this paper in my hands and say, " ?</span> <span id="s644">What is your name in the polite German form.</span> <span id="s645">"My name is Gertrude."</span> <span id="s646">"Okay, now be quiet."</span> <span id="s647">So therefore, all of the sudden, she got married.</span> <span id="s648">And now this is the way we got married and we are still married.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Now, you've just told me the story of your wedding.</span> <span id="s652">I must say it seems rather reckless.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Reckless.</span> <span id="s654">I'm very lucky because at that time I didn't know what "reckless" means.</span> <span id="s655">So -- but I commanded her around as much as I could.</span> <span id="s656">She had the big respect for me, the big man.</span> <span id="s657">We were known all over and she talks so intimate.</span> <span id="s658">But I figured why did we get married?</span> <span id="s659">She wanted to get another name because she new very well if one family member somehow held back by the police, the whole family goes to hell.</span> <span id="s660">So she needed another name and here she has another name.</span> <span id="s661">Okay, .</span> <span id="s662">And now comes what should come; a mother, a sister.</span> <span id="s663">But I told her in Russia there was the law, nine people to one room.</span> <span id="s664">We had three rooms, so 27 have to live here.</span> <span id="s665">But it doesn't mean nine people a room.</span> <span id="s666">They can push in here, push there.</span> <span id="s667">And therefore, a couple came.</span> <span id="s668">They were teachers; a man and a wife.</span> <span id="s669">And she came with a big barrel in her hand.</span> <span id="s670">Carried it and put it down on a Persian rug.</span> <span id="s671">I said, "No, don't, don't, don't.</span> <span id="s672">What you do?</span> <span id="s673">You're dripping water all over the place."</span> <span id="s674">"I know and that's the reason I put it here.</span> <span id="s675">It shouldn't ruin the floor."</span> <span id="s676">And it was very sad.</span> <span id="s677">But then --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: What made you --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: What made you --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: What made me?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: What made you marry a woman that you saw for the first time; love at first sight?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No.</span> <span id="s684">She looked like hell.</span> <span id="s685">She had two dresses on and one winter coat.</span> <span id="s686">No.</span> <span id="s687">It was just so I wanted -- I felt a little bad because I was happy all the time and she all of the time.</span> <span id="s688">"What is with you?"</span> <span id="s689">"Nothing, nothing, nothing."</span> <span id="s690">Didn't want to talk and didn't want to -- just cried all of the time.</span> <span id="s691">So we came home, rang the bell, mother opened the door, "Hi, my dears.</span> <span id="s692">Who is that?"</span> <span id="s693">-- no -- "What is that" -- not "who is that."</span> <span id="s694">Looked like hell.</span> <span id="s695">"Mother, we have another in our family."</span> <span id="s696">"You got married?"</span> <span id="s697">"Yes, mom."</span> <span id="s698">Now she catches on.</span> <span id="s699">"What would you like for a wedding present?"</span> <span id="s700">"Wedding present?</span> <span id="s701">A big pot full of stuffed cabbage."</span> <span id="s702">It's called .</span> <span id="s703">Mother started to -- to cook.</span> <span id="s704">You know how to make ?</span> <span id="s705">You take a leaf of kraut and put a little meat in and close it up.</span> <span id="s706">Leaf of a kraut, a little meat.</span> <span id="s707">.</span> <span id="s708">And mother started making right away because kraut, you have -- everybody have a kraut and meat is all so little.</span> <span id="s709">So and mother started to make and Gertrude started to tell, two days ago two soldiers came in or four Russia soldiers and said they had to look through here.</span> <span id="s710">"What do you have to look through?"</span> <span id="s711">No, get this mother on the couch.</span> <span id="s712">Her mother-in-law on the couch, gathered on the couch.</span> <span id="s713">And they have cried there, those three people together.</span> <span id="s714">And, yeah, and he next to his wife.</span> <span id="s715">And so it goes, here and they look all over and then, all of the sudden, one -- after two, three hours, reaches for his hankerchief, pulls it out, blows his nose, puts it in.</span> <span id="s716">"Let me look here.</span> <span id="s717">What is it?</span> <span id="s718">Oh, yeah, and then there was -- I think it then ruble -- no, ten dollars, American bill.</span> <span id="s719">"Hey, they have foreign money here.</span> <span id="s720">Hey, let's look."</span> <span id="s721">Couldn't find anything else.</span> <span id="s722">Yeah, brought it along.</span> <span id="s723">Yeah, it just goes to show how he pull it out of the pocket.</span> <span id="s724">So now he -- they have to taken him along.</span> <span id="s725">He has to sign.</span> <span id="s726">They said, "What do you have to sign here and I can't go with him."</span> <span id="s727">The mother says, "No, you cannot go.</span> <span id="s728">You wait here.</span> <span id="s729">He will be back in a short time."</span> <span id="s730">And that was the last time they saw him.</span> <span id="s731">Didn't see him anymore.</span> <span id="s732">And they don't know where he is, what he is, where was he at.</span> <span id="s733">But that she didn't tell me and didn't tell anybody because, you know, there is a law if somebody in your family is arrested, then the whole family shortly will be arrested too.</span> <span id="s734">So -- but this is not a soviet law.</span> <span id="s735">This is a Russian law.</span> <span id="s736">It goes endless, centuries ago.</span> <span id="s737">So, therefore, this was the old thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">And Gertrude cried.</span> <span id="s739">And now she lay down on the couch and turned to the wall and cried.</span> <span id="s740">So nice wedding present do I have.</span> <span id="s741">So we'll see what can we do with her.</span> <span id="s742">And then stuff -- she gathered the that her father was taken away.</span> <span id="s743">And her mother -- no, not yet was her mother.</span> <span id="s744">Her father was taken away.</span> <span id="s745">Now mother has done the stuffed cabbage and we started to eat and we ate.</span> <span id="s746">And my sister came.</span> <span id="s747">"Hello."</span> <span id="s748">Oh, my sister was dressed with the latest cry of fashion always.</span> <span id="s749">She was very beautiful and very nice.</span> <span id="s750">And looked at that.</span> <span id="s751">"What's that?"</span> <span id="s752">Okay, now we have to take her in -- our hands.</span> <span id="s753">She has to do something.</span> <span id="s754">And she took Gertrude in her hands and did nice things.</span> <span id="s755">Gertrude didn't like her very much because my sister was beautiful and very nice and very good, but always so full of her and she must look good, and must have these shoes and these clothes and so on, and cannot go get dressed like that and so this was it.</span> <span id="s756">And now we knew that we have to go sleep in the basement.</span> <span id="s757">And in the basement we heard crying of people all live next door or somewhere because the people were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: This was in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yeah, 1940, exactly.</span> <span id="s760">So people are deported.</span> <span id="s761">Taken out and down to the trucks, until the truck was full, then comes the next.</span> <span id="s762">So -- and it was really murder.</span> <span id="s763">It was tragic.</span> <span id="s764">On the truck you see people holding each other and crying, "Why us?</span> <span id="s765">What did we do?</span> <span id="s766">Why?"</span> <span id="s767">So -- and then the people talk to each other, then they say, "No, we never said -- we never.</span> <span id="s768">We were the happiest people in the town."</span> <span id="s769">They said, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s770">Because we knew they liked Jews and like everybody.</span> <span id="s771">.</span> <span id="s772">They were did what they were told.</span> <span id="s773">It was murder.</span> <span id="s774">And so therefore, you heard it all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">But it is clear that they didn't do anything, anything to make these people feel better or something.</span> <span id="s776">No nothing.</span> <span id="s777">And, therefore, this was the situation.</span> <span id="s778">And so when we came in the truck, my mother was so natural as I. My mother, "Okay.</span> <span id="s779">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s780">You will see your ."</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Do you think -- I don't mean to interrupt you -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: -- but was it the craziness of the times that made you so what would normally seem impetuous?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">So quick to make a decision about getting married or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s785">Coming to the wedding.</span> <span id="s786">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: No.</span> <span id="s788">The whole time was very crazy.</span> <span id="s789">It was -- we knew of people get married for a pound of coffee.</span> <span id="s790">People get married for a pair of shoes, a pair of soles, for fixing my shoes.</span> <span id="s791">And so people get married for getting married.</span> <span id="s792">No reason.</span> <span id="s793">So therefore, don't think for a minute there's a reason, if anybody can tell you why.</span> <span id="s794">Philosophically, can you talk around it as much as you want, but in reality, you cannot explain it.</span> <span id="s795">So therefore, it is has nothing to do.</span> <span id="s796">We just got married and now we sit here and wherever we go.</span> <span id="s797">And nobody sit down next to you.</span> <span id="s798">Everybody says, "No, no, where we go?</span> <span id="s799">What is this."</span> <span id="s800">And we did -- the most thing was that we were so mentally derooted here and there.</span> <span id="s801">"Where can they take us?</span> <span id="s802">We are in northern boarder.</span> <span id="s803">This is Russia."</span> <span id="s804">So they take us to Russia.</span> <span id="s805">"Okay, take us to Russia.</span> <span id="s806">What's wrong with Russia?"</span> <span id="s807">So guessing .</span> <span id="s808">Therefore the basic problem is you cannot explain and nobody can explain it for the same day.</span> <span id="s809">But married, many people got married.</span> <span id="s810">So there was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Tell me a little bit about what was happening in the town?</span> <span id="s812">You didn't go on the first deportation, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: The first was all the Jews should go in this street and this street and that street and that street.</span> <span id="s814">And this will be the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s815">And nobody, no Jew is permitted to be home.</span> <span id="s816">So how do you get some 30,000 Jews in five minutes here?</span> <span id="s817">Because if you were had -- -- if you would have anything, any belongings after five, they were taken away.</span> <span id="s818">So people stand there and cry and yell.</span> <span id="s819">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s820">You don't speak German.</span> <span id="s821">I got a wonderful book of a friend of mine who was in Siberia and wrote a book, The Art of Survive.</span> <span id="s822">Therefore, this is old.</span> <span id="s823">Now I knew a captain who was sitting on a horse and riding around there, I said, "Look, captain, what should I do?"</span> <span id="s824">And just once he takes a pencil and writes on paper, "Samuel Flor and his whole family will be deported with the last transport."</span> <span id="s825">Yeah, it's nice.</span> <span id="s826">I still have it here.</span> <span id="s827">However, he cannot help me and I think and I have to go there.</span> <span id="s828">And we went to a doorway and there were all the people were lying there on blankets and so -- but it was very bad.</span> <span id="s829">And we laid there and then, all of the sudden we heard, "Gerty, Gerty."</span> <span id="s830">And there was a girl by the name of -- I don't know, she will tell you.</span> <span id="s831">And this woman here was with Gerty in the same class in school.</span> <span id="s832">"Come up here."</span> <span id="s833">And so we went up to her.</span> <span id="s834">We don't know where to step because the floor rot.</span> <span id="s835">So we went up there.</span> <span id="s836">She lived in this house and -- she and her husband -- and there we were two or three days.</span> <span id="s837">In the meantime, they put boards around us so you couldn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s838">You were locked in.</span> <span id="s839">And I don't know what to say and how to say it because, all of the sudden, you were in jail.</span> <span id="s840">But like we were with the Romanians, they put us also 200, 300 in such a group.</span> <span id="s841">We were there eight days.</span> <span id="s842">We said, "Oh, it will be like the Romanians.</span> <span id="s843">They will send us back."</span> <span id="s844">It was not like it was with the Romanians.</span> <span id="s845">And then came those with the name from A to D should go down to the street and when the train will stop, you go to the train.</span> <span id="s846">The train stops and those have to get in.</span> <span id="s847">"Get in, get in, go fast."</span> <span id="s848">And so now they move.</span> <span id="s849">Where do they go?</span> <span id="s850">We don't know.</span> <span id="s851">So therefore, this is a transportation and the people are taken.</span> <span id="s852">Now what it plays in role, we walked into such a train.</span> <span id="s853">In our wagon, there were two dead people.</span> <span id="s854">Two men were lying there dead.</span> <span id="s855">We yelled, "We have to take them out."</span> <span id="s856">"Shut up."</span> <span id="s857">And now the train starts to move with the dead people.</span> <span id="s858">And the air is terrible.</span> <span id="s859">And so we have to -- there is such a little window which has a .</span> <span id="s860">You can look through but you cannot do anything through this little window.</span> <span id="s861">We arranged so that everybody can stand five minutes next to the window.</span> <span id="s862">So we switched five minutes.</span> <span id="s863">And my mother was a genius.</span> <span id="s864">She said, "It's all right.</span> <span id="s865">Don't worry."</span> <span id="s866">What went down on this train, too, a couple.</span> <span id="s867">He opens up a jar of -- what did they have there?</span> <span id="s868">Honey marmalade, I think, something.</span> <span id="s869">And he had this knife and she yells at him and so he takes the knife and put dirt on her coat -- it's a raincoat she wore.</span> <span id="s870">She said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s871">And he takes the marmalade, a piece in his hands and throws it at her.</span> <span id="s872">Why you fight now?</span> <span id="s873">What are you fighting for?</span> <span id="s874">Who's right?</span> <span id="s875">Yeah.</span> <span id="s876">And so what should I tell you, this is -- these are tragic situations because I cannot tell these people you could be in five minutes dead, so when you're dead you cannot fight for the marmalade.</span> <span id="s877">What would it be then?</span> <span id="s878">So I hunt down with Gertrude and we sit in the water.</span> <span id="s879">And Gertrude doesn't cry anymore.</span> <span id="s880">Sits there and said, "Do you know where we go?"</span> <span id="s881">I said, "No, I don't know where we go and I don't want to know where we go.</span> <span id="s882">But do you know?"</span> <span id="s883">"I don't know."</span> <span id="s884">So after three days of traveling -- but what do we do?</span> <span id="s885">All of the sudden the train stops and from the train to the ground is about six feet.</span> <span id="s886">From the ground to -- because we are on the hill, is a -- I would say from the ground, it's a little , another six feet.</span> <span id="s887">And we went down and they yelled, "Move down here and do whatever you have to do."</span> <span id="s888">So in the bathroom everyday.</span> <span id="s889">So we did whatever we had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">And I always had fountain pen with me.</span> <span id="s891">Do I have it?</span> <span id="s892">Hey, hey, hey, she took it away.</span> <span id="s893">And a Romanian peasant boy, a soldier, looks at this grasps here, two pens and takes it away.</span> <span id="s894">An laughs and now he's happy, he knows he can't write.</span> <span id="s895">He cannot write but he has a pen, that's important.</span> <span id="s896">that means, not fountain pen -- it's pens that you have to put in ink and then you have to write.</span> <span id="s897">So do I look at them, so poor sole.</span> <span id="s898">He doesn't know how dumb he is.</span> <span id="s899">.</span> <span id="s900">So then we come, finally, to a river which is called Niesta (ph.).</span> <span id="s901">And this is Transnistria.</span> <span id="s902">And on this river, everybody should go on the ferry.</span> <span id="s903">But everybody has to pay 20 lay (ph.).</span> <span id="s904">I don't go on the ferry, I don't pay 20 lay.</span> <span id="s905">And then you get some -- what's a -- a whip over your head.</span> <span id="s906">And so then you pay 20 lay.</span> <span id="s907">Now you have to go to ferry with the whip, you pay.</span> <span id="s908">So, therefore, you cannot move and you're standing on the ferry.</span> <span id="s909">The ferry has a piece of wood standing here, and in back a piece of wood.</span> <span id="s910">And we are like the headings.</span> <span id="s911">You stand there and all of the sudden somebody opened it up and people fall in, in the water.</span> <span id="s912">Many couldn't swim, many could swim.</span> <span id="s913">So I don't know who couldn't swim an who could swim.</span> <span id="s914">And now we were .</span> <span id="s915">So my wife says, "No, I don't go on ferries.</span> <span id="s916">I don't want ferries."</span> <span id="s917">"You see what happens to those who don't want to?"</span> <span id="s918">So -- and then we went to the other shore, and there's another shore, you have to go on land.</span> <span id="s919">And then they said, "Who has relatives or friends who want to call from the town should yell your name and then we bring them over."</span> <span id="s920">Good.</span> <span id="s921">And we saw people, they looked like ghosts.</span> <span id="s922">They looked so terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">They were deported about a week ago.</span> <span id="s924">What a week did to those people, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Let me -- I want to ask you a question just for clarification.</span> <span id="s926">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: You were deported by whom?</span> <span id="s928">A: Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Romanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s931">Now, on the other sides of the ferry were Germans.</span> <span id="s932">Q: And in Transnistria --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: -- were the Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s936">On the other side of the ferry was Transnistria, and those were Germans.</span> <span id="s937">And therefore, the ferry moved and now they stopped and they are all on the other side, and the .</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Anybody can call if you want relatives and those people looked like ghosts.</span> <span id="s939">Terrible, it was terrible to touch them.</span> <span id="s940">And this was the beginning of the movement into Transnistria.</span> <span id="s941">Do you know what Transnistria means?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: It is has to do with the river, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: No.</span> <span id="s944">"Trans" means across.</span> <span id="s945">"Nistria," the river is called Nistia, it's Nistria.</span> <span id="s946">So like Transylvania, it means on the other side of the woods, "sylvania" is the woods.</span> <span id="s947">So therefore, those people come and then we look at them and lie and we don't know what to say.</span> <span id="s948">What should we say?</span> <span id="s949">And we see -- I mean those ghosts, coming and looking at us.</span> <span id="s950">We looked at them like "God, knows who ."</span> <span id="s951">And they looked terrible.</span> <span id="s952">They gave away their coat, their shoes for food, yeah.</span> <span id="s953">And therefore</span></p> <p><span id="s954">--</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Was everybody out in the open?</span> <span id="s956">Were they concentrated in certain areas?</span> <span id="s957">A: No, out in the open.</span> <span id="s958">Out in the open, which is a road.</span> <span id="s959">The street, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Was there a town nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: The town -- .</span> <span id="s962">There was a town which 50 years, yeah.</span> <span id="s963">And this was the town.</span> <span id="s964">We were forbidden to go into the town because the town looked even more than we dreamt.</span> <span id="s965">Gerty --</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: So you got over to .</span> <span id="s967">Then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: And then we were all whipped together with a whip and now we have to march.</span> <span id="s969">And we march and march and march.</span> <span id="s970">And people who couldn't move should not be helped by anybody.</span> <span id="s971">If you helped, you get the whip.</span> <span id="s972">So you got the whip, they fall down, you fall down, and then you go and you let them lie there.</span> <span id="s973">Never mind.</span> <span id="s974">So when we start to march after, six, seven or eight, it's already dark.</span> <span id="s975">And when we march, all of the sudden, I see we march in a circle.</span> <span id="s976">We march the same place around.</span> <span id="s977">So what for is this exercise?</span> <span id="s978">And then after a while we see those people who we left lying there, couldn't move, with open moves and their teeth were broken out because they had gold teeth.</span> <span id="s979">It was not nice to see.</span> <span id="s980">They were lying there.</span> <span id="s981">Some , I take over.</span> <span id="s982">So -- and this the same and then we march, march, and march, and came to a town which had a stone quarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">And we were all gathered to the stone quarry yard, and then we tried to lie down.</span> <span id="s984">And where should we lie down .</span> <span id="s985">In the stone quarry there's no grass.</span> <span id="s986">There's little grass, but it was not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s987">And we looked around and the people were lying around, and there was .</span> <span id="s988">and wrote his books.</span> <span id="s989">There he had been .</span> <span id="s990">Yes, and we saw it and we looked around.</span> <span id="s991">What was there to see?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Nothing.</span> <span id="s993">It was row of houses but not a row, a house, nothing, a house, and a house.</span> <span id="s994">And there were people living.</span> <span id="s995">And they wanted to take us in but we didn't not want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Were you on your own now, or were you part of an entourage?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Mother and sister and Gertrude and an entourage.</span> <span id="s998">I had all the Jews from our neighborhood, yeah.</span> <span id="s999">And so we marched until we came to the stone quarry and we lied down and sleep there.</span> <span id="s1000">Now we said, "Let's see what's here."</span> <span id="s1001">"Everybody should stand in a row."</span> <span id="s1002">What for we should stand in a row?</span> <span id="s1003">It was already dark.</span> <span id="s1004">I don't know, but we stood in the row.</span> <span id="s1005">"Okay, go up there and sleep whatever you can.</span> <span id="s1006">It's not bad, there's grass around."</span> <span id="s1007">So we lie there and then, but we have to eat something.</span> <span id="s1008">You had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1009">Nobody gives you something, nobody asks you for something.</span> <span id="s1010">And this river , it is called a "bug," B-U-G.</span> <span id="s1011">So I looked around and we lie down then it's dark and we can't sleep, everyone.</span> <span id="s1012">So we slept there and then the warm sun warmed us up and so we woke.</span> <span id="s1013">So they came with many buckets.</span> <span id="s1014">Everybody got a bucket.</span> <span id="s1015">Half of the family can take a bucket.</span> <span id="s1016">Go down, bring the bucket up filled with water.</span> <span id="s1017">What should we use this for?</span> <span id="s1018">Drinking, washing, cooking.</span> <span id="s1019">But you didn't know what the hell you were using.</span> <span id="s1020">We were told, "Wash yourselves and then leave the water for cooking."</span> <span id="s1021">And is much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1023">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Prior to -- prior to the time when you were transported -- this was not the first transport out?</span> <span id="s1027">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: How were people selected?</span> <span id="s1029">Who was transported first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: They had lists, and those lists are going on the whole time.</span> <span id="s1031">Collecting the list, who is this, who is that, who is that, what did he do.</span> <span id="s1032">I heard that I was transported when the Russians moved in, there came a man to me and said, "You take right away your music, write a song that you greet us as we come and take a poet.</span> <span id="s1033">He should write the text."</span> <span id="s1034">So I got Kitner (ph.), who was a very famous poet, and I got Sam Flor, and we wrote -- we were laying in the dark and the -- who are those people who -- who do this -- how you call them?</span> <span id="s1035">Who choke you -- they are the chokers -- the chokers helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Oppressors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: The oppressors, they have put us in.</span> <span id="s1038">And until the sun was beautiful, light came and made us free.</span> <span id="s1039">we are the free now and now we can say who's street is a street, who's world is a world we are beautiful poem, beautiful music.</span> <span id="s1040">And so I heard because of this, was Kitner and I deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: This is bothering you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1043">So this was the reason that we were deported, but everybody should have such a reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Do you remember who went first?</span> <span id="s1045">Wasn't there a transport where they hoarded up people from the hospitals and the asylums?</span> <span id="s1046">Was that in your transport or another transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: No, we don't know.</span> <span id="s1048">We cannot tell you when and how and what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Were you around -- were you around at the time of the first transport?</span> <span id="s1050">Do you remember what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Oh, yes, because everybody was transported from the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1052">And we had Mrs. Palvin Washstein (ph.), the piano teacher, say, "I want to go first because those who go last they don't find ."</span> <span id="s1053">What did she know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Wasn't there some sort of them marching you out of town and you were -- and you went by a ravine or something where there were a lot of bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Oh, yes, this was what I told you.</span> <span id="s1056">Q: So that was your transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: That wasn't an earlier one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: But every transport has the same things.</span> <span id="s1060">It's repeated.</span> <span id="s1061">It's all of the time.</span> <span id="s1062">Q: So how long were you at the stone quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Very short, about three, four days.</span> <span id="s1064">And then when took us to Tuccin (ph.).</span> <span id="s1065">Q: What was Tuccin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Tuccin was a town and the town had a square in the middle, and the square was very terrible dilapidated houses.</span> <span id="s1067">And they gave us these houses.</span> <span id="s1068">We should make them livable and we lived there.</span> <span id="s1069">Now this happened.</span> <span id="s1070">Now we have a place in these houses where a long house was together and it was not dilapidated too much, and there they wanted to make sort of a hotel, which means a place were where people work.</span> <span id="s1071">And this we tried to do to show how important we are, that we are useful.</span> <span id="s1072">We are useful.</span> <span id="s1073">So they can use us.</span> <span id="s1074">And so we made this hotel and then made a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s1075">So it was very nice.</span> <span id="s1076">And at last, after a few days only, but then came the major and the captain .</span> <span id="s1077">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1078">And the captain, "Yes, yes, this is nice and go work.</span> <span id="s1079">It's all right.</span> <span id="s1080">But I need two hundred people for the other side of the bug (ph.)."</span> <span id="s1081">Two hundred people, he needs two hundred people to shot.</span> <span id="s1082">"Oh, my what can we do?</span> <span id="s1083">How can we" -- only gold pieces help.</span> <span id="s1084">So we send out delegation to Romania to .</span> <span id="s1085">Maybe we can help get us home, send money.</span> <span id="s1086">And so also they did something so to get the people out and not to be sent across the bug because they were surely shot.</span> <span id="s1087">When we went on the -- that means on the stone quarry -- two people, two little people, I saw them very far.</span> <span id="s1088">They yelled, "Flor, Flor."</span> <span id="s1089">I yelled, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1090">They , so I should know their names, that they were sent across the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">This was a transport before us.</span> <span id="s1092">We were sent to Tuccin.</span> <span id="s1093">They were sent across the river.</span> <span id="s1094">And it's interesting that people say when they go across the river they will be shot, so I should use their names to remember their names.</span> <span id="s1095">People should remember they know them.</span> <span id="s1096">So I know this was their last song.</span> <span id="s1097">I don't know and I cannot tell you what their mind is, but what is in your mind you will know you will die very shortly.</span> <span id="s1098">You have something in your mind, everybody.</span> <span id="s1099">says, "Okay, I want that people should know that I was here.</span> <span id="s1100">I don't care what people.</span> <span id="s1101">Even if I tell it to you."</span> <span id="s1102">So therefore -- and then we started to march to Tuccin.</span> <span id="s1103">It was not far from Tuccin.</span> <span id="s1104">Not far means a four-hour march.</span> <span id="s1105">So we marched and then in Tuccin we had this hotel and we stood there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: What kind of work did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: I tried to do -- and I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1108">Because when the Russians marched in, and we had the river , and this river was shot to pieces.</span> <span id="s1109">I mean the bridge.</span> <span id="s1110">So we were called to do bridge work there.</span> <span id="s1111">It was very hard work.</span> <span id="s1112">And that -- I don't know what -- what to do with this bridge work, but finally, I did the following thing.</span> <span id="s1113">I had a friend who had tools for a carpenter.</span> <span id="s1114">"Okay, Sammy will be my assistant."</span> <span id="s1115">And we were the carpenters.</span> <span id="s1116">we were called, that means.</span> <span id="s1117">So as carpenters we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1119">But there's too much noise.</span> <span id="s1120">We need to shut the door.</span> <span id="s1121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1122">There's carpenters now.</span> <span id="s1123">We were called Here a lady yelled --</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1125">Would you please shut the door?</span> <span id="s1126">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1127">You were carpenters in Tuccin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1129">And I was called, with my friend who had the tools, from a lady, "Fix here the in the kitchen."</span> <span id="s1130">And you see this piece.</span> <span id="s1131">So he fixed it and she was very happy and she wanted to give us some money.</span> <span id="s1132">And then she looked at me and, oh, boy she was at my concerts, and she new very well I didn't know what to do and how to do it because I don't understand the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1133">So she gave me small coin.</span> <span id="s1134">So I took it.</span> <span id="s1135">"Thank you."</span> <span id="s1136">Now, therefore, it was my profession to be a carpenter and I was very happy that he took me.</span> <span id="s1137">And he, too -- he was -- was a lawyer and I was Flor.</span> <span id="s1138">So we were two carpenters.</span> <span id="s1139">And we also tried to have some useful work so they should see that they can use us.</span> <span id="s1140">But here, before we left Tuccin -- I mean the stone quarry, there came this commission and started to call names.</span> <span id="s1141">And they called the name "Professor Samuel Flor."</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: I need to stop you.</span> <span id="s1143">Now were you in the -- you were in the quarry for a few days, then you went to Tuccin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: The other way around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: This happened in the quarry.</span> <span id="s1147">Q: You went to the quarry first?</span> <span id="s1148">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: And then yelled the name "Samuel Flor" -- "Professor Samuel Flor."</span> <span id="s1151">I didn't move.</span> <span id="s1152">And the people looked at me, "Hey."</span> <span id="s1153">And so oh, again, called, "Professor Samuel Flor, step forward."</span> <span id="s1154">And I said, "Yes, I'm Samuel Flor, but I'm not the professor.</span> <span id="s1155">I am the doctor."</span> <span id="s1156">And I they thought I was saying Doctor Romano Flor, my uncle.</span> <span id="s1157">He is a surgeon.</span> <span id="s1158">"So you're a doctor.</span> <span id="s1159">Okay, go into this corner."</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Because I know they don't shoot doctors.</span> <span id="s1162">Therefore, I went close.</span> <span id="s1163">They said, "Okay, you are a doctor.</span> <span id="s1164">Go there in this corner next to Doctor Arot (ph.)."</span> <span id="s1165">Doctor Arot says, "Hello.</span> <span id="s1166">What should I say?</span> <span id="s1167">I will say I am Romano Flor."</span> <span id="s1168">He said, "Stop it.</span> <span id="s1169">You're crazy.</span> <span id="s1170">You cannot cut a person open."</span> <span id="s1171">"So now, what should I say?"</span> <span id="s1172">"Say you are a dentist.</span> <span id="s1173">I can help you."</span> <span id="s1174">So I was a dentist and they could help me but nothing happened afterwards because then we marched to Tuccin.</span> <span id="s1175">.</span> <span id="s1176">And I found out that the major wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1177">The Major who was the top.</span> <span id="s1178">So he was somewhere and then he came and said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1179">But in the meantime, I was there with Doctor Arot stood and said, "Say you are a dentist.</span> <span id="s1180">I will help you."</span> <span id="s1181">So I stood there and I figured out, okay, what happened?</span> <span id="s1182">So Doctor Arot took me under his wings, because he knew dentistry, like every surgeon knows.</span> <span id="s1183">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: So where did you practice your dentistry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: I said.</span> <span id="s1186">Now we have to go with the other people.</span> <span id="s1187">Other, we were 17 together and now we will be 15 and we followed them.</span> <span id="s1188">So I follow them and we came to Tuccin to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1189">The hospital was terribly dilapidated.</span> <span id="s1190">So I went there in this dilapidated hospital, and now the Doctor Arot explained that, "This is a drill.</span> <span id="s1191">You pump with your feet.</span> <span id="s1192">And this is a hand , you put with the hand, you drill, and this is the angle.</span> <span id="s1193">And you put in this little corner, the short drills."</span> <span id="s1194">And so -- and he explained to others, "There is huginal (ph.), colorphonal (ph.), and cardboard (ph.).</span> <span id="s1195">And this you need for the -- and this is armorgament (ph.).</span> <span id="s1196">You mix it with your -- here you mix it, you rub it, and it becomes soft, very soft.</span> <span id="s1197">And then if you leave it a while it becomes very hard.</span> <span id="s1198">Everybody knows armorgam (ph.), armorgam, armorgat (ph.), and you have it, too."</span> <span id="s1199">So -- and I believe that and I say, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1200">And then the Doctor explains that I have to press out the quick silver out of the armorgam press and press it to a piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s1201">So this was all right to do and so I started to make fillings with armorgam.</span> <span id="s1202">It was very nice to do this because I know that you close the cavity, which is black, then you clean it good.</span> <span id="s1203">After you clean it, you put a little huginal, and then with a little huginal on top, you put this armorgam, press it against the tooth, check if you have some trouble with the upper tooth.</span> <span id="s1204">So it was already so I loved it armorgam because it was very easy, no problem.</span> <span id="s1205">And it helped, no problem.</span> <span id="s1206">But then it became -- after a while, it became a little complicated.</span> <span id="s1207">The tooth pullings, I pulled very fast and there was no problem to pull the tooth because I know if you feel the little, least the goes with the prior, then you go to the other direction.</span> <span id="s1208">So you wiggle, you try to lift it off.</span> <span id="s1209">So it become very good.</span> <span id="s1210">He helped and I pulled and it was all right.</span> <span id="s1211">So it was no problem.</span> <span id="s1212">So therefore, I knew armorgam and I knew this other one, what I put in.</span> <span id="s1213">This is -- I clean the cavity, put a little huginal, then I put -- I mean what you -- in front of the teeth.</span> <span id="s1214">The Russians had terrible dentistry.</span> <span id="s1215">They would put you a green -- a green filling.</span> <span id="s1216">Why?</span> <span id="s1217">What the hell?</span> <span id="s1218">Why don't you put filling that look like that, like the tooth?</span> <span id="s1219">They say the green is better.</span> <span id="s1220">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1221">They still have the green.</span> <span id="s1222">So therefore -- and I was sometimes I had this.</span> <span id="s1223">But all of the sudden, they brought in a captain from the front.</span> <span id="s1224">We were on the front, it was very near.</span> <span id="s1225">And brought the captain from the front and he was wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Who the German or the Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: The German.</span> <span id="s1228">And he was -- I didn't see the Romanian Army very much, the fighting army.</span> <span id="s1229">No.</span> <span id="s1230">they came there and had things to do and they would have to yell very loudly for them to leave immediately and so on.</span> <span id="s1231">So it was -- and this captain died on the table.</span> <span id="s1232">So Doctor Arot was taken out and shot.</span> <span id="s1233">I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1234">I don't know, I was told he was shot.</span> <span id="s1235">And he was shot, okay.</span> <span id="s1236">And it was very sad because I stood here without a friend, without some -- instruments, I had, but what the hell to do with them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1237">So I looked very fast for a book.</span> <span id="s1238">I rode around in all the corners.</span> <span id="s1239">Finally, I found a book printed in 1880 and says don't use huginal.</span> <span id="s1240">Huginal is the first medication every doctor uses.</span> <span id="s1241">So I didn't use anymore huginal.</span> <span id="s1242">But then I gave it up and I used it.</span> <span id="s1243">So this was all right.</span> <span id="s1244">But I had this book printed in 1880 and I used to study it every night with Gert.</span> <span id="s1245">And we read the whole night.</span> <span id="s1246">Next morning, again, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1247">So it was -- the book helped a little still because it showed very clearly the forms.</span> <span id="s1248">Then after the book, here came a soldier with all the tooths standing like that.</span> <span id="s1249">The front tooth, one against the other, one against other, and so on.</span> <span id="s1250">And terrible smell that he had.</span> <span id="s1251">And so -- because I didn't know what to do in this moment, so I called the surgeon, a young boy 20, 22 years old.</span> <span id="s1252">He is a head surgeon.</span> <span id="s1253">I asked him, "Do you have a foot surgeon, too?"</span> <span id="s1254">Because I asked him now, "I have to pull all the front of the teeth."</span> <span id="s1255">He stands like that.</span> <span id="s1256">And then you have to saw them together.</span> <span id="s1257">Which means needles you have to give him.</span> <span id="s1258">What I am tried to I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1259">And then I will, after this heals, I will give him an upper -- how could you call this -- an upper plat -- plate.</span> <span id="s1260">Okay.</span> <span id="s1261">Very good.</span> <span id="s1262">So he pulled.</span> <span id="s1263">I dried it and then I dried it , clearly dry.</span> <span id="s1264">And then we sat like crazy and waited for what will happen tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1265">And we waited a whole night.</span> <span id="s1266">And then it was good.</span> <span id="s1267">It was all right.</span> <span id="s1268">It healed, he slept, healed again, okay.</span> <span id="s1269">Therefore, arubia (ph.) is all we gave him.</span> <span id="s1270">This sort of a sleeping , disinfecting thing.</span> <span id="s1271">So it was all right.</span> <span id="s1272">And then, next day, I took the technician and we made him a plate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: This is amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: So now you're in Tuccin -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: And you're treating German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1278">Two, three, Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1279">Also two, three woman came in.</span> <span id="s1280">But the captain left and so they got -- lost their paper that they can be treated, yeah.</span> <span id="s1281">So there -- this was wonderful and it's terrific that I had the power to do this.</span> <span id="s1282">You had to take, every morning to take a bottle of petrol (ph.) and to clean the floor because this is disinfection against lice and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1283">And the man, , was his name, he was holding there -- the magazines with all these relic things which he needs for the office and so on.</span> <span id="s1284">And he was terrible, he called Gert -- he told her "dirty Jew."</span> <span id="s1285">And it was unbelievable how she had to suffer.</span> <span id="s1286">He beat her sometimes and I don't know how I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: And everyone thought you were a dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: There was nobody who didn't think I was a dentist but nobody had doubt or something.</span> <span id="s1289">So it was absolutely all right.</span> <span id="s1290">And every day I got a paper which is written, "Samuel Flor and his wife Gertrude Flor have the right to go this street and this street every morning and back every evening, the same street back to the hospital" -- "from the hospital to the camp."</span> <span id="s1291">We are to sleep in the camp and so on.</span> <span id="s1292">One day I went home and Gertrude -- and there was a peasant who had barn next to the camp.</span> <span id="s1293">And he cleaned the barn.</span> <span id="s1294">It smelled terrible but it's a barn, it was clean, with a heap of -- how you call it -- .</span> <span id="s1295">So I took this and I looked and then, all of the sudden, in this big pile of junk, I saw a ladies shoe.</span> <span id="s1296">I grabbed the shoe for Gertrude and so it's good.</span> <span id="s1297">And then -- but when I pulled the shoe, I got resistance.</span> <span id="s1298">So I pulled more.</span> <span id="s1299">I pulled out a boy.</span> <span id="s1300">A whole boy was there.</span> <span id="s1301">He wore two left lady shoes.</span> <span id="s1302">So I asked him, "Who are you?</span> <span id="s1303">Why can't you tell me?"</span> <span id="s1304">And I asked, "Gertrude, should we take him in?"</span> <span id="s1305">So we took him in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Now the camp is -- A: Besides barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: The name of this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Had no name, yeah.</span> <span id="s1309">And we took him in and everybody got one potato on charcoal.</span> <span id="s1310">And I asked "Gertrude, can we give him one?"</span> <span id="s1311">"Okay, give him one."</span> <span id="s1312">And I got one, and she got one, and he got one.</span> <span id="s1313">And he stood there and rubbed it on his arm and on his belly.</span> <span id="s1314">And so it was good.</span> <span id="s1315">But he didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s1316">But then we asked him, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s1317">Don't answer.</span> <span id="s1318">"If there will be a word I will talk.</span> <span id="s1319">No word, I don't talk."</span> <span id="s1320">Okay.</span> <span id="s1321">And then we sat down and started to eat the potato and looked up.</span> <span id="s1322">He's done.</span> <span id="s1323">Okay.</span> <span id="s1324">.</span> <span id="s1325">So he went.</span> <span id="s1326">After two minutes he was in again.</span> <span id="s1327">And he said -- , house and says, "More" -- "one more outside."</span> <span id="s1328">I said, "Look, you don't want to eat with us?"</span> <span id="s1329">And he want -- "You just don't want to talk to us, so what the hell is wrong with you?"</span> <span id="s1330">He said, "I have to bring him in."</span> <span id="s1331">"Okay, bring him in."</span> <span id="s1332">He brought in him and in walked a pair of German britches.</span> <span id="s1333">You know what the britches; are riding pants.</span> <span id="s1334">Bound together on top, so I pulled the cord, fell down, naked stood the little boy.</span> <span id="s1335">This little boy must have been six, seven.</span> <span id="s1336">He must been ten, something like that.</span> <span id="s1337">"I am David.</span> <span id="s1338">I was at an execution (ph.) now and now we are running here and now we are from there and there, the town ."</span> <span id="s1339">And he talks a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">And the man who was the roofer said, "You know, I will take the big one.</span> <span id="s1341">My father was shot last week, you know, and his name was Yocannon (ph.)."</span> <span id="s1342">You know, Yocannon, the biblical name.</span> <span id="s1343">"So I'll call him Yocannon."</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1345">And he took him to the hospital and in the hospital the boy climbed the ladder and brought a hot iron to iron the roof and so was it was very nice.</span> <span id="s1346">There was a bookkeeper in the hospital, a Romanian -- End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: You were listening to your wife's interview.</span> <span id="s1349">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Was there anything else, any stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Her girlfriends were standing on the river there, and everybody here had a pair of shoes, a pair of socks, underwear, I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1352">We had one crazy man.</span> <span id="s1353">We made him the captain of all the crazies.</span> <span id="s1354">So he was the captain.</span> <span id="s1355">His name was Ishkavitz (ph.).</span> <span id="s1356">And he beat up the other crazy, but there was life in the boy, so very good.</span> <span id="s1357">Now, he stands there, he has nothing to sell, to give, he stands there and looks with his open mouth and one has, on a green leaf a piece of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1359">I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1360">I thought we were rolling now.</span> <span id="s1361">We're not.</span> <span id="s1362">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: So I want start the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Did you ?</span> <span id="s1365">Okay.</span> <span id="s1366">On this Sunday, all the women ran to this little river.</span> <span id="s1367">Q: Where is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: , and have a pair of shoes, a pair of underwear, and a pair of socks, so on.</span> <span id="s1369">And this peasant woman looked at one thing and there were holes in what the peasant woman had, and then -- okay, she dropped it, too.</span> <span id="s1370">And she goes on and looks.</span> <span id="s1371">This is the way the bargains go here.</span> <span id="s1372">Here stands Ishkavitz, the captain of all the crazy guys, he stands there and he looks what's going on.</span> <span id="s1373">Stands there .</span> <span id="s1374">Okay.</span> <span id="s1375">And all of the sudden, with his open mouth, he falls on the hand of one woman which has a piece of butter on a green leaf, and has it all on his mouth and with his face into the water.</span> <span id="s1376">And he swallows and he chews and so on.</span> <span id="s1377">And then he gets up and says .</span> <span id="s1378">It means for afraid.</span> <span id="s1379">Because woman are afraid of him and, therefore, it didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1380">And here was a story Gertrude tells you.</span> <span id="s1381">And she remembers the story for sure because if I will tell it to her she will sure remember.</span> <span id="s1382">Okay, there is a story.</span> <span id="s1383">Now it's your turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: My turn.</span> <span id="s1385">Is there anything else about Tuccin or about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: , no.</span> <span id="s1387">About , there is nothing anymore to say.</span> <span id="s1388">About Tuccin, many things, but there are two little things.</span> <span id="s1389">For instance, I come in back, I'm just finished with a patient, and Gertrude said -- tears come out of her eye.</span> <span id="s1390">"Gertrude, what is it with you?"</span> <span id="s1391">She can hardly talk, but then I see she has a mouthful of something.</span> <span id="s1392">Okay, because she was so starving always, more than everybody else.</span> <span id="s1393">"When can I eat something, a little bit?"</span> <span id="s1394">And she had -- the woman had a cherry pie in her bosom.</span> <span id="s1395">I put a little huginal in the woman, it should not hurt her and go home.</span> <span id="s1396">I say, "Can't do anything.</span> <span id="s1397">I have to pull your tooth."</span> <span id="s1398">"No, pull, please.</span> <span id="s1399">No pull."</span> <span id="s1400">"You sit down, I put away."</span> <span id="s1401">And now she brought us a little cherry pie and want to bride Gertrude, she should bribe me, I should not pull the tooth.</span> <span id="s1402">And Gertrude, what did she do?</span> <span id="s1403">Put the cherry pie into her mouth and I stood there with a full mouth, she just ate the cherry pie.</span> <span id="s1404">I pulled the tooth.</span> <span id="s1405">I had enough of this.</span> <span id="s1406">I could say, which are many of those.</span> <span id="s1407">And there are -- they are important.</span> <span id="s1408">But so told in three minutes or in five minutes told, your life in Tuccin , it's impossible.</span> <span id="s1409">It's very hard.</span> <span id="s1410">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s1411">because this short beautiful story with the cherry pie in her mouth, this has hundred in ends and starting because I can get killed at any moment for this story.</span> <span id="s1412">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Did you feel that all of the time?</span> <span id="s1414">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: That your life was so precarious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1417">And I had a man, he was a major -- no, if one has no insignia (ph.), he's the most dangerous.</span> <span id="s1418">You don't know what he is.</span> <span id="s1419">So therefore, I think he was a major.</span> <span id="s1420">It was Fritz Fronrodi (ph.), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: From which army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: From the German army, yes, he was Fritz Fronrodi.</span> <span id="s1423">One evening, late night, somebody yelled, "Samuel Flor, dentist."</span> <span id="s1424">Oh, I was called dentist.</span> <span id="s1425">It's bad but good on one side, they don't shoot me until I come out.</span> <span id="s1426">"I have terrible toothache here, here upper tooth and please, you have to do something."</span> <span id="s1427">"We have no electricity."</span> <span id="s1428">"We'll have it right away."</span> <span id="s1429">And he had a little jeep, a Volkswagen, pulls it up on sort of a bridge, we'd say, corrected.</span> <span id="s1430">And now he a light in the office on the table.</span> <span id="s1431">I never saw this man and he says, "I have a terrible toothache.</span> <span id="s1432">Here, here, here.</span> <span id="s1433">Do you see?"</span> <span id="s1434">"Yes, I see."</span> <span id="s1435">And I said, "I cannot help you.</span> <span id="s1436">I cannot see the instruments.</span> <span id="s1437">I cannot see."</span> <span id="s1438">"No, you will help me because I don't go home.</span> <span id="s1439">I don't -- I want to sleep."</span> <span id="s1440">So I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1441">And then I wait.</span> <span id="s1442">So therefore, I go out.</span> <span id="s1443">Next to him stands a blond beautiful -- how do you say it in English?</span> <span id="s1444">She is like a .</span> <span id="s1445">So she stands there and he says, (moan).</span> <span id="s1446">And the guy build us the bridge.</span> <span id="s1447">I said a ramp or something.</span> <span id="s1448">"Okay, let's go."</span> <span id="s1449">We go in his car.</span> <span id="s1450">And then what do you thing when I say we go in his car?</span> <span id="s1451">To him it's nothing.</span> <span id="s1452">You go his car.</span> <span id="s1453">No, it is terrible, you cannot sit in a car with a major, somebody.</span> <span id="s1454">It's terrible.</span> <span id="s1455">Okay, we go in his car and come there.</span> <span id="s1456">Sure enough, they had this Volkswagen on the ramp, and the light in, yes, I see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">And now, "Okay, now you have to pull tooth."</span> <span id="s1458">"I don't have to pull the tooth."</span> <span id="s1459">"What?"</span> <span id="s1460">"Here is the tooth.</span> <span id="s1461">How can I pull your from my fingers?"</span> <span id="s1462">"How?</span> <span id="s1463">You have pulled it already?"</span> <span id="s1464">"Yes."</span> <span id="s1465">"That's nice.</span> <span id="s1466">Okay, pull them all."</span> <span id="s1467">"I cannot pull them all.</span> <span id="s1468">You will come in two days, I will pull the next.</span> <span id="s1469">In two days, I will pull the next.</span> <span id="s1470">I don't pull all in one day."</span> <span id="s1471">"Okay, that's good.</span> <span id="s1472">Good, terrific."</span> <span id="s1473">Really I .</span> <span id="s1474">Okay I know what to do.</span> <span id="s1475">Now, this guy comes every second day, as I said, at five o'clock because he is busy until five.</span> <span id="s1476">And then he says, "I am worried."</span> <span id="s1477">He opens his cigarette case and gives me a cigarette.</span> <span id="s1478">"Oh, boy, a cigarette, thank you."</span> <span id="s1479">But I have cigarettes and I am very happy and I smoke a cigarette with him.</span> <span id="s1480">He says, "I'm worried."</span> <span id="s1481">"Oh?"</span> <span id="s1482">"You know why I am worried?"</span> <span id="s1483">"No."</span> <span id="s1484">"I am worried about the German youths."</span> <span id="s1485">"Really?"</span> <span id="s1486">"Do you know what they did?</span> <span id="s1487">I get 500 to lay flat."</span> <span id="s1488">That means to shot them.</span> <span id="s1489">"So 500, one young guy count and count.</span> <span id="s1490">He goes and counts, counts, and counts, and comes back and says .</span> <span id="s1491">"We have only 308."</span> <span id="s1492">"My goodness, how can I do something like that?</span> <span id="s1493">I never beat a Jew.</span> <span id="s1494">Never in my life.</span> <span id="s1495">I never touched a Jew.</span> <span id="s1496">I killed some 20,000 but I never touched one.</span> <span id="s1497">But it's not a war against Jews, this is all war for humanity."</span> <span id="s1498">"Oh, now I know."</span> <span id="s1499">"And therefore, how can you do this to me here, he gives me 308 cartridges."</span> <span id="s1500">So he became so inamate (ph.) of us, that he so feel with him that he suffers.</span> <span id="s1501">So he suffers.</span> <span id="s1502">He wanted to take us out and -- Gertrude and me, he wants to take out her.</span> <span id="s1503">So Gertrude, Schmidt, to and they put us on a speed boat and take us to and we are free.</span> <span id="s1504">I said, "No, I have a mother and a sister."</span> <span id="s1505">"Oh, I cannot do anything."</span> <span id="s1506">So it was a whole story that he wanted to do nice things for us, but he laid flat 500 Jews here.</span> <span id="s1507">And so I said, said so, that this is Jew for humanity and not against Jews.</span> <span id="s1508">So I shouldn't worry about the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Were you ever worried when you were pulling teeth on German soldiers that you might do something terribly wrong --</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: -- because you didn't have training and what the repercussions would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: No, because really the repercussions, if I break a tooth, which happens.</span> <span id="s1513">So I break and then I fill it up and take out the root.</span> <span id="s1514">But never happen to me with root canal.</span> <span id="s1515">Boy this was really a God's giving because they send it in a box very nicely and all the directions what I should do.</span> <span id="s1516">I could be blind and do it.</span> <span id="s1517">It was terrific.</span> <span id="s1518">I was very happy that I could do such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: You did a root canal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Let me -- I did many root canal because, all of the sudden, an office -- "Doctor, here is something for the dental department.</span> <span id="s1521">Must be for you.</span> <span id="s1522">We don't have any other."</span> <span id="s1523">And I looked, there were boxes with treatment of root canal.</span> <span id="s1524">So I had -- this is good.</span> <span id="s1525">Now I can read and excellent, how to do it and what to do.</span> <span id="s1526">This was really a God given thing, those boxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Your -- your sister and mother were in Tuccin also?</span> <span id="s1528">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: What happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: They were sent to .</span> <span id="s1531">Do you know what is?</span> <span id="s1532">Okay.</span> <span id="s1533">They -- and they were up to their knees in water and their knees were blue and they were frozen, but it was all right.</span> <span id="s1534">But then when we came to Chernivtsi all together, and this woman looked here, she was looking for lice, she said, "Hey, Professor, don't go there .</span> <span id="s1535">Because there they get people.</span> <span id="s1536">Go out to the woods here and to the felony (ph.)."</span> <span id="s1537">"Okay, I promise."</span> <span id="s1538">And this was a very tough thing because the Russians had corners where they kept a few soldiers and everybody they took them to or heaven knows where -- Far East.</span> <span id="s1539">People they should work .</span> <span id="s1540">And they took you to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1541">So, therefore, it was not pleasant.</span> <span id="s1542">And I went up, and when I come to the felony, Gertrude started to cry the steps up.</span> <span id="s1543">And I said, "Please, don't cry, yet."</span> <span id="s1544">And I take her hands and I shake her.</span> <span id="s1545">"Please, you cannot cry.</span> <span id="s1546">You must smile all the time."</span> <span id="s1547">"Okay."</span> <span id="s1548">And she come in there and Mr. Hess (ph.), the bookkeeper, and he looks at us, "Oh, you're here again.</span> <span id="s1549">Okay, sit down and play."</span> <span id="s1550">"Yeah, Mr. Hess, I have to do something with Gertrude.</span> <span id="s1551">You see, she don't feel good for a moment."</span> <span id="s1552">And I take her into the ladies room -- I in the ladies room -- and I say, "Gertrude, do you want to kill us?</span> <span id="s1553">It's new director and a new people.</span> <span id="s1554">Don't cry.</span> <span id="s1555">Please, don't cry."</span> <span id="s1556">So -- and I had to play the same evening to .</span> <span id="s1557">So I played, smile.</span> <span id="s1558">"Sure, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1559">I am happy to do it."</span> <span id="s1560">And this was the situation that I tried always to keep Gertrude from giving out her fear.</span> <span id="s1561">And so everything, "Don't give it.</span> <span id="s1562">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1563">And they know it."</span> <span id="s1564">And don't wonder they should be so involved in this.</span> <span id="s1565">"Forget about it, it's not your business.</span> <span id="s1566">And if you want to be free, you can sit and cry as much as you want, but here we cannot do it."</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: I'm trying to understand when you got separated from your mother and sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: We came to Chernivtsi, went up there into our apartment and there were two women who said, "You will not be long the owners.</span> <span id="s1569">You are capitalist.</span> <span id="s1570">You cannot be .</span> <span id="s1571">And we go immediately to the " -- which is the secret police -- "and tell them that you are ."</span> <span id="s1572">And they were very eager to get people from the camp because they always said, "If you are not good for the Germans, you're not good for the Russians."</span> <span id="s1573">So -- and therefore, my mother and my sister were there, and then I said, "We go to the Czech army."</span> <span id="s1574">And mother cried a little, and my sister, a little less.</span> <span id="s1575">And we went to the Czech army, and my sister said, "So beautiful two people, they take away.</span> <span id="s1576">Oh, no, whatever will happen to me here?</span> <span id="s1577">And you'd like to be killed here?"</span> <span id="s1578">And I said, "Uh-huh."</span> <span id="s1579">I like it there much better.</span> <span id="s1580">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Did they make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1583">They went to the DP camp in Salsburg (ph.).</span> <span id="s1584">.</span> <span id="s1585">But there was such anti-Semitism in the DP camps.</span> <span id="s1586">The leaders of the camps, which were Americans, they said, " go here and you will go to America."</span> <span id="s1587">So what do you know, the main thing was at these camps, that the people should say from where they are.</span> <span id="s1588">And they must invent a town in Germany.</span> <span id="s1589">But what this means, they must invent -- they must invent a town which is under Russian occupation so nobody can control them anymore.</span> <span id="s1590">So I found a town , and this saved their life.</span> <span

story.</span> <span id="s1686">He said, "Okay, you will play the over here."</span> <span id="s1687">Good, I will play and I am very happy.</span> <span id="s1688">So he want to give me money, I didn't take any money.</span> <span id="s1689">I didn't want to because I promised this to a man who died.</span> <span id="s1690">Did we have problems burying him.</span> <span id="s1691">It was two days we slept with the dead man and then we asked how to do we get rid of him.</span> <span id="s1692">Not easy.</span> <span id="s1693">I know the the place, I know the stone.</span> <span id="s1694">What's the difference?</span> <span id="s1695">Must change -- be changed now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: How long were you here before you played with an orchestra again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Very short.</span> <span id="s1698">When I came here I went to the settlement school and was teaching one year.</span> <span id="s1699">But in this one year, I had offers with

<span id="s1706">I didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s1707">We were very poor, but never mind.</span> <span id="s1708">So I save money always in winter to go somewhere in the summer.</span> <span id="s1709">So we decided we would go to Greece, Turkey, Greece and Egypt.</span> <span id="s1710">And then Egypt is in Greece is a cloister.</span> <span id="s1711">It is big, big cloister which starts on the -- on the sea and then you climb up and up and up, because any cloister -- anything starts not on the sea, it starts here or a little higher.</span> <span id="s1712">And this starts -- this is a cloister where only man go.</span> <span id="s1713">No woman is permitted.</span> <span id="s1714">Not even a woman fly, a woman cow, a woman horse, something.</span> <span id="s1715">Really, it's true.</span> <span id="s1716">And then they have meetings where they don't talk.</span> <span id="s1717">Just a silent meetings.</span> <span id="s1718">I don't know what the hell they do there, that's it.</span> <span id="s1719">And sit for hours.</span> <span id="s1720">And therefore, most of the people are from , Arabia.</span> <span id="s1721">It was an old Greek orthodox.</span> <span id="s1722">And they have their -- they pray and then they have invited guests.</span> <span id="s1723">And they say, "Okay, I will sleep here.</span> <span id="s1724">Just throw me a straw pillow.</span> <span id="s1725">And for my friend, also a straw pillow, on the floor there."</span> <span id="s1726">Okay.</span> <span id="s1727">Now we have two pillows.</span> <span id="s1728">Now we lay down and want to sleep and the man next to us (sigh) (sigh).</span> <span id="s1729">So he goes on after that.</span> <span id="s1730">And it was bad habit.</span> <span id="s1731">And I didn't know what to do with this man and then it was very interesting, his behavior and his lying there on the floor.</span> <span id="s1732">And then I came here, it was in 1947.</span> <span id="s1733">And in '47, I told this man about the cloister.</span> <span id="s1734">He said, "This was you?"</span> <span id="s1735">"Yes, it was me."</span> <span id="s1736">"It was
