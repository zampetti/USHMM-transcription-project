and this is Natalie Packel interviewing Ellen Tarlow, for the Gratz College Holocaust Archive.</span> <span id="s3">Ellen, could you tell me where you were born, and a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">ET: Sure.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Gü tersloh, in Westfalen, Westphalia to you, in Ger many.</span> <span id="s6">It is northwest Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">NP: Could you tell me a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">ET: Certainly.</span> <span id="s9">My parents in particular.</span> <span id="s10">I'm an only child, and I was born in 1927, December 18th.</span> <span id="s11">My father was Paul Meinberg.</span> <span id="s12">My mother was Ilse Meinberg, nee Cappel in English, I suppose.</span> <span id="s13">I might have had more siblings, but times being what they were, my parents made an early decision that that was it.</span> <span id="s14">And we lived alone, my parents and I, for about five years, and then joined the family home with my grandparents in a very, very large, beautiful home.</span> <span id="s15">I think of it now as very, very beautiful.</span> <span id="s16">When I was young, I thought it was a very old-fashioned house.</span> <span id="s17">And now I appreciate its beauty greatly.</span> <span id="s18">It was a three-story house with seven bedrooms.</span> <span id="s19">And it was a wonderful place to live.</span> <span id="s20">I did miss not having siblings.</span> <span id="s21">There were too many adults in my life.</span> <span id="s22">But there were a lot of cousins who visited every summer, so that made life a little more exciting for me.</span> <span id="s23">And that's the immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">NP: What was your life like before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">ET: It was wonderful, and it took me many, many years to be able to say that it truly was wonderful.</span> <span id="s26">Because, I think that when one has escaped and is so grateful to have gotten out and to be living in this country, one tends to say, "Well, it wasn't so wonder ful."</span> <span id="s27">But it was.</span> <span id="s28">And when one matures, one sees its beauty.</span> <span id="s29">It was a very small, magni ficent little town.</span> <span id="s30">My son, on, during his visit there described it as a garden town.</span> <span id="s31">It had a lot of physical beauty, and the area in which we lived might have been compared to a small town Rittenhouse Square.</span> <span id="s32">There was a triangle park.</span> <span id="s33">The house was about a hundred and, I'm not sure, 120 or 30 years old.</span> <span id="s34">And, there was a maid—a cleaning lady—and a house man, and all the wonderful little extras one had then.</span> <span id="s35">And life was leisurely.</span> <span id="s36">And I enjoyed it very much.</span> <span id="s37">And the overtones of the Nazi regime did not become evident to me until I was about six.</span> <span id="s38">So having been born at the age, at 1927, at the end of that year, for me it was about 1933 or '4 until some things in the air told me that there was trouble.</span> <span id="s39">And I was a very articulate child and I perceived very quickly.</span> <span id="s40">And I quietly understood things, such as Hitler's election, quite well.</span> <span id="s41">My parents did not receive a gold button during the election, which indicated they had not voted for Hitler.</span> <span id="s42">And I didn't understand it, but I knew that we were different.</span> <span id="s43">But it was an elegant life, a cultured life, a leisurely life.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">NP: If we could go back a little bit, your father's occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">ET: My father was a, it's an unusual term, I guess.</span> <span id="s46">He exported cattle from Bavar ia to Westphalia.</span> <span id="s47">The cattle in Bavaria was very docile, and very easily used by farmers to plow and till the fields.</span> <span id="s48">And so he would travel to Bavaria every winter and obtain these animals, and they would come by cattle car to our home, not...home, but two blocks in back of the property we had huge stables.</span> <span id="s49">And it was always a very exciting time in the winter when all the farmers came, made their purchases, and we would have twelve people to dinner every day, and there was a lot going on, and that was his livelihood.</span> <span id="s50">And it was third or fourth generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">NP: Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">ET: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NP: Your school experiences.</span> <span id="s54">Did you feel any overtones, undertones and trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s56">In Germany, I'm sure you are aware, you attend public school for four years, and then you enter Gymnasium for boys and Lyceum as we called it for girls.</span> <span id="s57">And my first years were in public school and I do remember when I was eight that someone on the way to school called me a Jew, a young girl and...her friend.</span> <span id="s58">And I was very angry, and I hit her.</span> <span id="s59">And, when I came home from school my father took me into his study and he said, "You will not be able to do that again, because her father is an S.A. man, and he said that she can call you a Jew and you'll have to live with that.</span> <span id="s60">So just be passive and accept it."</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NP: S.A.?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">ET: S.A. Sturm...that was the Brown Shirts.</span> <span id="s63">They were the Brown Shirts.</span> <span id="s64">They were the rabble of Germany, and they were the Brown Shirts with the swastika.</span> <span id="s65">They were really his first little band of looters who ran around.</span> <span id="s66">They were not the refined S.S. troops, the elite.</span> <span id="s67">It was real-, they were really, basic citizens who dressed up in uniform and became strong men at the end of the day.</span> <span id="s68">So that was my first experience, and I learned then very quietly that even though I would be called a Jew, that I could not retaliate.</span> <span id="s69">Then, in 1938, in March, I entered Lyceum, which is your equivalent, I imagine, of a..</span> <span id="s70">.</span> <span id="s71">well, I, it's private school and, but it is in preparation for college.</span> <span id="s72">You cannot enter college unless you attend a Lyceum and Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">NP: Excuse me, that, in English that's L-Y-C-E-U-M?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s75">In French I imagine Lyceé would be it.</span> <span id="s76">Today, the schools are called Gymnasium for both sexes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">ET: But they were separated girls and boys, and situated in different parts of the town.</span> <span id="s79">I loved that school.</span> <span id="s80">I found out later in life that when it was founded at the end of the 19th century, my aunt was the first "Jewish daughter" of the town to have attended.</span> <span id="s81">I was the last.</span> <span id="s82">And, it was a very refined atmosphere.</span> <span id="s83">The teachers were hand chosen, hand chosen [chuckles] personally chosen, and I learned, I had the beginnings of language.</span> <span id="s84">You needed to learn two languages to graduate.</span> <span id="s85">You would be 19 at graduation, and I started English and the education was elitist.</span> <span id="s86">I loved school.</span> <span id="s87">I imagine that's unusual.</span> <span id="s88">Most kids say they hate it; I really adored it.</span> <span id="s89">And I did not feel any overtones there.</span> <span id="s90">I was the only Jewish child in that school.</span> <span id="s91">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s92">The town consisted of about 32,000 people, and there were not that many Jewish families there.</span> <span id="s93">So there was always an age difference of who was attending where and what.</span> <span id="s94">I didn't feel anything until the summer of '38 when, this was probably the most traumatic experience, other than Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s95">We had prepared during gym class, with swimming exercise, and we would be taken to the public pool in the summer and actually learn to swim.</span> <span id="s96">And I was so excited, because I really wanted to go.</span> <span id="s97">And the day we were to leave, the gym teacher, who was quite a lovely lady and I don't perceive her now as having been really anti-Semitic, took me aside and she said, "You will not be able to go.</span> <span id="s98">You know why."</span> <span id="s99">And I said, "Yes, I know."</span> <span id="s100">She said, "Jews, as you know, cannot go to public pools."</span> <span id="s101">Which I had known.</span> <span id="s102">I always thought that I could sneak through because I was with the school.</span> <span id="s103">And I thought maybe, and I would not be noticed.</span> <span id="s104">So, I went home.</span> <span id="s105">This was every Wednesday.</span> <span id="s106">The first time I went home I..</span> <span id="s107">.</span> <span id="s108">just cried.</span> <span id="s109">And I was so lonely.</span> <span id="s110">And I could not believe this was happening to me.</span> <span id="s111">And at the same time I felt that if I would tell my parents, if I were to tell them what...had happened to me, they would feel so awful.</span> <span id="s112">So, I mitigated my little message and I said to my mother, "I really can't go and I guess you know why, because Jews can't go to these places."</span> <span id="s113">And I saw in her eyes a quiet desperation.</span> <span id="s114">I don't know which was worse, to see the secondary pain, or my primary pain.</span> <span id="s115">She took me out to a little bakery and bought me a chocolate puff.</span> <span id="s116">And every Wednesday this continued through the summer.</span> <span id="s117">I quietly walked home, and I cried, and everyone went out to swim, and my mother went out to the bakery with me.</span> <span id="s118">And I have never, ever gotten over that experience of total isolation.</span> <span id="s119">I learned to swim in this country in my early 30s.</span> <span id="s120">A friend taught me.</span> <span id="s121">And that was my greatest personal victory.</span> <span id="s122">And when I saw my children swim, beautifully gliding through the water—in this country—and my grandchildren, I can only think of myself as having been denied that one little thing.</span> <span id="s123">And that then was the major beginning.</span> <span id="s124">And my schooling was terminated at the end of the year.</span> <span id="s125">Crystal Night took place Novem ber of 1938, and two days later an edict came forth terminating all Jewish children from German schools.</span> <span id="s126">That was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">NP: Did you have any, did you attend a religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">ET: Oh yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s129">I don't know how I could have forgotten that.</span> <span id="s130">We had a small, lovely little synagogue.</span> <span id="s131">And outside the synagogue was a little house, I guess it'd be like the Little Schoolhouse on the Prairie [chuckles].</span> <span id="s132">And we attended that with our rabbi one day a week, from 12 to almost 6.</span> <span id="s133">And at the age of 6 I was taught Hebrew, and all the stories of the Old Testament.</span> <span id="s134">And we also had what we called Ivrit, which is the Hebrew of New Israel—then it was called Palestine—just in case that we might go to Is rael.</span> <span id="s135">So that was an in-depth education and it was reinforced at home by my grand mo ther, who could read Hebrew and practice all the b’ruchas with me and the reading and I very much enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s136">And of course in 1938 the synagogues were burned and that was another termination.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">NP: Did the family belong to any Jewish organizations that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">ET: Well, they were all part of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">ET: And everything went through what we called the Chevra in those days.</span> <span id="s141">The or ganizations were with the women, contrary to what anyone, I imagine, practices or knows about here, were the...funeral directors when someone died.</span> <span id="s142">The women washed the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">NP: So that was the Chevra Kaddishah?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">ET: Oh yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s145">And we had a quiet organization in each town.</span> <span id="s146">When, very often eastern Jews traveled through destination I imagine this country or whatever, and they were quietly tended to by the women of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s147">They were given food, shelter, and clothing, and sent on with names to other congregations.</span> <span id="s148">So it wasn't as or ganized as I would perceive it to be here such as the Hadassah movement.</span> <span id="s149">It was a quiet, I guess you would call it tzedakah, it was just something that you, it was taken for granted that we did.</span> <span id="s150">And the men had what we know here as a men's club.</span> <span id="s151">But it was functional.</span> <span id="s152">It had to do with administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">NP: And then you were saying in 1938, I..</span> <span id="s154">.</span> <span id="s155">think I interrupted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">ET: Let me think...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">NP: You were talking about, then the schools were closed to Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s159">There was an edict.</span> <span id="s160">And no Jewish child could attend a German school.</span> <span id="s161">And so I went, well, our house was burned and I think that should be covered by a separate chapter by you because it was the most intense experience of my life and...</span></p> <p><span id="s162">NP: However you wish to proceed...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">ET: Well, I will, maybe we should do that now because my life so radically changed after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">NP: May I first ask you a couple of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">ET: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NP: Did any of your family members serve in any national army?</span> <span id="s167">Well, I know your grandfather did.</span> <span id="s168">Your father, anybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">ET: My father volunteered at the age of 19 in World War I to fight for his country.</span> <span id="s170">That is a very difficult thing for my friends and relatives to understand now.</span> <span id="s171">But one has to realize that in 1914, one was a German Jew as one is an American Jew here, and that was our country.</span> <span id="s172">My family, dating, both date back a long time.</span> <span id="s173">My father's family dates back to 1692, and my mother's possibly the same.</span> <span id="s174">I have record of early 17, 18 or so.</span> <span id="s175">So one was German, and one fought.</span> <span id="s176">My father volunteered.</span> <span id="s177">He was in the thick of it in France.</span> <span id="s178">He was in the trenches.</span> <span id="s179">He was heavily wounded.</span> <span id="s180">He almost died.</span> <span id="s181">He al most bled to death.</span> <span id="s182">He had shrapnels in his back, and he was nursed back to health for one year, and he survived it.</span> <span id="s183">He was given the Iron Cross First Class, which is one of the highest decora tions.</span> <span id="s184">He was very proud of it.</span> <span id="s185">He thought that that would save his life eventually.</span> <span id="s186">Well, it did not.</span> <span id="s187">He was fiercely German until it was proven that he was not considered a German.</span> <span id="s188">But then, in our town there were two men who died for that country, actually two brothers.</span> <span id="s189">So everyone partook.</span> <span id="s190">My grandfather, too, was a cavalry officer in, he served in Russia for two years fighting the Cossacks in World War I.</span> <span id="s191">That was what one did.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">NP: And your family's reaction then to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in '33?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">ET: It was different.</span> <span id="s194">My mother seemed to foresee doom, black doom.</span> <span id="s195">[chuckles] My father was very confident.</span> <span id="s196">He felt very secure in a town where he had been an import ant person and his family had been known forever, and he thought nothing would ever touch him.</span> <span id="s197">The invasion of the Nazi years was a very slow insidious one.</span> <span id="s198">It was chipping away at one's life in ever so small an increment per day that it was not one fell swoop.</span> <span id="s199">And it, somewhere around the beginning of 1938, my father was called to the town and local authorities to resign from his profession because he was dealing with German farmers, and he was “contaminating their lives.”</span> <span id="s200">I think that was his rude awakening.</span> <span id="s201">It was difficult for him.</span> <span id="s202">And so he was without a position in life.</span> <span id="s203">Luckily one had money to go on there, because life was so much simpler then.</span> <span id="s204">One didn't need all the extras that one uses today, and one could go on.</span> <span id="s205">It was just such a disillusionment.</span> <span id="s206">And then, also during the period of 1937 there was very strong anti-Semitism in the streets at night.</span> <span id="s207">There was sing ing in the streets by the S.A. and the S.S.</span> <span id="s208">There were songs sung that I'm sure all of you have heard, and I..</span> <span id="s209">.</span> <span id="s210">can only translate them.</span> <span id="s211">They would sing marching through the streets at night, "When Jews' blood will run from our knives, the world will be free."</span> <span id="s212">One would say that we should have known at the time that it was time to go, in 1937, but not everyone had the foresight.</span> <span id="s213">My father still firmly believed that it was a transient kind of a thing, that it would go away.</span> <span id="s214">And lots of people did.</span> <span id="s215">He was not the only one.</span> <span id="s216">My mother did not think it would go away.</span> <span id="s217">She kept saying, "They'll kill us, all of us."</span> <span id="s218">And he said, "No, they will not."</span> <span id="s219">The final reality came in 1938 during Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s220">And we knew who we were, and who we were not.</span> <span id="s221">I don't know why our town was hit so terribly hard.</span> <span id="s222">It was not one of the most "anti-Semitic" towns.</span> <span id="s223">There were other areas, in Hessia for in stance, which were known to be highly anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">NP: Could you spell that please?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">ET: H-E-S-S-I-A.</span> <span id="s226">That's the American word for that province.</span> <span id="s227">In German it's Hessen.</span> <span id="s228">H-E-S-S-E-N.</span> <span id="s229">Kissinger's from that area.</span> <span id="s230">That was always considered a, an anti-Semitic area.</span> <span id="s231">I don't know why, but I do remember that.</span> <span id="s232">Our town was just mildly so.</span> <span id="s233">But the night of Crystal Night, oh, somewhere during, somewhere after midnight, we heard a violent crash, and we ran downstairs and we saw that our huge oak door, which is really very heavy, had been thrown into the house, into a Dutch tiled hallway.</span> <span id="s234">And a cold blast came in, and in came about four or five I think tall, six-feet tall, black elite guard, elite S.S. guards, the Death Brigade.</span> <span id="s235">They have a skull and crossbones on their lapel.</span> <span id="s236">Tall, young, blond.</span> <span id="s237">They had huge axes with them, and with the axes and with their boots they had crashed the door open.</span> <span id="s238">They came through the house, tearing, banging, crashing, destroy ing.</span> <span id="s239">I think it took ten minutes, but I think it was ten years of my life.</span> <span id="s240">I stood on top of the stairs with my parents holding me.</span> <span id="s241">Luckily my grandparents were not home.</span> <span id="s242">They were at a rest haven in a hospital, just sort of being taken care of, a little arthritis and a little that.</span> <span id="s243">They were not there.</span> <span id="s244">And my parents held me.</span> <span id="s245">We were in our night clothes.</span> <span id="s246">We had pa jamas and etcetera on.</span> <span id="s247">And we watched from the top of the stairs as they systematically destroyed everything that we owned.</span> <span id="s248">The axes were, it seemed to me, ten feet long.</span> <span id="s249">I don't know how long they were, but they appeared it.</span> <span id="s250">They raised them high, they crashed the china closets.</span> <span id="s251">They crashed my father's desk.</span> <span id="s252">They cut the wires to the electricity.</span> <span id="s253">They destroyed all there was.</span> <span id="s254">I just remember my mother cringing and screaming as every tea cup rolled by, as her life was slowly decimated and destroyed.</span> <span id="s255">The only room not de stroyed was my room.</span> <span id="s256">Oh, I forgot to mention.</span> <span id="s257">When the first assault came, an S.S. man appeared on top of my bed, with his hand raised, with a, an axe in one and a Luger in the other.</span> <span id="s258">And I was not quite 11.</span> <span id="s259">And that is really, other than the crash of the door, which woke me.</span> <span id="s260">And I screamed as I saw him and I said, "Don't kill me!"</span> <span id="s261">And I remember, I was not quite 11, that he was a very handsome, tall blond man.</span> <span id="s262">And he was probably no more than 21 anyway.</span> <span id="s263">And he said, "I won't kill you.</span> <span id="s264">Just do as I say.</span> <span id="s265">Get up!"</span> <span id="s266">And that's when I joined my parents on top of the stairs.</span> <span id="s267">He did not touch my room.</span> <span id="s268">That is the only room that was untouched.</span> <span id="s269">But they absolutely and totally crashed and destroyed everything that not only my mother's lifetime, my grandmother's lifetime, but mothers before them had collected and favored and loved.</span> <span id="s270">It was a shamble, and hence the word Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s271">The windows were crashed, the furniture, the clocks, the pots, pans, all that there was.</span> <span id="s272">Wires were cut.</span> <span id="s273">And they left.</span> <span id="s274">And we were numb.</span> <span id="s275">There was no light.</span> <span id="s276">They had cut every thing, the electricity.</span> <span id="s277">And we were in shock.</span> <span id="s278">My father was a very together person.</span> <span id="s279">My mother was more tender, I would say, and tended more towards hysteria.</span> <span id="s280">Of course that's understandable at this point.</span> <span id="s281">I was very calm.</span> <span id="s282">I internalize a great deal.</span> <span id="s283">We went into my room because it was untouched, and we said, "Well, we'll get ourselves together in the morning.</span> <span id="s284">We'll get out of here and we'll see what we'll do."</span> <span id="s285">And my mother, who always saw as my father said, "Everything is black with you," said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s286">I think they're going to burn this house."</span> <span id="s287">And he said, "Why do you say that?</span> <span id="s288">You always think the worst."</span> <span id="s289">She said, "Well, the worst has happened."</span> <span id="s290">So we huddled in my little bed, and about an hour-and-a-half later we heard steps in the back.</span> <span id="s291">We had a two-block property.</span> <span id="s292">It was the main house, a garden, and then a play garden and beyond that two blocks at the end of that were the stables and a huge meadow.</span> <span id="s293">We heard them in the back.</span> <span id="s294">And the next thing is what we smelled.</span> <span id="s295">We smelled gasoline and flames.</span> <span id="s296">And the staircase had been decimated to a point that there was no railing.</span> <span id="s297">They had cut that off.</span> <span id="s298">And it was strewn with glass and crystal.</span> <span id="s299">And there was no light.</span> <span id="s300">So, we smelled this suffocating odor of burning gasoline rags.</span> <span id="s301">What they had done is they had set fire to the drapes in each front room of the house, and the blaze was really encroaching upon us.</span> <span id="s302">And they laughed at us.</span> <span id="s303">"Jews, if you can get out, go ahead."</span> <span id="s304">And I remembered having just gotten a beautiful navy camel's hair coat and I really wanted it.</span> <span id="s305">I ran into my closet and I got it.</span> <span id="s306">And I don't know by what luck God made me do it.</span> <span id="s307">I pulled my father's coat out.</span> <span id="s308">My room was the moth closet.</span> <span id="s309">I pulled a coat out for my father.</span> <span id="s310">He was in his nightshirt.</span> <span id="s311">I threw it to him, and I got one for my mother.</span> <span id="s312">I really had wanted my coat so badly that I found theirs.</span> <span id="s313">And we somehow got out of that burning inferno.</span> <span id="s314">There we were in the street around four, four-thirty in the morn ing, and looking back I knew that the whole thing had really...been orchestrated, be cause there was the town head policeman, and there were people assembled, and the fire engines had come to extinguish nothing, but to just be there and protect the neighbors' homes.</span> <span id="s315">That's what they were there for.</span> <span id="s316">And more S.S. men.</span> <span id="s317">And as we just had come running out of the house and the flames were really licking at it, my father was taken away, in front of my mother, and in front of me, and handcuffed, by a policeman who my grand father had taken care of all his life because his family needed money.</span> <span id="s318">And, I ran up to the policeman and I said, "Why are you taking my father?</span> <span id="s319">He hasn't done anything!"</span> <span id="s320">Being not quite 11, one equates arrest with a violation.</span> <span id="s321">And he just smiled at me and he said, "There's nothing I can do."</span> <span id="s322">And my mother at that point was at near collapse.</span> <span id="s323">And, my father was removed.</span> <span id="s324">She was 36 years old.</span> <span id="s325">She had lost all her physical possessions, her husband taken away, and she and I stood in front of the house.</span> <span id="s326">Everyone removed themselves, took my father, and it was a quiet, cold, awful night.</span> <span id="s327">We looked at the house.</span> <span id="s328">It was burning.</span> <span id="s329">No neighbor came out.</span> <span id="s330">And we stood, and we were dazed.</span> <span id="s331">And I think, and I've said this very often, that at that point I became my mother's mother.</span> <span id="s332">I was the stronger.</span> <span id="s333">And we thought that we would go to the hospital where my grandparents were, my father's parents.</span> <span id="s334">And on the way to the hospital we had to pass the synagogue, which was in, absolutely engulfed in flames.</span> <span id="s335">That had been totally set on fire at the beginning of the burning of our house.</span> <span id="s336">And we knew then that this...was it, this was the time in the night that we were no longer Germans.</span> <span id="s337">We were nothing.</span> <span id="s338">We went to the hospital and Mother Superior, who we knew very well, let us in.</span> <span id="s339">The reason we knew the Sister so well is that my grandfather supplied them during World War I with meat for the hospital, which was hard to come by, to feed the Sisters.</span> <span id="s340">They had a cloistered order there, and they ran a hospital.</span> <span id="s341">And so they were very kind to us.</span> <span id="s342">They let us in, and they gave us shelter.</span> <span id="s343">And we joined my grandparents, and told them in guarded terms what had happened to the house.</span> <span id="s344">Early in the morning Mother Superior came in crying and she said, "I can't keep you.</span> <span id="s345">I can and I can't."</span> <span id="s346">She said, "The Gestapo was here.</span> <span id="s347">They know you're here.</span> <span id="s348">They said if I harbor you there will be no food supplies to my hospital, to my indigent, to my sick, and to my cloistered order.</span> <span id="s349">But I will do it if you want to stay."</span> <span id="s350">And we said, "No, we can't let that happen to you."</span> <span id="s351">So, she said, "I have another plan.</span> <span id="s352">I will give you clothing, and I'll put a veil over your head, and I'll dress you up, and you can go to the closest biggest town."</span> <span id="s353">Which is what we did.</span> <span id="s354">In our town we could never have remained anonymous, but in a larger town you could.</span> <span id="s355">I did not look Jewish.</span> <span id="s356">I had blue eyes.</span> <span id="s357">I had blonde hair.</span> <span id="s358">My mother looked French.</span> <span id="s359">She had spanking black hair, and a turned up nose.</span> <span id="s360">There was no way we would have been sighted as looking Jewish.</span> <span id="s361">So we went to a town called Bielefeld, which was a major town.</span> <span id="s362">It's spelled B-I-E-L-E-F-E-L-D.</span> <span id="s363">It was a lovely town.</span> <span id="s364">It had about 80,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.</span> <span id="s365">It was a place we went to for theater and for culture.</span> <span id="s366">It was our New York.</span> <span id="s367">And we had friends there.</span> <span id="s368">And we were not known.</span> <span id="s369">So, Mother Superior gave us money and some food.</span> <span id="s370">And, it was only a half hour by train.</span> <span id="s371">We had friends there who, Jewish friends, and we went to their home.</span> <span id="s372">There only the depart ment stores were burned, and the synagogue, but not a personal home.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s374">ET: We arrived in Bielefeld, a very beautiful town nestled in surrounding moun tains, an exquisite little town.</span> <span id="s375">No, not town, big town.</span> <span id="s376">And we went to our friends who gave us shelter.</span> <span id="s377">They were Jewish, good friends who we had known a long time.</span> <span id="s378">And people began to give us some clothing.</span> <span id="s379">We did find out that all the men had been rounded up everywhere in Germany, anyone over 16, and taken to three different sites of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s380">The one designated for our area was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s381">Now Buchenwald at that time was not an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s382">It was a camp for people who were politically opposed to Hitler, to homosexuals, to dissidents, to Gypsies, and so on.</span> <span id="s383">And they were simply confined there.</span> <span id="s384">But they had not started the killing process, as I'm sure you know, until the early to middle forties.</span> <span id="s385">So it was an internment concentration camp, and all the men had been rounded up.</span> <span id="s386">And we did find out that my father, too, had gone there, with all the men from that particular region.</span> <span id="s387">So we remained living with friends there for about a month.</span> <span id="s388">And I was taken care of very sweetly by a lot of wonderful Jewish people.</span> <span id="s389">Because what had happened to us was singular.</span> <span id="s390">None of them had their houses burnt.</span> <span id="s391">And having researched this later, it was very rare.</span> <span id="s392">Why in my town, I don't know.</span> <span id="s393">Another house was burnt in my town, and it, too, was an old, magnificent structure.</span> <span id="s394">It had served as a city hall 300 years before it was burnt.</span> <span id="s395">My hus-, I'm probably digressing but as I think of it, when my husband went back to Germany with me in 1985, he looked around and he said, "I can see why they hated you, and hated what you owned.</span> <span id="s396">This area is so beautiful where you lived, and the other area where the other Jewish house was burned was exquisite."</span> <span id="s397">He said, "I think it was jealousy that you owned that, and that you lived in such a little garden spot of the town."</span> <span id="s398">But coming back to the fact that we were singular in having had a house burnt, we did live in Bielefeld for one month.</span> <span id="s399">My mother was slowly wasting away, because my father was at that time gone for one month.</span> <span id="s400">And then the HIAS, a Hebrew International...</span></p> <p><span id="s401">NP: Aid Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">ET: Aid Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">NP: Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">ET: We called it HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">NP: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">ET: Rounded all of us up, and the local chapter was in Bielefeld where we were then living.</span> <span id="s407">And they told us that we could go back to our hometown, that two houses were designated as Jew houses.</span> <span id="s408">And that's what it was known as, Judenhaus, Jew House.</span> <span id="s409">And so we went back and there were two houses that had belonged to Jewish merchants that were given to us.</span> <span id="s410">The Jews who had lived there had, one had escaped to Holland and consequently the Germans found him in Holland then sent him to his death later on.</span> <span id="s411">The other was by a former merchant who had emigrated to the U.S. and it was still available.</span> <span id="s412">They were stone structures, and they obviously couldn't burn them.</span> <span id="s413">They had destroyed the inside, but they had not been able to burn them.</span> <span id="s414">So, we were given a house and...we stayed in that house from 1939, January, until we left, August, 1941.</span> <span id="s415">And I lived as the only Jewish child.</span> <span id="s416">It seemed that right after Crystal Night a lot of the people in the town were able to go to Australia, Chile, Argentina, and so on.</span> <span id="s417">And we had a visa pending with the Consulate, the American Consulate.</span> <span id="s418">And our number, our waiting number was so high that it was not called until 1941, which made it, unfortunately, impossible to emigrate.</span> <span id="s419">So, we were stuck in the Jew House.</span> <span id="s420">And they were all older people, and I was the only child.</span> <span id="s421">And I grew up in a very strange world, because having been alone and only being able to relate to adults, was somewhat like the man who wrote Rebel Without a Cause, the psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s422">He also wrote The Jet Propelled Couch.</span> <span id="s423">And I always felt some identity with the people in his book.</span> <span id="s424">I was in an unreal world.</span> <span id="s425">The girls with whom I had gone to school had been forbidden to ever speak to me again.</span> <span id="s426">When I passed them in the street they avoided my glance.</span> <span id="s427">No one spoke to me.</span> <span id="s428">And so, at that point I was being educated in the Jew House by quite a few elderly people.</span> <span id="s429">And it's funny, everyone perceives education to be, one man decided that if I did not learn Roman numerals I'd never go on in life.</span> <span id="s430">So I learned that.</span> <span id="s431">My grandmother taught me geography.</span> <span id="s432">One little old lady taught me how to cook and bake.</span> <span id="s433">Someone taught me how to crochet and knit.</span> <span id="s434">My father thought I could never go on unless I learned Shiller and Goethe and some very fine, still quote "German literature."</span></p> <p><span id="s435">NP: So he had been released.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">ET: Yes, oh, I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">NP: That's O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">ET: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">NP: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">ET: All the Jewish men, if they had not died in the camps, were to be released within six to eight weeks.</span> <span id="s441">My father was released after six weeks, because he was the proud owner of a, an Iron Cross First Class.</span> <span id="s442">And Goering, at the time, decreed that, if you had been heavily wounded and had been an outstanding war hero you could get out earlier.</span> <span id="s443">That meant my father was able to crawl through the wired juiced up fences of Buchenwald, and take a chance of getting electrocuted or watching whether he was going to miss that precious little moment.</span> <span id="s444">He did make it.</span> <span id="s445">He was a very strong man, emotionally and physically.</span> <span id="s446">He was very unusual.</span> <span id="s447">He was an up man, too.</span> <span id="s448">His spirit was always up.</span> <span id="s449">He did, he was told he could go.</span> <span id="s450">He was still in his original night shirt, and the coat which I had given him.</span> <span id="s451">He had lost about 45 pounds.</span> <span id="s452">Tales that he had told us of Buchenwald later were rather awful, but he survived it.</span> <span id="s453">He ran through the woods of Thuringia, which is a..</span> <span id="s454">.</span> <span id="s455">[unclear], a..</span> <span id="s456">.</span> <span id="s457">province.</span> <span id="s458">And very, very cold.</span> <span id="s459">It's extremely cold up there.</span> <span id="s460">It's near Weimar, and it's a very, very cold area.</span> <span id="s461">He made it through the woods, and he said there were people peering out through their windows.</span> <span id="s462">And he said, "If ever you think they did not know what was going on," he said, "the screams of some of the people, and the escap ing prisoners coming out such as I, you had to know."</span> <span id="s463">He hit Weimar, which is of course as you know, a major city.</span> <span id="s464">And he made it, there were people who whispered little things to him again—it was HIAS who was present under cover—and said, "Go to the railway station and we'll take care of you."</span> <span id="s465">And there was a, an underground concourse, as I re mem ber his tale.</span> <span id="s466">It's been a long time.</span> <span id="s467">And there were S.S. men standing there with clubs, clubbing all those who would come out to try one more time.</span> <span id="s468">And he dodged through.</span> <span id="s469">He was not hit too badly.</span> <span id="s470">And he was sort of shown by HIAS by a little wave of the hand which train to take.</span> <span id="s471">And they quietly gave him a little broth, just to sip through his mouth.</span> <span id="s472">It was one of the few nourishments he had had.</span> <span id="s473">He did make it home.</span> <span id="s474">One man from our town had died there, in, within a four week span.</span> <span id="s475">Another one came home, he was never the same.</span> <span id="s476">He died soon afterwards.</span> <span id="s477">My father was strong.</span> <span id="s478">He got out, he came out.</span> <span id="s479">He came home one night in January to the Jew House.</span> <span id="s480">I did not recognize him.</span> <span id="s481">He had a big, black beard.</span> <span id="s482">He'd lost about 45 pounds.</span> <span id="s483">But he smiled, and my mother collapsed upon him.</span> <span id="s484">And during that night I heard screaming.</span> <span id="s485">He was delirious.</span> <span id="s486">He had pneumonia.</span> <span id="s487">And without antibiotics, without any attending he got through it very nicely.</span> <span id="s488">And, he told about his experience there, and how they let them live in, there were layers of five slabs of wood, five high, five across.</span> <span id="s489">They slept there in the...dirt.</span> <span id="s490">And it was just like the concentration camps that you have seen later on, but they were just internment camps at that time.</span> <span id="s491">But they...gave them whale fish soup, with high salt content, and it made them very, very thirsty.</span> <span id="s492">And then they denied water to them.</span> <span id="s493">So they stood in the rain and they opened their mouths, and they had a "public toilet," which was a hole, with slats of wood across it, which were intermittently juiced with electricity, so that people would fall in.</span> <span id="s494">And these were tales he told us.</span> <span id="s495">And that the dead bodies were thrown to zoo animals there.</span> <span id="s496">And I did hear all this, at a very young age.</span> <span id="s497">And that if you didn't comply with rules, you were put in solitary confinement, which was a slab of concrete in which you were encased, straight up, and you could not move.</span> <span id="s498">And one night the Vienna Choir, I guess young men's choir, it couldn't have been boys, were at, it was actually at Christmas, sang.</span> <span id="s499">And my father said they had to stand outside in the cold and listen.</span> <span id="s500">The voices were exquisitely beautiful, but the songs they were made to sing were dirty ditties about Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">NP: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">ET: And they were very funny, and a lot of the Jews laughed.</span> <span id="s503">And the moment they laughed—they began to howl with laughter—a prison guard came from behind and hit them over the head.</span> <span id="s504">Because this is exactly what they wanted to elicit.</span> <span id="s505">So they put whispers down, "No matter how funny it is, don't laugh."</span> <span id="s506">So those were some of the things he had gone through.</span> <span id="s507">That was just part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">NP: Did...you hear your father talk about the Council of German Jews which was known as the Reichsvertretung?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">ET: The Reichs-...</span></p> <p><span id="s510">NP: R-E-I-C-H-S-V-E-R-T-R-E-T-U-N-G, and it was known as the Council of German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">ET: Yes, all things were talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">ET: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">NP: And the Nuremberg Laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">ET: Oh yes, I knew about them.</span> <span id="s516">Not in depth.</span> <span id="s517">I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">NP: Right.</span> <span id="s519">And the Aryan Paragraph?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">ET: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NP: That was in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">ET: No.</span> <span id="s523">I have read since.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">NP: That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">ET: I was only five then, in '3-, no I had not.</span> <span id="s526">But one senses one doesn't have to know the history.</span> <span id="s527">The history I read afterwards.</span> <span id="s528">I lived through it, but I read later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">NP: How did anyone support themselves at this time in...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">ET: Afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">NP: Eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s532">ET: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NP: After your father came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">ET: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">NP: And he was in the Jew House.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">ET: O.K. Hitler confiscated all Jewish property, monies, belongings, investments, period.</span> <span id="s537">Because "the Jews had to pay for Crystal Night."</span> <span id="s538">I'm not sure how one can equate that, but we had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s539">So, we, and everyone else had nothing.</span> <span id="s540">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s541">We were not alone.</span> <span id="s542">We were then all equalized as nothing.</span> <span id="s543">What happened again, HIAS stepped in.</span> <span id="s544">We had a collective agency for clothing, because we could not buy anything in Germany.</span> <span id="s545">We, (A) we had no money, (B) they were going into rationing.</span> <span id="s546">We had no rationing cards.</span> <span id="s547">So we collected clothing items from each other and we rotated them.</span> <span id="s548">My shoes were stretched so they would last longer.</span> <span id="s549">Old clothing was made over for young clothing.</span> <span id="s550">Men's suits, for women's suits.</span> <span id="s551">My father was doing forced labor.</span> <span id="s552">He was work-, he was told to work in Bielefeld again, and this is now our concourse, our cen tralized place to be.</span> <span id="s553">He became a worker in a cement factory.</span> <span id="s554">He got up at five in the morning to take a six o'clock train to go to the town of Bielefeld, where he made cement blocks.</span> <span id="s555">He was at that time, '39, 46, -7 years old.</span> <span id="s556">He was doing very heavy labor.</span> <span id="s557">Then when that was finished they put him into a—this is the German, this is not the HIAS, this is the German authorities—he was making cigars and cigar bags in a factory.</span> <span id="s558">And he got paid minimally, nothing.</span> <span id="s559">If it hadn't been for HIAS, and Jews helping them selves out, I don't know how we would have really lived.</span> <span id="s560">There were always a few good Germans in my town who helped.</span> <span id="s561">There always are, everywhere, and they were definitely.</span> <span id="s562">They brought food at night and left it at our doorstep.</span> <span id="s563">There was one very courageous couple who didn't care what anyone said about them, a German couple who would have us over to dinner.</span> <span id="s564">And consequently, after my parents and I left, and I'm jumping ahead, but this particular couple took my grandmother, who had to be left in Ger many, and put her on the boxcar, to send her to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s565">They had the courage, the grace, and the humanity, to take this woman between themselves and kiss her and walk her up.</span> <span id="s566">They were in grave danger of being killed.</span> <span id="s567">They did it anyway.</span> <span id="s568">Many years later my son, as a twenty-year-old, with his fianceé , visited them, in gratitude and with love.</span> <span id="s569">They were pure people, which was very unusual.</span> <span id="s570">And they did give us sustenance in the Jew House.</span> <span id="s571">I don't really know how we lived.</span> <span id="s572">There wasn't much, as, I don't...</span></p> <p><span id="s573">NP: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s574">ET: Is...</span></p> <p><span id="s575">NP: They took your grandmother...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">ET: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s577">NP: To [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s578">ET: No, the assembling place for the remaining Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">NP: After you...left.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">ET: This is after we left, and I think this was the earlier part of 1942, all were exterminated in the camps.</span> <span id="s581">We were the only people who got out of the Jew House—my parents and I.</span> <span id="s582">In both Jews Houses the people who inhabited these houses all died in the camps, including my grandmother.</span> <span id="s583">And, they were rounded up at different times and told to come to the railway station, where the cattle is.</span> <span id="s584">Not where people go, but where cattle is put in—a very familiar site to us because we were in that business, and always watching for cattle to disembark twenty or forty heads, and this is eventually where my grandmother went, into a cattle car.</span> <span id="s585">And she did not know her destination.</span> <span id="s586">It's a good thing she did at that point not know it.</span> <span id="s587">But they knew she had to go there, this couple, and they walked her there, right through the streets.</span> <span id="s588">These are acts of courage that you hear about once in a while, as you know in France and in Belgium, they happened everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">NP: Very Righteous Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">ET: Oh very much.</span> <span id="s591">They were just pure, godly people.</span> <span id="s592">That's it.</span> <span id="s593">And there were a few farmers who left food at our doorstep.</span> <span id="s594">There was a wonderful doctor, who bought the Jew House we were in, so that we wouldn't have to worry, and we lived free.</span> <span id="s595">He was our doctor.</span> <span id="s596">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s597">There were some, there was a delicatessen which, when we would go with our little stamps, rationing stamps, they were marked "Jew."</span> <span id="s598">We got very little of anything.</span> <span id="s599">They always threw something in the bottom of the bag for us.</span> <span id="s600">There were some good people.</span> <span id="s601">But they were in such a minority.</span> <span id="s602">So then my life in the Jew House took a different turn.</span> <span id="s603">For the first three months, and then my father's...eventual return, we settled into some order.</span> <span id="s604">We had one kitchen and we had one bathroom.</span> <span id="s605">We were all assigned rooms.</span> <span id="s606">And we had to cook together.</span> <span id="s607">That's a tough thing to do.</span> <span id="s608">We managed it, and on top of it, HIAS called us and said that the Baltic Sea coast was being freed of Jews because Jews could have possibly have some power as spies.</span> <span id="s609">And we had to incorporate those people into our houses.</span> <span id="s610">We had very little room.</span> <span id="s611">So we inherited a couple from the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s612">And they were put into the Jew House, into the one remaining room that we used as a community living room.</span> <span id="s613">So now we no longer had a living room.</span> <span id="s614">We only had our bedrooms.</span> <span id="s615">Somewhere in 1939, about three or four months after Crystal Night, the Rabbi in Bielefeld, again the central town for us for all activity, started, a school for the remaining children of the entire area.</span> <span id="s616">A brave young man he was.</span> <span id="s617">He took an old storefront that had belonged to a Jewish family and he made a school for us, eight grades.</span> <span id="s618">He had a wonderful idea what he thought should be taught.</span> <span id="s619">It was all his idea.</span> <span id="s620">And, first of all, the older children had to teach the younger children, so I, being 11, was sort of in the middle but I took the six-year-olds.</span> <span id="s621">He taught us Hebrew again, very severely so, and the Sephardic Hebrew, too.</span> <span id="s622">He taught us Heine, the poet, some math, wonderful writing samples.</span> <span id="s623">It was very important.</span> <span id="s624">And then he took us into a little corner, and he attempted to do some gym with us.</span> <span id="s625">When I think of it now it's really funny, but he was great.</span> <span id="s626">He did a wonderful job with us.</span> <span id="s627">And when I finally arrived here in 1941 and I started school in October, I would honestly say I missed three years of school.</span> <span id="s628">But I had some very eclectic learning in my brain [chuckles].</span> <span id="s629">Many people had put forth some great thinking, and thoughts.</span> <span id="s630">And I lived by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">NP: Excuse me, did you, there was, you knew that you were coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s632">There was no other destination ever considered?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">ET: You say I knew.</span> <span id="s634">I hoped.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">NP: You hoped.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">ET: I lived for that hope.</span> <span id="s637">We had gotten a registration number in Stuttgart, which was the regional American Consulate for our area, in 1938, in August, when Germany, Czechoslovakia and the world was on fire.</span> <span id="s638">My father said, "I think we better get a waiting number."</span> <span id="s639">And I remember our number.</span> <span id="s640">It was 16,527.</span> <span id="s641">The people who got out in March of '39, their number was 5,000 and 6,000.</span> <span id="s642">So that will give you an idea.</span> <span id="s643">And I still face tiously thank our President Roosevelt for not enlarging the quota, and I would like to say to him if he could hear me, "You cost me three terrible years."</span> <span id="s644">If he had enlarged the quota the way we had done later for Hungary, for Vietnam, and for Cuba, I would have been out of there sooner.</span> <span id="s645">But we had to wait for that number to be called.</span> <span id="s646">This had nothing to do with Germany.</span> <span id="s647">This was purely the U.S. Immigration.</span> <span id="s648">It had to do with that.</span> <span id="s649">You could go to what was called a transit country, somewhere else, and wait out your number.</span> <span id="s650">Your number would always be a German number, a German waiting number.</span> <span id="s651">No matter where you went, you were under the German quota.</span> <span id="s652">We had relatives in Haiti, and my father wrote to them, "Could you get us to Haiti?"</span> <span id="s653">We had a cousin in the United States who was well monied.</span> <span id="s654">He'd left Germany in '28.</span> <span id="s655">He was a banker.</span> <span id="s656">He must have foreseen things that no one else foresaw.</span> <span id="s657">He left Europe in '33 and settled in the U.S.</span> <span id="s658">He was one of the few clairvoyants, I would say.</span> <span id="s659">We approached him.</span> <span id="s660">He needed to send money to Haiti for us to go there.</span> <span id="s661">He sent money to Haiti.</span> <span id="s662">We had passage on a ship.</span> <span id="s663">This was '39, in May.</span> <span id="s664">And then we got the glad "news" that the Haitian government had taken the money and had a big party with it, and had a drinking party.</span> <span id="s665">There was no more money, and there was no more passage.</span> <span id="s666">A propos, not much has changed in Haiti till now, has it?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">NP: Are they still there in Haiti?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">ET: They're dead, but their children are living here now.</span> <span id="s669">Their daughters are a bit younger than I. I am, I'll be 66 and their daughters are probably in their 50s.</span> <span id="s670">And there's no one there any more.</span> <span id="s671">They made a literal fortune there, in the mahogany industry, Sisal and Mahogany.</span> <span id="s672">So, no Haiti.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">NP: Were there relatives that remained, other than your grandmother, in your town, or, I mean, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">ET: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s675">I have given a rough count.</span> <span id="s676">That I know of, about 45 of my relatives died in the camps.</span> <span id="s677">But there are only a few who count, and the only one who will ever count is my grandmother.</span> <span id="s678">I'll never get over it, ever.</span> <span id="s679">She raised me.</span> <span id="s680">She was more, my mother was a very bright, intelligent, vivacious woman, but my grandmother, actually it was her mother-in-law, was my sustaining force in life.</span> <span id="s681">She was my security.</span> <span id="s682">She was my everything.</span> <span id="s683">She was bright.</span> <span id="s684">She was tri-lingual.</span> <span id="s685">She spoke English, French, and Ger man.</span> <span id="s686">Her English was just fair, but she could write it.</span> <span id="s687">Her French was fluent.</span> <span id="s688">She was my mentor.</span> <span id="s689">She was unusual.</span> <span id="s690">She was strong.</span> <span id="s691">She was bright.</span> <span id="s692">She could not come over be cause we would never have been able to get a visa.</span> <span id="s693">She was too old.</span> <span id="s694">This country looks at people, looked at people then, as a possible burden to the State.</span> <span id="s695">We had just here come out of a Depression, and that was understandable in that sense.</span> <span id="s696">But she would never have been got, able to have gotten a visa, so she was never on the application.</span> <span id="s697">I think we closed our eyes to the fact, not I, I think my father had to, that he knew that she would have to be left one day.</span> <span id="s698">And I have often resented that in my father, until I spoke with my son.</span> <span id="s699">He is 42 now.</span> <span id="s700">He has two children.</span> <span id="s701">He said, "What do you think I would have to do one day?</span> <span id="s702">Would I not have to leave you as much as I love you?</span> <span id="s703">For the sake of the children.</span> <span id="s704">And the children come first."</span> <span id="s705">I understand that.</span> <span id="s706">But, I can never make my peace with it.</span> <span id="s707">So, any way, we did not go.</span> <span id="s708">I'm probably jumping the gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">NP: That's all right.</span> <span id="s710">That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">ET: We did not go to Haiti.</span> <span id="s712">We knew then that this was it, and we hoped and hoped and hoped our number would soon be called.</span> <span id="s713">We hoped.</span> <span id="s714">The points of exit in Ger many were lessening, as Hitler rampaged his way, or ravaged his way through Europe.</span> <span id="s715">Every country fell, all the Scandanavians, the Netherlands, Poland, and in the end, France.</span> <span id="s716">So the ports of exit in Germany and all Europe were closed.</span> <span id="s717">We were still not getting any news from the, Stuttgart as to when we would be called.</span> <span id="s718">In January of 1941, after having been in the Jew House for two years, we got a letter from the Consulate.</span> <span id="s719">"You are to ap pear April 21st for your visa, for examination for the visa."</span> <span id="s720">HIAS got us the train tickets.</span> <span id="s721">It was a far trip.</span> <span id="s722">It's a, Stuttgart is in the south of Germany.</span> <span id="s723">We went, and we were treated by the American Consulate very much like the Germans treated us.</span> <span id="s724">I think they had learned German ways already.</span> <span id="s725">I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s726">They were mass processing us.</span> <span id="s727">They took 49 fingerprints of me at the age of 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">NP: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">ET: What criminal I could have been at that time I have no idea.</span> <span id="s730">We were given a sheet of paper, how to behave for the day.</span> <span id="s731">We would be there the whole day.</span> <span id="s732">We were examined by a doctor.</span> <span id="s733">I was 13 and some.</span> <span id="s734">I was menstruating the second time in my life, and I had to walk naked in front of this doctor.</span> <span id="s735">The indignancies [indignities?]</span> <span id="s736">of life.</span> <span id="s737">So did my mother.</span> <span id="s738">And we had to do certain exercises so he could see how well we were —raise our arms and our legs, and walk single file in front of him.</span> <span id="s739">And I think the most comforting thing my mother said to me was, "Ellen, pretend he is not there.</span> <span id="s740">Just walk.</span> <span id="s741">We may get out of this country."</span> <span id="s742">And so I did.</span> <span id="s743">It's a very tender age, at 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">NP: Oh indeed it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">ET: To be young, and also to be in flux at the time.</span> <span id="s746">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s747">I didn't like the man.</span> <span id="s748">He was very military.</span> <span id="s749">He barked at me in German what I should be doing, lifting my arms.</span> <span id="s750">But I took my mother's advice.</span> <span id="s751">I thought of better things.</span> <span id="s752">And then we got dressed and there were...at least 50 people who had been called up that day.</span> <span id="s753">And then we were called to the Consul's office.</span> <span id="s754">He was a young man, and I think today I would say he was about 40, a handsome dark man, with a little moustache.</span> <span id="s755">And he looked at me, and he said, "Are you well?"</span> <span id="s756">And I said, "I think so."</span> <span id="s757">I wasn't sure how to answer him.</span> <span id="s758">And he said to my parents, "Are you aware that your daughter has a heart murmur and she may not be able to get a visa?"</span> <span id="s759">My mother at that point was just about to slip under her chair.</span> <span id="s760">And my father had a fantastic command of the German language.</span> <span id="s761">He was very bright.</span> <span id="s762">Instead of saying, "She doesn't," he said, "To the best of my knowledge I am not aware of it."</span> <span id="s763">He didn't want to offend the possible new country's emissary.</span> <span id="s764">And, the Consul looked at us, and he said, "I will have her x-rayed.</span> <span id="s765">And I will see what happens.</span> <span id="s766">But if she doesn't pass it, she will stay here, and you may go."</span> <span id="s767">My mother was not to be dealt with at that point at all.</span> <span id="s768">She was almost comatose again.</span> <span id="s769">We did go in for an x-ray.</span> <span id="s770">And we were told it was a lung x-ray.</span> <span id="s771">We came back and at this point we were I think-</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s773">NP: ...an interview with Ellen Tarlow, on 11-19-93.</span> <span id="s774">We can begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">ET: O.K. Back in the Consul's office, he informed us that, although he detected a heart murmur, I seemed to be otherwise in good health and that we could indeed get a visa.</span> <span id="s776">The relief was incredible.</span> <span id="s777">We finally had this tiny little stamp on our passport, and it said, "This visa is good until September 22nd, 1941."</span> <span id="s778">And so there we were.</span> <span id="s779">We had what we wanted.</span> <span id="s780">We didn't even, I didn't even think of my grandmother at that point.</span> <span id="s781">I was just so happy.</span> <span id="s782">I could not believe I had this.</span> <span id="s783">So, back we went to "The Jew House."</span> <span id="s784">And there was always that little envy there.</span> <span id="s785">I could sense it.</span> <span id="s786">"You have a visa.</span> <span id="s787">We have noth ing."</span> <span id="s788">Both Jew Houses were full of people who had nothing, who had no quota number, who had no way of getting out.</span> <span id="s789">Did we suspect more at the time?</span> <span id="s790">I think within us we probably did.</span> <span id="s791">We had been reduced to nothing, and how much worse it could get?</span> <span id="s792">I don't know that we knew, that we saw it, that we envisioned.</span> <span id="s793">I think my mother always envis ioned something horrible.</span> <span id="s794">Anyway, now the task was to get passage.</span> <span id="s795">At that time the only harbor still open, one was Lisbon, and one was Yokohama.</span> <span id="s796">And Germany was already, no, Ger many was going to be at war with Russia in 1940, I believe?</span> <span id="s797">If I get my facts straight.</span> <span id="s798">I think it was.</span> <span id="s799">Anyway, those were the two exit harbors.</span> <span id="s800">So then again HIAS, which is the only organization that could ever work for us, tried to obtain passage.</span> <span id="s801">And we tried to get money from our relatives to pay for this enormous amount of money to make up for that.</span> <span id="s802">It was just highway robbery.</span> <span id="s803">All these countries were, [sighs] oh, using us and extort ing money to get us, you know, passage.</span> <span id="s804">It took forever and ever and ever, because it was very hard to get passage.</span> <span id="s805">Now that we finally had the visa, we didn't know if we'd be able to use it.</span> <span id="s806">And I do remember going back to our little school in Bielefeld, and a man com ing, a Jewish man coming up to me at recess and he said to me, "You'll never get out.</span> <span id="s807">You may have a visa.</span> <span id="s808">You're gonna be stuck here with the rest of us.</span> <span id="s809">You won't get passage."</span> <span id="s810">And I remember a terror flooding right through me, because that was all I lived for, that we had the visa.</span> <span id="s811">Well, somehow somewhere, we were told that we could get out through Portugal, and that my father's cousin in New York was paying, and HIAS, and everyone combined and so on.</span> <span id="s812">It was I think $1,000 a person then.</span> <span id="s813">And so Octo ber, no, excuse me, August the 5th or 6th we embarked on the greatest journey of our lives.</span> <span id="s814">We were told we had to assemble in Berlin, and we would go in a sealed train to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s815">I will explain the sealing later.</span> <span id="s816">We had to provide food for the train for ourselves for five days.</span> <span id="s817">There would be no refrigeration.</span> <span id="s818">So my...parents prepared boiled eggs and bread and some pickled meat and odd things in a thermos.</span> <span id="s819">And early on an August day, at five or six in the morning, my grandmother walked us to the train.</span> <span id="s820">It was the longest walk I ever took and I ever will take.</span> <span id="s821">She was 77, I think, or 78.</span> <span id="s822">She took us to the train.</span> <span id="s823">She always wore black.</span> <span id="s824">She had a little hat on with a little veil.</span> <span id="s825">She was my father's mother.</span> <span id="s826">She stood on the platform, and the train approached.</span> <span id="s827">We had a bag each to carry.</span> <span id="s828">We could only take out that which we were able to carry, and I was very skinny, and very undernourished.</span> <span id="s829">I weighed 78 pounds.</span> <span id="s830">I was 13-and-three-quarter, and my father carried my bag with the clothing.</span> <span id="s831">It's all we could take, we couldn't, we could take nothing of value.</span> <span id="s832">We had no thing nor could we have taken it.</span> <span id="s833">And she stood, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s834">I called her Oma, which is German for Nanny.</span> <span id="s835">And, she did not cry.</span> <span id="s836">I don't know how the woman did it.</span> <span id="s837">I've talked about this, choking with tears.</span> <span id="s838">I've talked about as if I were a commentator and Connie Chung herself per haps, and right now I feel like Connie Chung.</span> <span id="s839">I'm looking on.</span> <span id="s840">She stood there, and she put her arms around me and she said one final thing.</span> <span id="s841">She said, "Do well."</span> <span id="s842">I think it was as if she pronounced me for life, that I should do well.</span> <span id="s843">Because it echoed in my soul forever.</span> <span id="s844">She hugged us.</span> <span id="s845">She did not cry.</span> <span id="s846">If she did I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s847">I looked out the window until she was a little black dot.</span> <span id="s848">It was the most horrible thing in my life.</span> <span id="s849">She stayed.</span> <span id="s850">We went on to Berlin.</span> <span id="s851">We [unclear] I'd never seen Berlin.</span> <span id="s852">My father took me around.</span> <span id="s853">There were constant air raids.</span> <span id="s854">And, we did get out at night to the railway sta tion in Berlin.</span> <span id="s855">It was a subterranean kind of a through-walk.</span> <span id="s856">And the sirens were sound ing, because 1941, the British were heavily, heavily bombing Germany.</span> <span id="s857">And that was our farewell, a last air raid.</span> <span id="s858">And we were put on a two-compartment sealed train, with Gestapo escorts, because we were going through France.</span> <span id="s859">France was occupied by Germany.</span> <span id="s860">We could have been spies.</span> <span id="s861">And, the train was sealed.</span> <span id="s862">I don't know how it was sealed, but it was sealed.</span> <span id="s863">We had two toilets for 64 people.</span> <span id="s864">We sat straight up and they were not the upholstered first or second class compartments; they were wood.</span> <span id="s865">And we stayed on that for five days.</span> <span id="s866">Well, actually we were let out in Spain, so I shouldn't say that, but all the way through France we sat.</span> <span id="s867">In Paris they were, we stopped and HIAS again came with hot tea and hot coffee and the Ges ta po came.</span> <span id="s868">We had two Gestapo men on each of the train compartments.</span> <span id="s869">Not compartments, I mean the whole train section.</span> <span id="s870">And he opened the windows with a key and the hot liquids were brought in to us.</span> <span id="s871">This is the only liquid we had since Germany.</span> <span id="s872">And then the two toilets, systems were made—children first, wo men, and so on.</span> <span id="s873">And I was so skinny that my father laid me in the baggage net on top, where the baggage goes.</span> <span id="s874">We didn't have much baggage anyway, and we were all in the same boat.</span> <span id="s875">So I kind of twisted and turned in there and I laid there.</span> <span id="s876">Everyone else sat.</span> <span id="s877">And then we got into Spain.</span> <span id="s878">The border of France, a little town spelled H-E-N-, I'll say it again.</span> <span id="s879">H-E-N-D-A-Y-E.</span> <span id="s880">The Germans called it Hendaye ["hen-dai"].</span> <span id="s881">My father said, "They don't know their French.</span> <span id="s882">It's Anday [chuckles].</span> <span id="s883">That was our last exam in ation, by Gestapo and border German police, because France, you know, was theirs and a woman was body stripped and body searched...a Jewish lady.</span> <span id="s884">And she was in a hyster ical state.</span> <span id="s885">My mother quietly explained to me what they did to her.</span> <span id="s886">I could not believe what they did to her.</span> <span id="s887">They were looking for jewelry, and some people did smuggle things out.</span> <span id="s888">And, we were questioned one more time, and then we went into Spain.</span> <span id="s889">And Spain in 1941 was at the tail end of a civil war.</span> <span id="s890">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s891">It was burnt, the fields were burnt to a crisp.</span> <span id="s892">They were stubbles of black.</span> <span id="s893">And the children were jumping on our train.</span> <span id="s894">The Gestapo escort had left.</span> <span id="s895">We were, Spain was neutral, for what it was then Spain.</span> <span id="s896">Six-year-olds were jumping in our train window yelling in there.</span> <span id="s897">But they wanted to smoke.</span> <span id="s898">Some one spoke Spanish, and they asked, "Why do you want to smoke?"</span> <span id="s899">And they said, "It kills the hunger."</span> <span id="s900">So we saw there another form of terror.</span> <span id="s901">And then we were let off at a little town called Irun, I-R-U-N, and it was the loveliest experience...</span></p> <p><span id="s902">NP: This is in Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">ET: This was in Spain.</span> <span id="s904">We stayed a night and a day in a little inn.</span> <span id="s905">I had bed bugs in my room.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">NP: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">ET: They were falling on my head.</span> <span id="s908">I didn't know what they were.</span> <span id="s909">[laughs] And I called my father and I said, "Daddy, something's falling on my head!"</span> <span id="s910">And he came in and said, "Oh my," he said, "they're bedbugs.</span> <span id="s911">Put the sheet over your head."</span> <span id="s912">The next morning I thought I was in a scene of Carmen.</span> <span id="s913">It was Sunday, and the bells were pealing, and church was, Mass was beginning.</span> <span id="s914">Little donkeys with women riding on it.</span> <span id="s915">It was incredi ble.</span> <span id="s916">We had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s917">My father knew Latin well, and Spanish, and Greek, so he got along really well everywhere.</span> <span id="s918">And we mingled.</span> <span id="s919">And we had some awful bread we'd gotten out of Germany.</span> <span id="s920">But it was bread, and they had no bread.</span> <span id="s921">Very little of it.</span> <span id="s922">They had lots of fruit, so we got fruit.</span> <span id="s923">So we bar tered a little bit.</span> <span id="s924">And then back on the train and we rode all through Sierra Madre, which was burnt out at that time of year.</span> <span id="s925">It was kind of...I don't know whether it was burnt out.</span> <span id="s926">It looked yellow; I remember it.</span> <span id="s927">Everything was yellow ochre and mulberry trees and there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s928">And we just went through and through and through.</span> <span id="s929">And all these little kids kept jumping on our train asking for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s930">And then we arrived in Portugal.</span> <span id="s931">Not in Lisbon, but at the other end of this long, narrow strip of Portugal, I guess.</span> <span id="s932">It sort of ensconces that part of the world there.</span> <span id="s933">It's at the left end of Spain, it is a long strip and that's Portugal.</span> <span id="s934">And we were let out in a little town at night called Pampelhosia.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">NP: Yes, would you know how to spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">ET: I think so.</span> <span id="s937">P-A-M-P-E-L-H-O-S-I-A.</span> <span id="s938">I located that.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">NP: It's in Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">ET: Portugal.</span> <span id="s941">And, we were told that we were going to get a real meal.</span> <span id="s942">And out, and under the stars at night, a little old lady came.</span> <span id="s943">And she had no teeth.</span> <span id="s944">She was dressed in black.</span> <span id="s945">And some other ladies came and put a table up outside, outside the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s946">And there was a meal.</span> <span id="s947">And someone came and played music, and we were dancing.</span> <span id="s948">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s949">It was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s950">And back on the train and the next morning we arrived in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s951">So it was a five- or six-day trip.</span> <span id="s952">And, Lisbon was breathtaking.</span> <span id="s953">It's a beau ti ful climate.</span> <span id="s954">It's a magnificent city.</span> <span id="s955">And my father being so aware of the arts im mediately said, "Look at the architecture!</span> <span id="s956">Look at the sculptures!</span> <span id="s957">Look at the ma-, look at this, and look at that.</span> <span id="s958">Look at the fountains!</span> <span id="s959">Look at the streets!</span> <span id="s960">Look at the sky!"</span> <span id="s961">He was always educating me wherever he was.</span> <span id="s962">And it was magnificent.</span> <span id="s963">We were put up in a huge old brownstone house.</span> <span id="s964">Communal living again.</span> <span id="s965">I had so much communal living that [chuckles] I've said to my husband very often that, "I don't mind being poor, but I always want to have my own bathroom [laughs] and my own bedroom."</span> <span id="s966">So there we were, communal living, in a big, big three-story house.</span> <span id="s967">We ate in one room.</span> <span id="s968">We had food provi ded.</span> <span id="s969">And we lived in Lisbon for two weeks, waiting for the boat to be ready.</span> <span id="s970">It was a lovely, lovely time.</span> <span id="s971">We had four dollars each, twelve dollars total, and we got Portuguese money, and my mother got coffee, which she hadn't had in years, and she inhaled it.</span> <span id="s972">And I got milk, which I hadn't had.</span> <span id="s973">So we kind of like floundered around and then again HIAS was there.</span> <span id="s974">And they said, "Would you like to go on a trip?"</span> <span id="s975">And they took us to some of those marvelous islands off the coast of Lisbon.</span> <span id="s976">And it was extraordinary.</span> <span id="s977">And while we were there we saw, I think half of Europe, its spies and its espionage system running around.</span> <span id="s978">Ex-Nazis and ex-thises and that.</span> <span id="s979">Just like the Humphrey Bogart movie.</span> <span id="s980">That's what life was in a neutral city.</span> <span id="s981">And then finally we were told that we could board the ship.</span> <span id="s982">It was the 22nd of Sep-, of August.</span> <span id="s983">And, I made a mistake before.</span> <span id="s984">The visa was good from April to August, not September.</span> <span id="s985">The visa ran out the night we boarded the ship.</span> <span id="s986">If we were not in international waters, I think it's three miles, I'm not sure, something like that, we could have been taken off that ship.</span> <span id="s987">We took off at 9:00 at night, and by 12:00 my father said, "We're finally safe."</span> <span id="s988">Our visa ran out.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">NP: Do you remember the name of the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">ET: Oh, I certainly do.</span> <span id="s991">The Germans called it Musinio, but it's really Mouzin ho.</span> <span id="s992">It was spelled M-O-U-Z-I-N-H-O.</span> <span id="s993">But there is some kind of an accent circumflex somewhere.</span> <span id="s994">And, it could be over the H or the N or, I'm not, I don't know Portuguese, but that was the name of the boat.</span> <span id="s995">It was an ancient boat.</span> <span id="s996">It had been an Italian boat built in the early part of the century, given to some other country as war settlement from World War I.</span> <span id="s997">It had been around.</span> <span id="s998">It was meant to house 350 people.</span> <span id="s999">It took on 750.</span> <span id="s1000">Because, the company which owned the boat—I still remember that name too—the Compania Colonia Navagacio, which means the Colonial Navigation Company—owned that ship, and made lots of money on us, lots of it.</span> <span id="s1001">And we slept tween deck.</span> <span id="s1002">If you don't know what that is, that's how the Irish potato diggers came over.</span> <span id="s1003">It's in the hold of the ship, in the bottom.</span> <span id="s1004">And there are no windows, and there are no [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">NP: How do you spell that?</span> <span id="s1006">Tween deck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">ET: We called it tween deck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">NP: In between.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">ET: In between.</span> <span id="s1010">But it was the hold of the ship.</span> <span id="s1011">And, we were taken down and there were 150 bunks.</span> <span id="s1012">Two high, two across, men, women and children together.</span> <span id="s1013">Six sinks.</span> <span id="s1014">And air hoses to get air down there.</span> <span id="s1015">There was no air.</span> <span id="s1016">So you had to undress, and you had to do your, your everything.</span> <span id="s1017">We had a..</span> <span id="s1018">.</span> <span id="s1019">Russian lady—and we were all Jews, we were all in the same boat—she put up an umbrella and put a sheet over it.</span> <span id="s1020">She was so comical.</span> <span id="s1021">She would go under that sheet with the umbrella, ensconced under it, and she'd come out beautiful.</span> <span id="s1022">She did the whole thing under that.</span> <span id="s1023">And I remember lying next to a man who was constantly seasick and throwing up, and sometimes on my side.</span> <span id="s1024">And with six sinks, O.K., we had a system.</span> <span id="s1025">Due to the fact that [laughing] we were the intelligent si as of Europe we had a system within sixty minutes.</span> <span id="s1026">The climate was lovely.</span> <span id="s1027">The men went atop on deck, and the women washed first.</span> <span id="s1028">Since there wasn't enough water or time, you could wash down to the waist.</span> <span id="s1029">And, then we would go upstairs as women and children, and the men would come down.</span> <span id="s1030">But no shaving allowed, because there wasn't enough water.</span> <span id="s1031">And then the women complained that they had to do a little more personal hygiene once in a while, so we were given once a week extra time for that.</span> <span id="s1032">And we voted that the only luxury cabin available, since everyone had not paid personally but HIAS had paid the same amount of money, was awarded to a young French couple who had a year old and a two-year-old.</span> <span id="s1033">And we gave it to them.</span> <span id="s1034">They were both in diapers.</span> <span id="s1035">I don't know how they managed.</span> <span id="s1036">The food was obnoxious.</span> <span id="s1037">We had everything done in putrid olive oil, and to this day I can't eat olive oil.</span> <span id="s1038">I cannot tolerate it.</span> <span id="s1039">I go to an Italian place and I say, "Leave it out."</span> <span id="s1040">Unless they disguise it really well.</span> <span id="s1041">We lived on oranges and bread, because the food was not edible.</span> <span id="s1042">But the Portuguese who ran the ship were delightful.</span> <span id="s1043">They were very friendly, very sweet.</span> <span id="s1044">And every night we had entertainment.</span> <span id="s1045">We had famous violin ists, sopranos.</span> <span id="s1046">My father loved running fun shows and things.</span> <span id="s1047">He was a very entertaining, bright man.</span> <span id="s1048">So he was the emcee.</span> <span id="s1049">We had fantastic entertainment.</span> <span id="s1050">We were free!</span> <span id="s1051">It was a freedom boat.</span> <span id="s1052">It took two weeks.</span> <span id="s1053">Two weeks, and we went across the Amazons and then we...had a Bri t ish convoy, which seemed to follow us for a long time.</span> <span id="s1054">We were told later that the Germans often knew that they were refugee boats, and thought nothing of shelling them.</span> <span id="s1055">And we felt very secure with this long British convoy line running along.</span> <span id="s1056">The weather was magnificent.</span> <span id="s1057">So the whole trip took a month.</span> <span id="s1058">And we arrived on Labor Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">NP: Where did you arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">ET: [chuckles] Well, we arrived at Staten Island.</span> <span id="s1061">At the time I was told that Ellis Island was closed because it was Labor Day.</span> <span id="s1062">And I believed that, but I have since found out that it may not all have been that, because I think the Coast Guard took it over.</span> <span id="s1063">So whatever it was, it was Staten Island.</span> <span id="s1064">But the setup was exactly the way Ellis Island went, disembarking.</span> <span id="s1065">And there was the examiner at the table.</span> <span id="s1066">And when I, I took a picture of Ellis Island, which we visited.</span> <span id="s1067">And I made a little girl's face with the table that they had standing there, pretending I was checking in.</span> <span id="s1068">And they spoke German.</span> <span id="s1069">Of course they had to be so multi-lingual.</span> <span id="s1070">And one of the first things he asked me, he said, "Have you ever had your lungs removed?"</span> <span id="s1071">[chuckling] And my father said, "Do you think he might not know the word for tonsils?"</span> <span id="s1072">Then he said, "I think I made a mistake."</span> <span id="s1073">They were very sweet.</span> <span id="s1074">So they did the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1075">It took a whole day, and we couldn't get off the ship, because of Labor Day, so we sat on top with our little suitcases.</span> <span id="s1076">And it was very, very hot.</span> <span id="s1077">We didn't know that kind of heat.</span> <span id="s1078">We didn't know it existed.</span> <span id="s1079">Because Europe isn't humid, it isn't that hot.</span> <span id="s1080">It was in the 90's and it was very humid.</span> <span id="s1081">And we had our fall clothing on because we were told, "September is September everywhere."</span> <span id="s1082">And we were sitting, we had long stockings and hats, dying.</span> <span id="s1083">And the Portuguese decided since it was a legal holiday here they were not responsible to feed us.</span> <span id="s1084">So, we didn't have food.</span> <span id="s1085">And so some body hitched up some hot dogs to us.</span> <span id="s1086">And finally at night we got off the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">NP: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1088">Excuse me, were there Jewish relief agencies there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">ET: Oh yeah!</span> <span id="s1090">They were everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">NP: They were there in Staten Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">ET: Oh yeah, oh yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1093">And relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">NP: And relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">ET: And HIAS.</span> <span id="s1096">HIAS is a wonderful work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">NP: And ORT?</span> <span id="s1098">Was anyone from ORT?</span> <span id="s1099">Anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">ET: Never heard of it.</span> <span id="s1101">I only knew of HIAS.</span> <span id="s1102">That was all I ever knew.</span> <span id="s1103">If there was something else, I'm sure there was, but that was brought to my attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">NP: So there were relatives to meet you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">ET: Oh there were relatives just standing down there and there were lights and, I will have to backtrack soon, and talk about my last three years in Germany.</span> <span id="s1106">They were spent in air raids.</span> <span id="s1107">I forgot about that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">NP: That's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">ET: And, so here there were lights.</span> <span id="s1110">There was no blackout.</span> <span id="s1111">And it was heavenly.</span> <span id="s1112">And we were taken to the loveliest section of New York, right off Central Park, another brown stone house.</span> <span id="s1113">Communal living, and I..</span> <span id="s1114">.</span> <span id="s1115">don't think I could ever go to camp after [chuckles] all that communal living!</span> <span id="s1116">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1117">It was a brownstone house, donated by someone, right off Central Park.</span> <span id="s1118">And all the women stayed in one part, and all the men in another.</span> <span id="s1119">And then you had to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1120">And we had food and I became very, very ill.</span> <span id="s1121">I had a strep throat, which in 1941 wasn't treated with anything but rest.</span> <span id="s1122">If they had sulphur it was only for the army.</span> <span id="s1123">I didn't get any.</span> <span id="s1124">And I also developed an infectious disease of the mouth because of what had happened on the boat—bad food and so on.</span> <span id="s1125">And they said I'd have to be hospitalized and be isolated.</span> <span id="s1126">And I said, "Don't do that to me.</span> <span id="s1127">I can't even talk English."</span> <span id="s1128">So they said, "O.K., you can take a little room upstairs and stay there for two weeks."</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">NP: You were quarantined?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">ET: I was quarantined.</span> <span id="s1131">And, I was really sick.</span> <span id="s1132">I had fever, I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s1133">But, as I came out of the fever I still had to stay in bed, and my father—who was eternally thinking of my education—said, "I found some books in the library in German!</span> <span id="s1134">And you're going to read the Odyssey and the Iliad!"</span> <span id="s1135">So I did.</span> <span id="s1136">And we had a German Jewish doctor who came to visit me, because who could understand English?</span> <span id="s1137">Everyone had learn ed French over there, and some had learned English, but French was the language one learned there.</span> <span id="s1138">So, the doctor came up and he looked at me and said, "Wow," he said, "You're thin."</span> <span id="s1139">He said, "When you get up you tell me what you like to eat and we'll do it for you."</span> <span id="s1140">So the first time I stood up he looked at me and he said, "I knew that you were skinny.</span> <span id="s1141">I didn't know you were that tall with it too!"</span> <span id="s1142">He said, "What do you like?"</span> <span id="s1143">I said, "Candy bars and whipped cream."</span> <span id="s1144">He said, "It's yours!"</span> <span id="s1145">So I lived off that.</span> <span id="s1146">And we lived in New York for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s1147">And it was very nice.</span> <span id="s1148">We were able to see a lot of relatives.</span> <span id="s1149">My father took me to museums.</span> <span id="s1150">And, I got well despite not having antibiotics.</span> <span id="s1151">He did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">NP: He took care of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">ET: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1154">I got well.</span> <span id="s1155">I was skinny and malnourished, all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1156">And then we had relatives in Philadelphia—my mother's cousins—and they insisted we come here.</span> <span id="s1157">And they got a room for us.</span> <span id="s1158">It was communal living again.</span> <span id="s1159">It was a boarding room, boarding house with a room.</span> <span id="s1160">It had a room to sleep in and I had an army cot.</span> <span id="s1161">My parents had a bed.</span> <span id="s1162">And then there was another room that was a kitchen, but it didn't have running water.</span> <span id="s1163">It only had a two burner stove.</span> <span id="s1164">The running water we got from the bathroom next to our little two rooms, and there were boarders who bathed and also got water from there.</span> <span id="s1165">And I re mem ber being repulsed and just the whole thing was disgusting, because people were run ning in and out of bathrooms.</span> <span id="s1166">This was in Strawberry Mansion on Columbia Avenue.</span> <span id="s1167">Do you know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">NP: My grandmother used to live in Strawberry Mansion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">ET: Everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">NP: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">ET: But it was nice once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">NP: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">ET: It was lovely.</span> <span id="s1174">It was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">NP: Everything convenient.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">ET: It was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">NP: We walked to everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">ET: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s1179">Oh yeah, it was great.</span> <span id="s1180">But this, you know, a little room.</span> <span id="s1181">So we lived there for a month.</span> <span id="s1182">My parents went to work in a factory making $16 a week.</span> <span id="s1183">My mother sewed on a machine, because she had learned to sew in finishing school, you see, so that equipped her really well [laughs].</span> <span id="s1184">She learned to work a power machine.</span> <span id="s1185">My father became, swept floors in the same factory and became a shipper.</span> <span id="s1186">And I started school.</span> <span id="s1187">And that was a lovely experience.</span> <span id="s1188">I knew a couple of words of English, "hello, how are you."</span> <span id="s1189">But that didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s1190">And I was put into eighth grade, and I should have been almost in ninth, but they felt it was easier for me, because I didn't know English.</span> <span id="s1191">What they didn't know is that I knew more than they did, even without my edu cation.</span> <span id="s1192">And I did extremely well.</span> <span id="s1193">I started school in October in eighth grade.</span> <span id="s1194">I graduated eighth grade in 1942, in June, within what about ten months?</span> <span id="s1195">And I got into honors classes.</span> <span id="s1196">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1197">I lost my accent.</span> <span id="s1198">I had a very lovely Jewish teacher helped me.</span> <span id="s1199">She made me round out my words, the and why and are.</span> <span id="s1200">[chuckles] And, I did very well.</span> <span id="s1201">And we got a bigger apartment, and I worked summers.</span> <span id="s1202">And I worked weekends.</span> <span id="s1203">We all had to.</span> <span id="s1204">And we did not know what had happened to anybody there, in Germany.</span> <span id="s1205">I got one letter from my grandmother, the last letter before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s1206">When I came here it was September.</span> <span id="s1207">Pearl Harbor happened in December.</span> <span id="s1208">And I might interject here that our boat, other than a boat leaving 4 A.M. that night, was the very last boat out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1209">So I share this great fortune with all the people on the boat—the last out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1210">There was no more.</span> <span id="s1211">The Consulate which gave us our visa in April was closed down in June.</span> <span id="s1212">Had we had a higher number we wouldn't have gotten the, a visa.</span> <span id="s1213">One of the last visas.</span> <span id="s1214">It was the last train out of Berlin, too.</span> <span id="s1215">And, literally the last boat.</span> <span id="s1216">The Navemar was the second boat out that night at four.</span> <span id="s1217">So, about nine hours later than when we left was literally the last.</span> <span id="s1218">I was the last to leave, and I have done nothing but question this since then.</span> <span id="s1219">Why me?</span> <span id="s1220">And I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1221">I don't think there's an answer.</span> <span id="s1222">But there is a survivor's guilt there.</span> <span id="s1223">It is always there.</span> <span id="s1224">Because, the children with whom I played, the children who I left, the people in the Jew House, they all went.</span> <span id="s1225">And I have a book which was sent to me concerning the people in my hometown, as to their ultimate fate.</span> <span id="s1226">It was made up by someone who had emigrated to Israel, and he had gone back to my hometown and searched everything.</span> <span id="s1227">And I have the book and my children have it.</span> <span id="s1228">It's in German.</span> <span id="s1229">I've translated the salient parts for them.</span> <span id="s1230">And it tells what happened to everyone.</span> <span id="s1231">And we had left that August day, and by December they were already taking people.</span> <span id="s1232">They took the couple that came from the Baltic Sea, in December, and sent them to Riga, Poland [Latvia -ed.]</span> <span id="s1233">, to a sure death.</span> <span id="s1234">My grandmother was taken in '42.</span> <span id="s1235">She went to Theresienstadt, which is the least of the offensive camps.</span> <span id="s1236">It was for indigent and elderly and children.</span> <span id="s1237">It's from that place that those famous drawings came of children, The Butterflies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">ET: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">NP: She didn't last long.</span> <span id="s1240">She died of starvation.</span> <span id="s1241">She was near 78.</span> <span id="s1242">There she was united with a sister and her brother-in-law, from the same region where we came from.</span> <span id="s1243">They all died together.</span> <span id="s1244">And when I think of her, lying on the ground and dying of starva tion, I..</span> <span id="s1245">.</span> <span id="s1246">can't reconcile that with anything ever again in life.</span> <span id="s1247">Because she was the woman who gave, she gave everything.</span> <span id="s1248">She gave every indigent person the same treatment.</span> <span id="s1249">Every poor person, every "shnorrer", as we say, who came to our house.</span> <span id="s1250">He could stay as long as he wanted.</span> <span id="s1251">He was given food.</span> <span id="s1252">She always had clothing.</span> <span id="s1253">She always had something else in an attic room.</span> <span id="s1254">She always had an open home, an empty...chair, table filled with food.</span> <span id="s1255">She was the one who washed the dead bodies when other women said they couldn't.</span> <span id="s1256">And I think of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">ET: Yes, he was lucky.</span> <span id="s1260">My grandfather had died—I forgot to mention that—the year we left, in January, 1941.</span> <span id="s1261">He was 84.</span> <span id="s1262">He died, which was good.</span> <span id="s1263">At least one less to go that way.</span> <span id="s1264">I mourn all the others.</span> <span id="s1265">My father's sister went and her daughter.</span> <span id="s1266">Her husband, too, had died young, so that was one less to go.</span> <span id="s1267">My father's sister fought in the battle of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1268">She was killed in it.</span> <span id="s1269">Her daughter, who was, I think 12, was taken away from her to Auschwitz and was gassed—my first cousin who I spent my summers with at my home.</span> <span id="s1270">I mourn for them.</span> <span id="s1271">But I mourn really only collectively for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1272">And every film I've ever seen about the Holocaust, about the camps, I see only her face.</span> <span id="s1273">She is the primary face.</span> <span id="s1274">And when I see children in camps, I think of my playmates.</span> <span id="s1275">And I also see me.</span> <span id="s1276">I see myself.</span> <span id="s1277">I always see myself in the camps, because with the proximity in time that there but for you go I, I would have been shipped out within four or five months from my town.</span> <span id="s1278">And I don't think I would have survived very long.</span> <span id="s1279">And I often envision what would have been.</span> <span id="s1280">My mother was a tall, statuesque woman, and I don't look anything like her.</span> <span id="s1281">She would have outlasted me, outlived me.</span> <span id="s1282">And the terror of that lives within me, too, the might-have-been.</span> <span id="s1283">I live in the might-have-been, because I was the last to go, last out of the town, last out of the land, last out of Portugal.</span> <span id="s1284">And I have always envisioned myself in a camp.</span> <span id="s1285">And I've had to do a lot of soul searching why God would have saved me.</span> <span id="s1286">I never did lose my faith in God.</span> <span id="s1287">My cousin has.</span> <span id="s1288">The aunt who died in the Warsaw Uprising also had a son exactly my age.</span> <span id="s1289">He came on the children's transport, alone.</span> <span id="s1290">She was able to get him out alone.</span> <span id="s1291">So she sacrificed that.</span> <span id="s1292">He was raised very stringently Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1293">He is a Baptist now.</span> <span id="s1294">He said that his religion had caused him nothing but misery.</span> <span id="s1295">His mother died.</span> <span id="s1296">His sister was killed in Auschwitz, and why should he hold on to it?</span> <span id="s1297">My father chastised him relentlessly.</span> <span id="s1298">He said, "All the more reason that you should cling to it, because of what happened."</span> <span id="s1299">But he did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">NP: Is he alive today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s1302">He's exactly my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">NP: Where is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">ET: Chicago.</span> <span id="s1305">A very bright man, in research chemistry.</span> <span id="s1306">He remained childless—he is married—I..</span> <span id="s1307">.</span> <span id="s1308">have the feeling on purpose.</span> <span id="s1309">So, he was saved and what was, he was saved, but what was saved?</span> <span id="s1310">Was his soul saved?</span> <span id="s1311">His body was saved.</span> <span id="s1312">I too, I forgot to mention was going to be in a children's transport.</span> <span id="s1313">When we lived in the Jew House we were approached again by HIAS whether my parents wanted to get me out.</span> <span id="s1314">It was easier to get a child out, and we called it children's, Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s1315">You know that word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">NP: I know that.</span> <span id="s1317">There is this wonderful woman that works with the Archive named Eva Abraham.</span> <span id="s1318">She lives in Greenhill.</span> <span id="s1319">And she has organized reunions of Kin der, and we have many testimonies and taped interviews of Kinder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">ET: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s1321">Well my cousin then was Kindertransport what we called it.</span> <span id="s1322">and I was considered for it in 1939 while we lived in the Jew House.</span> <span id="s1323">My mother had a brother who lived in Nice, France and he wanted me to live with him.</span> <span id="s1324">Little did we realize that, heh, France was going to go, too.</span> <span id="s1325">And everything was instituted to get me there.</span> <span id="s1326">It took time.</span> <span id="s1327">I didn't tell my parents that I did not want to go.</span> <span id="s1328">I was crying inside at the thought of leaving them.</span> <span id="s1329">I was tortured.</span> <span id="s1330">And I loved my uncle.</span> <span id="s1331">I wanted to be there.</span> <span id="s1332">It sounded won der ful, but I couldn't understand how I could ever leave my parents or be able to accom plish that.</span> <span id="s1333">So, in 1940 in May Hitler conquered France.</span> <span id="s1334">So all that went up in a puff of smoke.</span> <span id="s1335">I was the happiest person alive, that I didn't have to go.</span> <span id="s1336">When France fell to Ger many, I was in Bielefeld, at the end of a school day, and I heard the loudspeakers.</span> <span id="s1337">And people were screaming in the streets.</span> <span id="s1338">Paris had fallen.</span> <span id="s1339">And I went into an alleyway and I quietly cried, because that was the last stronghold of liberty, when Paris fell.</span> <span id="s1340">And I couldn't cry publicly, because that would have been a dead giveaway.</span> <span id="s1341">And because I was so "un-Jewish looking", incidentally, every time I took this train to go to the Rabbi's class in Biel e feld, I was accosted, why I was not in uniform, why I was not on an outing, why I wasn't here or there where I should have been, where all German children were.</span> <span id="s1342">And I made all kinds of excuses.</span> <span id="s1343">I, my hair then was sort of honey-colored.</span> <span id="s1344">And I had the typical little German girl hairdo with a little pin on the side, with straight little short hair.</span> <span id="s1345">And I was always taken for one.</span> <span id="s1346">The other thing I— in retrospect—I think about is the years we spent in the Jew House.</span> <span id="s1347">Air raids were constant, because the British were bombing us forever and ever.</span> <span id="s1348">And we had this ambivalent feeling of, hey, we don't want to get hit, but we want them to hit something wonderful, to destroy this country.</span> <span id="s1349">And the air raids were nightly.</span> <span id="s1350">And then during the day for a while too, but it deprived me of sleep.</span> <span id="s1351">We had by law to go down into an air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s1352">And one night we had five air raids.</span> <span id="s1353">Up and down, and up and down and up and down.</span> <span id="s1354">And we were bombed pretty severely at one point.</span> <span id="s1355">I remem ber falling off the seat as I was sleeping in the air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s1356">A bomb hit very closely and I was rolling on the ground.</span> <span id="s1357">They did quite a bit of damage.</span> <span id="s1358">But we were bombed for two years, and the feeling of wanting them to really hit a fantastic target and yet not wanting to be part of that, it's a strange feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">NP: So this was constant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">ET: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1361">And then, you know, as I said, the last years in, from Crystal Night on until 1941, I call them the gray years in my life.</span> <span id="s1362">They have no color.</span> <span id="s1363">There was no inti macy.</span> <span id="s1364">There was nothing in my town at all.</span> <span id="s1365">We had long, long, long years since been able to go to a movie or to a park or to anything.</span> <span id="s1366">We were not allowed radios.</span> <span id="s1367">So, reading was the only source of information, and education.</span> <span id="s1368">And my father made very sure that I did that.</span> <span id="s1369">And I did read voraciously and avidly.</span> <span id="s1370">But they were very gray years.</span> <span id="s1371">I went, I turned into my inner self a lot.</span> <span id="s1372">I fantasized a lot.</span> <span id="s1373">And when I read Anne Frank, which of course that fate doesn't even touch upon mine, but I..</span> <span id="s1374">.</span> <span id="s1375">sensed her loneliness.</span> <span id="s1376">Because I manufac tured people in that lonely little room in the Jew House.</span> <span id="s1377">And I dressed up.</span> <span id="s1378">And I put perfume on and I read strange books.</span> <span id="s1379">Because I wanted to be somewhere else than where I was.</span> <span id="s1380">The only escape I had was by going to the Rabbi's class in Bielefeld.</span> <span id="s1381">There were some Jewish children there.</span> <span id="s1382">But I always had to return home in the evening to my town where I, there again, I was alone.</span> <span id="s1383">And it was like a..</span> <span id="s1384">.</span> <span id="s1385">cold, iron grip upon me when I would return home, that I would be isolated again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">NP: It was a difficult time of life, being a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">ET: Very difficult.</span> <span id="s1388">It was a very tough period.</span> <span id="s1389">The other sadness was that in the other Jew House was an elderly couple who had a daughter, a married daughter, and a little grandson in Berlin, who would intermittently visit.</span> <span id="s1390">And this little boy was about two-and-a-half or three.</span> <span id="s1391">He was a darling child.</span> <span id="s1392">And I would go over and play with him.</span> <span id="s1393">That was the only thing I could literally do.</span> <span id="s1394">This little child and his parents died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1395">And I look at my grandchildren now.</span> <span id="s1396">And I behold their life as very, very precious.</span> <span id="s1397">And I think of that little boy.</span> <span id="s1398">And it's hard to reconcile a world upon a world where this could happen.</span> <span id="s1399">So needless to say that my four grandchildren to me are the essence of life.</span> <span id="s1400">And, I think maybe that I was saved that I could go on and talk about it, that I could have two children, and that I could have grandchildren, that life has gone on for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">NP: It is a reaffirmation emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">ET: Isn't it.</span> <span id="s1403">It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">NP: Even when you carry this [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">ET: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">NP: It is a reaffirmation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">ET: It is.</span> <span id="s1408">Now, I have been back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">NP: What year did you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">ET: '85, per invitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">NP: Per invitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">ET: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">NP: Was this by the mayor of the town or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s1415">Each town, are we recording?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">NP: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">ET: Oh, O.K. Each town had this little pang of guilt, I think we did something wrong.</span> <span id="s1418">[chuckles] Putting it very mildly.</span> <span id="s1419">And, they all came up with money and plans to have people come back.</span> <span id="s1420">And a letter came inviting my mother and me.</span> <span id="s1421">My mother was failing.</span> <span id="s1422">She's in the Geriatric Center in her ninth year there now.</span> <span id="s1423">And at that time she wasn't that bad, but she didn't grasp it, and I also think, if my mother had gone back into that town...</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">NP: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">ET: She would have killed.</span> <span id="s1426">She would not have been able to tolerate this.</span> <span id="s1427">She would have taken everyone and slashed them.</span> <span id="s1428">So, I wrote to Germany and I asked, "Could I bring my husband in her stead?"</span> <span id="s1429">And they said, "That's O.K." So we were both free.</span> <span id="s1430">And my son and my daughter-in-law had been backpacking in Europe many years before and had been there.</span> <span id="s1431">And my daughter had not been, and she said, "I'm coming."</span> <span id="s1432">So she, the three musketeers—my husband and I and my daughter!</span> <span id="s1433">[laughs] All of us went.</span> <span id="s1434">It was a question of, how would I feel about going back?</span> <span id="s1435">Lots of people go back.</span> <span id="s1436">But they have some semblance of a place that has some reality to them that they can look at.</span> <span id="s1437">I had no thing.</span> <span id="s1438">I mean that house was gone.</span> <span id="s1439">That house, incidentally, burnt to the very ground, down to nothing.</span> <span id="s1440">I think it was looted.</span> <span id="s1441">I think they had to have been fools not to have looted it.</span> <span id="s1442">We had this strong feeling.</span> <span id="s1443">To go back in space a little bit, the day after Crystal Night, my mother and I did walk down momentarily and looked at the smoldering ashes and the glows of fire.</span> <span id="s1444">And there was nothing there, except the stables at the very end of the prop erty and the orchard, and the gazebo and the gardens.</span> <span id="s1445">But the house was totally gone.</span> <span id="s1446">And to go back to nothing, I don't know whether it's harder to go back to nothing or to go back where there was something that's not yours anyway.</span> <span id="s1447">I think either way it's difficult.</span> <span id="s1448">So my husband said, "I think it's good for you to go.</span> <span id="s1449">And you'll see it in the light of today."</span> <span id="s1450">And that, I..</span> <span id="s1451">.</span> <span id="s1452">had nightmares about going back into that burning house.</span> <span id="s1453">Two of them; one I wanted my little box of jewelry.</span> <span id="s1454">I ran up, and I knew the house was burning and that I was, I knew that I was in this country but I was still running back into that house.</span> <span id="s1455">And the other dream was that I couldn't get out of Germany, that my visa was not good, that I already had been to this country, had knowledge of it, but I was in Germany, and that I could not get out.</span> <span id="s1456">So, we decided it probably would be fine for me to see what it was like today.</span> <span id="s1457">So we went.</span> <span id="s1458">And a German couple had contacted my parents, oh, at least ten years before.</span> <span id="s1459">We did not know them.</span> <span id="s1460">They were about my age.</span> <span id="s1461">And the man wrote to my father and said that he, my father started a legal process, and he sued the town.</span> <span id="s1462">He did a wonderful number on them.</span> <span id="s1463">He won a little bit, too.</span> <span id="s1464">He had three people put in jail for setting the house on fire.</span> <span id="s1465">He sued the town for not protecting his property with the fire engines.</span> <span id="s1466">My father loved to write.</span> <span id="s1467">He was very articulate, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">NP: These people were still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">ET: Oh yes, none of which I ever got to see.</span> <span id="s1470">No one came out, except my darling old maids and a couple of old neighbors.</span> <span id="s1471">Not one friend.</span> <span id="s1472">So, anyway, we...did go back.</span> <span id="s1473">And this particular couple had been in contact with my father and then with me.</span> <span id="s1474">They had read about my father's collective writings to the town, and suits.</span> <span id="s1475">And they wanted to write to him.</span> <span id="s1476">The man was a very, I can only say "God fearing" man, who felt on his shoulders the guilt of Germany.</span> <span id="s1477">And he wrote to my father for a long time, came here right before my father's death, which was in '77, and was able to meet my father.</span> <span id="s1478">And he cried when he hugged him.</span> <span id="s1479">He felt the German guilt so extremely, so deep within him.</span> <span id="s1480">And so when we came to the town, he took total charge of us.</span> <span id="s1481">He wouldn't let us take a train from Dü sseldorf to my hometown.</span> <span id="s1482">He came by car and he picked us up and he brought me a rose to welcome me.</span> <span id="s1483">They were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1484">My daughter stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1485">My daughter did not go free, we had to pay for her transport.</span> <span id="s1486">But she was given hospitality at this couple's house.</span> <span id="s1487">And we were put up in a lovely hotel in my hometown.</span> <span id="s1488">And when I touched German soil for the first time, I had a very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s1489">And my husband and my daughter looked around, and I really laughed.</span> <span id="s1490">And he said, "You know we're not in Kansas anymore."</span> <span id="s1491">[chuckles] And we were taken by this lovely man in a car.</span> <span id="s1492">And as we approached the outskirts of my town I had a freezing feeling, a gripping cold feeling around my heart.</span> <span id="s1493">It's the very essence of Germany where I lived.</span> <span id="s1494">The oak trees, deep looks of Germany with forest, the isolated farm houses.</span> <span id="s1495">That's on the outskirts of my town.</span> <span id="s1496">And I saw that.</span> <span id="s1497">I could only think of the oak cluster and the oak leaves.</span> <span id="s1498">I could almost think of the tales of, The Legends of Siegfried.</span> <span id="s1499">It was ominous, and it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1500">And I ac know ledged it that it was so beautiful, as much as I had learned to hate it.</span> <span id="s1501">And then we hit the town.</span> <span id="s1502">And, my daughter and my husband just looked at me.</span> <span id="s1503">I think they thought that one of two things would happen, that I would either scream, or I would just cry.</span> <span id="s1504">I did neither.</span> <span id="s1505">I just took it all in.</span> <span id="s1506">And we were given spending money every day, other than everything having been paid for, $35 a day just to run around.</span> <span id="s1507">I looked around the town.</span> <span id="s1508">My daughter went with me.</span> <span id="s1509">She found little places all of her own that had been my haunts.</span> <span id="s1510">I felt through her that I, she was the young woman who was expressing through her being there, who I had once been.</span> <span id="s1511">She found a little place for a little clasp for her hair that I had found as a child.</span> <span id="s1512">She found a shortcut through a church yard.</span> <span id="s1513">And I said, "How did you know?"</span> <span id="s1514">She said, "I just found it."</span> <span id="s1515">I said, "That was my own short cut."</span> <span id="s1516">And, being there gave me a measure of peace.</span> <span id="s1517">I never dreamt again, about the house.</span> <span id="s1518">I didn't.</span> <span id="s1519">I went back to where the house was.</span> <span id="s1520">That was very hard, I went alone with my husband.</span> <span id="s1521">I don't know where my daughter was that day.</span> <span id="s1522">She had been back with us, but that one visit was alone with my husband.</span> <span id="s1523">And we had this triangle park in front of the house.</span> <span id="s1524">I call it the little Rittenhouse Square of my hometown.</span> <span id="s1525">And it's still there, changed a little only as far as architecture and horticulturally.</span> <span id="s1526">But other than that, it's there.</span> <span id="s1527">The property on which my house stood, I had always said, "I think it was two blocks long."</span> <span id="s1528">And everyone said, "Oh, you were a kid.</span> <span id="s1529">You know, you can't remember."</span> <span id="s1530">My husband looked at it.</span> <span id="s1531">He said, "This is two blocks!</span> <span id="s1532">It's immense!</span> <span id="s1533">I can't believe it!"</span> <span id="s1534">The town took it and built upon it a cultural center, which made me very happy in the sense that my family had cultural evenings.</span> <span id="s1535">We had musical evenings, and poetry.</span> <span id="s1536">It's a center for the arts—dance, music, and stage.</span> <span id="s1537">It's very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1538">The pavement is exactly the way I left it.</span> <span id="s1539">Little stones, the same pavement.</span> <span id="s1540">I couldn't believe that.</span> <span id="s1541">The pavement I had walked on, which I had thought somehow if I would walk on it, the door would be there and the house would be there.</span> <span id="s1542">But there was the center.</span> <span id="s1543">And we had lunch there.</span> <span id="s1544">And, I said, "I swear this lunchroom, this dining room, is on top of my real dining room."</span> <span id="s1545">It's sort of the same space.</span> <span id="s1546">It's a feeling as if you had lived another time, another place, put the two together.</span> <span id="s1547">So the one time I sat there and looked at this place I was with my husband and I really broke up.</span> <span id="s1548">And that was the only time.</span> <span id="s1549">And I said, "You know, this is mine.</span> <span id="s1550">It's not theirs.</span> <span id="s1551">This house is mine.</span> <span id="s1552">They have no right to this."</span> <span id="s1553">And I said, "I want it back.</span> <span id="s1554">I want it the way it was."</span> <span id="s1555">And I was angry.</span> <span id="s1556">And I cried.</span> <span id="s1557">And my husband looked at me and he said, "You're alive.</span> <span id="s1558">You're with the living.</span> <span id="s1559">You are not bones in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1560">You are here."</span> <span id="s1561">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1562">I was fine.</span> <span id="s1563">But I had to say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">NP: You had to set it right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">ET: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1566">It's not theirs.</span> <span id="s1567">It still isn't theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">NP: Was there any possibility of reparations for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">ET: Oh, we've gotten reparations.</span> <span id="s1570">But it's not enough.</span> <span id="s1571">My mother still gets money at the Geriatric Center once a month.</span> <span id="s1572">But that actually is money that she received from my father having had to sign his profession away.</span> <span id="s1573">Deprivation of the right to work.</span> <span id="s1574">And they've been getting this, they, she gets widow's rights since 195-, hmm, middle '50s, I guess.</span> <span id="s1575">They did get a settlement also, for the house, to a point.</span> <span id="s1576">But...it's nothing really.</span> <span id="s1577">It's nothing.</span> <span id="s1578">But you know, one has one's life.</span> <span id="s1579">And that's the most important thing.</span> <span id="s1580">People always say to me, "What'd you, what did you bring out?"</span> <span id="s1581">I said, "Me."</span> <span id="s1582">And, as often as I've talked to friends who've known me a long time, they'll see a little jewelry item on me, "Did you bring that with you?"</span> <span id="s1583">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s1584">Everything was burnt in the house.</span> <span id="s1585">Every thing.</span> <span id="s1586">There is nothing that I have that is my own, ever."</span> <span id="s1587">And that's the hurt of it, that the identity which was once yours, it's only a material identity to say, "I owned this bracelet, I owned this something, this was my mother's, this was my father’s."</span> <span id="s1588">There is a loss from not passing that on.</span> <span id="s1589">Because someone has touched it and it has belonged to someone from a long time ago.</span> <span id="s1590">Someone sent a teaspoon, no, tongs, silver tongs, to my father here, and said that his grandmother in the last century had given it to a maid who took very good care of her.</span> <span id="s1591">And because she knew that we had nothing left, we should have this.</span> <span id="s1592">That's all I have.</span> <span id="s1593">We have old fashioned silver tongs for sugar cubes.</span> <span id="s1594">I don't bemoan or bemourn the fact of what we had.</span> <span id="s1595">I would like to have shared looking at it with my children.</span> <span id="s1596">I liked the house a lot.</span> <span id="s1597">I liked how we lived.</span> <span id="s1598">We had dinner prepared every day for 12 people—dinner is the mid-day meal as you know—just in case someone would come, a relative, a business person or someone, and the maids opened the door and curtsied.</span> <span id="s1599">There was a genteel style of life.</span> <span id="s1600">And although Hitler came and the Nazi world took over, I do remember that.</span> <span id="s1601">And I do like it, and I did like it.</span> <span id="s1602">But it took a long time for me to be able to say, "I did love it."</span> <span id="s1603">I was supposed to have hated it.</span> <span id="s1604">But one can't deny how one was raised.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">NP: So much a part of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">ET: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">NP: It's how you feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s1609">I was also interviewed when I was back in Germany by a young student about the age of my children.</span> <span id="s1610">At that time he was about 30, 31.</span> <span id="s1611">He was doing a doctoral thesis on the Jews of the area.</span> <span id="s1612">The reason he was doing it is because he was a history student at the University of Bielefeld, and something came up about Jews.</span> <span id="s1613">And he said, "What's that?"</span> <span id="s1614">Of course he hadn't known.</span> <span id="s1615">And he and his friends said, "We've got to find out."</span> <span id="s1616">And they researched, and they found out there had been some people from Mars called "Jews" who had once lived in this town.</span> <span id="s1617">And he got caught up in it.</span> <span id="s1618">And he did his doctoral thesis on it.</span> <span id="s1619">And all the people who came back to all the neighboring towns within, as you would say Montgomery County or Townships and so on, he used all the people who came back on tape, and by mail.</span> <span id="s1620">And he wrote the book.</span> <span id="s1621">And I have the book.</span> <span id="s1622">And it is beautiful.</span> <span id="s1623">And he interviewed me for three-and-a-half hours.</span> <span id="s1624">And he said, "Don't give me facts.</span> <span id="s1625">I have them.</span> <span id="s1626">That's my research.</span> <span id="s1627">Give me feelings."</span> <span id="s1628">And, he specifically asked me about the day when I couldn't go swimming, because that was probably the most traumatic thing in my life.</span> <span id="s1629">Because it...was the real cut off of any normal life of child there.</span> <span id="s1630">He interviewed someone else, and it was the most poignant thing I have ever read anyone ever having said about having lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s1631">This man he interviewed lived in Hamlin, where the Pied Piper came from?</span> <span id="s1632">And the river was called the Weser, W-E-S-E-R.</span> <span id="s1633">He talked to him about when he was a child how he swam in that river.</span> <span id="s1634">And he also skated on it in the winter, and how he loved it.</span> <span id="s1635">And he said, "You know, I loved it so much.</span> <span id="s1636">It hurts I loved it that much."</span> <span id="s1637">He said, "I wish I didn't.</span> <span id="s1638">I wish I hadn't.</span> <span id="s1639">But the feeling of love for what it was will never go away, and how I wish it would."</span> <span id="s1640">So anyone who is not truthful or honest with oneself or themselves, you must have loved it the same as your life would be, Natalie, here...</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">NP: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">ET: You loved it, and if you would be expelled from paradise, you would still love that paradise.</span> <span id="s1643">It took me a long, long time to be able to say that, and to let that out.</span> <span id="s1644">For the first many decades that I lived here I was thoroughly, totally American in my mind.</span> <span id="s1645">Whether I, I think I appeared that way because in our first neighborhood in which we lived when we were first married, oh, they knew by my parents' appearance for sure that I came from Germany.</span> <span id="s1646">And I had told them I was but I never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1647">And I have talked about it incessantly in the last ten, twelve years.</span> <span id="s1648">And I think that Elie Wiesel is greatly re spon sible that we all talk about it.</span> <span id="s1649">It wasn't fashionable, and also, it was done with.</span> <span id="s1650">It was over.</span> <span id="s1651">But I think now I know that it was never over, and had brewed inside of me.</span> <span id="s1652">And, I would never have said 30, 40 years ago how I loved Germany.</span> <span id="s1653">I negated everything Ger man.</span> <span id="s1654">I married an American—because I loved him, not because he was an American!</span> <span id="s1655">[laughs] But he happened to be.</span> <span id="s1656">And I stayed with American friends and acquaintances, in an American milieu.</span> <span id="s1657">Probably the more so to negate it.</span> <span id="s1658">But I don't know whether you've found out that people in the last ten, fifteen years have opened up more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">ET: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">NP: Because there have been various gatherings in Jerusalem, Philadelphia, Washington, and survivors began to feel more comfortable giving their testimonies but many times didn’t because they didn’t want to frighten their children, but not knowing their parent’s wartime experiences was frightening to children as well!</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">ET: Mmm.</span> <span id="s1663">My children always knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">NP: And that helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">ET: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1666">My father talked a great deal about it.</span> <span id="s1667">Sometimes perhaps too much, too young for my children, I don't know that.</span> <span id="s1668">But I, I didn't-</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">NP: ...Tarlow.</span> <span id="s1671">This is tape number three, 11-19-93.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">ET: Now where did I leave off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">NP: About the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">ET: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">NP: Your father's sharing with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s1677">My father adored writing, reading, knowledge, and so he imparted a lot of that I think specifically to my son, who very much enjoyed history.</span> <span id="s1678">And it is important that my children know this.</span> <span id="s1679">It is utterly important that my grandchildren will know of this, when they are ready to hear this.</span> <span id="s1680">I want them to know who they are.</span> <span id="s1681">I want them to know how fortunate for me it is to have had them, to know that from that which I came, they also came.</span> <span id="s1682">And I do see in all of them certain traits of my family and whether it's true or whe ther I want to read it into them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1683">In turn my daughter has named her eldest for my father, whose Hebrew name is Simchah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">ET: And that's a delight.</span> <span id="s1686">And, my eldest grandchild Joshua was named for Joseph, who was my father's father, Joseph Meinberg.</span> <span id="s1687">His little sister, Rayna Sophie, her middle name is Sophie for my grandmother, and I dearly love that.</span> <span id="s1688">And my youngest grand daughter, Alexi Michelle, Michelle is for my father's father, who was Max, or Mordecai.</span> <span id="s1689">So they all in turn are someone...who has been.</span> <span id="s1690">And I'm very grateful for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">NP: Your grandmother would have said you did well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">ET: Yes.</span> <span id="s1693">I think I wanted to go on with that, and that's again stepping back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1694">Since we arrived in September, it was three months before Pearl Harbor, in December of 1941, and there were only two communications from my grandmother, because everything stopped after that.</span> <span id="s1695">And she wrote a letter in English at her age.</span> <span id="s1696">And that was not her favorite language.</span> <span id="s1697">She loved French more.</span> <span id="s1698">And she wrote and she said, "I am writing to you in English because this is now the language you have to know and learn.</span> <span id="s1699">And I want you to read English all the time.</span> <span id="s1700">And I hope you're doing well in school, and I hope that you're getting A's."</span> <span id="s1701">And if ever anybody whipped me into it she certainly did.</span> <span id="s1702">And I did get A's.</span> <span id="s1703">[chuckles] It was very important.</span> <span id="s1704">And, I think she deeply touched me with that, when she said, "Do well."</span> <span id="s1705">She knew she'd never, ever see me again and what must have gone through her mind to have let go of me.</span> <span id="s1706">I was one of three grandchildren, but I was living in her home, and I was very special to her.</span> <span id="s1707">So, yes, I..</span> <span id="s1708">.</span> <span id="s1709">think that because of her I made a very strong effort to really do well.</span> <span id="s1710">And I think I imparted that also into my child ren.</span> <span id="s1711">I think they're very strong.</span> <span id="s1712">And, I've talked with them and I know because of my background they have become strong individuals.</span> <span id="s1713">Notwithstanding my husband, but the difficulties that I had encountered I think made them realize that whatever might or would have gone wrong in their lives couldn't measure up to what I had to battle.</span> <span id="s1714">So I think it gave them a lot of strength.</span> <span id="s1715">And they're very productive people and they've married won derful people in turn who complement them very well.</span> <span id="s1716">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">NP: You did do well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">ET: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1719">I really did.</span> <span id="s1720">And I think now, as I am getting older, much more about the past.</span> <span id="s1721">And I read an article about that pertaining to people such as my background war rants.</span> <span id="s1722">The reason we remember now, because the further we are away from it the closer we get to it.</span> <span id="s1723">I think the spanning years mean nothing.</span> <span id="s1724">I think the beginning and the latter, well, the beginning and what is ahead of us now is the important thing.</span> <span id="s1725">And the focus is different now, that we realize that we lived in an incredibly intense part of history.</span> <span id="s1726">It was so over whelmingly awful, and we were caught up in it, and here we are.</span> <span id="s1727">And no matter how little time passes or how much time passes, again and again and again, you will read about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1728">You will read about Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s1729">You will feel it.</span> <span id="s1730">You will look at it on tele vision.</span> <span id="s1731">It never goes away.</span> <span id="s1732">And it's more intensified now than ever.</span> <span id="s1733">It goes on and on and on.</span> <span id="s1734">I personally have watched everything on television.</span> <span id="s1735">I don't know whether I am trying to punish myself by doing that.</span> <span id="s1736">But my mother could never watch one single thing.</span> <span id="s1737">I can understand that.</span> <span id="s1738">She was older.</span> <span id="s1739">She didn't want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1740">She didn't want to read about it.</span> <span id="s1741">She didn't want to know about it.</span> <span id="s1742">My father read intensely.</span> <span id="s1743">He followed every thing.</span> <span id="s1744">She wanted away from it all.</span> <span id="s1745">It took too much out of her life.</span> <span id="s1746">But I have watched all the horror and terror documentaries of the camps.</span> <span id="s1747">And I feel compelled to watch it.</span> <span id="s1748">And I see faces.</span> <span id="s1749">I see children with whom I played who I know did not get out, the relatives I had known who I know died in it.</span> <span id="s1750">But most of all I see myself and I have probably said this before.</span> <span id="s1751">But I do see myself in a camp.</span> <span id="s1752">And I marvel at the people who I've met who've come out of them.</span> <span id="s1753">And I wonder how weak I would have been in one.</span> <span id="s1754">I can't imagine my self even being that strong.</span> <span id="s1755">And so I am compelled to look again and again and again at something which I was saved from by, I think a slot and a slit in time, a door through which I slipped.</span> <span id="s1756">I slipped through that little crack of time which separates me from that fate.</span> <span id="s1757">And I..</span> <span id="s1758">.</span> <span id="s1759">cannot really not think about it, especially as we're talking now.</span> <span id="s1760">And I want to know if other people feel that strongly too.</span> <span id="s1761">Do they express it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">NP: Some cannot—some do.</span> <span id="s1763">It's something that you, time helps them cope, and makes things not so raw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">ET: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">NP: This is not across the board.</span> <span id="s1766">This is up to the individual, they never forget, time helps people to cope, with your testimony and other testimonies, history is really now just being written.</span> <span id="s1767">There is an awareness now like never before, and it's very important to get these stories together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">ET: Well I have written a lot to my hometown.</span> <span id="s1769">I've been in communication with them.</span> <span id="s1770">This Lyceum which I attended had a 100th year anniversary, and they very gingerly approached me, would I write something about myself?</span> <span id="s1771">Since the very first daughter of the town of "Mosaic persuasion" was my aunt named Else Meinberg, and since I was Ellen Meinberg, I was the last, would I write to them?</span> <span id="s1772">And, also, that I should understand that the last director of the Lyceum was certainly not politically involved, and was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1773">Well, I wanted to be very honest, and I thought, well, if they won't publish it, and if they won't, you know, disclose it, that's O.K., but I'm going to write exactly the way I saw it.</span> <span id="s1774">The director was a charming man.</span> <span id="s1775">He was not a political man.</span> <span id="s1776">But he was a cow ard.</span> <span id="s1777">Because the day I could not go swimming—I talk about it all the time, it was the most, probably the greatest soul insult to my little life, I was only ten—he knew about this.</span> <span id="s1778">I was the only Jewish child in that school.</span> <span id="s1779">And he knew.</span> <span id="s1780">The edict came to him.</span> <span id="s1781">He then told the gym teacher.</span> <span id="s1782">So I wrote back in this little testimonial for the 100th anniversary of the school, "You explained to me how apolitical he was, and what a marvelous person he was."</span> <span id="s1783">And I said, "Yes he was.</span> <span id="s1784">He also instructed my English class.</span> <span id="s1785">Other than being a director he was a fine teacher, and he was a fine man.</span> <span id="s1786">But he didn't have any courage, be cause if he had, he would have had the courage to ask a little ten-year-old into his office and said, 'It is out of my jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s1787">It's not in my power to get you to that pool.</span> <span id="s1788">I just want you to know I'm sad you can't go.'</span> <span id="s1789">He disregarded it.</span> <span id="s1790">So, I'm sorry to disagree with you.</span> <span id="s1791">He was not that wonderful.</span> <span id="s1792">He was not big enough."</span> <span id="s1793">They published it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">NP: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">ET: They did.</span> <span id="s1796">They really did.</span> <span id="s1797">And I was happy.</span> <span id="s1798">And, it's a big book.</span> <span id="s1799">I have all these books over in my little library here.</span> <span id="s1800">And, again my public school, which I attended for four years, was renamed Anne Frank School.</span> <span id="s1801">And the family, what is this woman's name, a descendant of the family that housed Anne Frank?</span> <span id="s1802">A Dutch woman, who came to the dedication.</span> <span id="s1803">And they took an excerpt of one of my writings and they had this little girl named Gabriella, who was my age, read, and, "I am the voice of Ellen Meinberg."</span> <span id="s1804">And she read of my being alone in the town and being denied access, and the story of the pool, and my whole life there.</span> <span id="s1805">And the children of that school go once a month and clean up the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1806">So, progress is being made.</span> <span id="s1807">And while I was there during my visit, I tried to enlighten a few people.</span> <span id="s1808">Because, I felt that I had come from another planet, and plopped myself into their midst.</span> <span id="s1809">The hotel in which we stayed, the people who ran it were in their 30s, at that time the age of my children.</span> <span id="s1810">And my daughter came every morning to visit for breakfast.</span> <span id="s1811">And they didn't quite get the connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">And one day they said to me, "You always speak German to us.</span> <span id="s1813">Why is that?"</span> <span id="s1814">And I said, "Because I want to practice my German.</span> <span id="s1815">I'm in Germany."</span> <span id="s1816">They said, "Well all the other people who come here don't want to talk German."</span> <span id="s1817">I said, "Well, I can understand that."</span> <span id="s1818">"And why do you?"</span> <span id="s1819">And I said, "Well, it's a language, and I want to be able to keep it, and I'm here, and I'm talking German."</span> <span id="s1820">"Well why is it that that young girl doesn't speak German?"</span> <span id="s1821">I said, "That's my daughter."</span> <span id="s1822">"Oh.</span> <span id="s1823">Well, she wasn't born here?"</span> <span id="s1824">I said, "Do you know who I am?"</span> <span id="s1825">"Well, yes, we know the young couple, we know who you are.</span> <span id="s1826">A lot of you come every week and stay here.</span> <span id="s1827">And, but were you born here?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1829">"Really?</span> <span id="s1830">What happened to you?"</span> <span id="s1831">And I said very simply, "I lived near the Triangle Park."</span> <span id="s1832">"Oh, well that's a cultural center."</span> <span id="s1833">I said, "Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s1834">But that was once a house in which I lived."</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">"It was!?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">"Yes, it was."</span> <span id="s1837">Oh, so they were listening.</span> <span id="s1838">And, I said, "I went to the same..."
