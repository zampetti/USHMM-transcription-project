Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was born in Frankfurt am Main, because there are two Frankfurts in Germany.</span></p> <p><span

born in 1925, but your -- your father moved to Alsace in 1926, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: But you didn’t move then?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: We moved about one or two years later.</span> <span id="s42">My father opened up a business over there, and we moved in afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And do you know why he moved?</span> <span id="s44">I mean, did you hear later, as -- when you got older, why he left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well, it’s an opportunity, you know, because Germany had [indecipherable] so he had opportunity to go there.</span> <span id="s46">But he didn’t know anyone, but he had a partner over there by the name of Camille Ernst, E-r-n-s-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: And th-this was a -- I guess, a metals recycling plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And what was he doing when he was in Germany?</span> <span id="s50">What was his work?</span> <span id="s51">The same kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Actually, before he went there, he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s53">He was sent -- oh, Palestine at that time, to found a kibbutz, which was called Mahane Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Mahane, M-a-h-a-n-e, Israel.</span> <span id="s56">I went on vacation there, years later, and I found the place again.</span> <span id="s57">It had been damaged because there was a combat going on there in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: So I have pictures with the walls all shot up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: So he went there in the 20’s, in the early 20’s, before you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes, in -- about ’22 or ’23.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Somewhere like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And what -- so that he didn’t have a business in Germany, when he came back, he decided to go to Alsace, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I am not sure that time, because -- I do know that -- the funny part I heard is that he was once on the train traveling, and then he bought a home, sight unseen, from someone on the train.</span> <span id="s66">That -- so I guess he must have had money at the time, and if he had any occupation, I would not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: That’s the kind of a person he was, I mean, makes decisions on the spur

Selestat.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Selestat.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s79">And that is where he went into business with Camille Ernst.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s81">Which turned out much later to be very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Now, what is metal recycling, do you know?</span> <span id="s86">Do --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: All -- bot -- all iron, you know, is just like what they do over here nowadays, it’s -- material can be reused again.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I guess they were ahead of his time, because they -- this is very popular now.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So then he would sell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Sell the -- sell this --</span></p> <p><span

Right.</span> <span id="s120">So let’s talk a little about li -- what it was like when you were a kid at h -- at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, I guess --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: One thing I remember very well, and it is, I used to go to school in Selestat, Collège Koeberle it was called, and some kids used to pick on me to the point where I did not want to go to school, and I was hiding near the house, in the house, actually, under the stairway, until a neighbor found me over there and reported me to my mom.</span> <span id="s124">So she took me to school at that time.</span> <span id="s125">I-It -- it -- it went on for a few days before she caught me.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So you would stay there all day and then when it was time for kids to come home, you’d come out?</span></p> <p><span

id="s133">A: Because I was hidden under the staircase.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So how did the neighbor find you?</span> <span id="s135">Why did the neighbor even look for you?</span> <span id="s136">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I guess they were not looking for me, but they accidentally saw me, I guess, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: -- they ha -- reported me.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Did you -- did you tell your mother why you were doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And what did she say?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: She took me to school and she told the teacher why I was missing classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: And the teacher then brought it up to the other students, and that ceased, and there was no more problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So there was no more problem, they left you -- it was fine?</span> <span id="s147">Why was this kid picking on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Well, you know, there’s always big bullies in -- everywhere.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s613">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Fred, you were describing the German attack of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Okay, so the Germans attacked through Luxembourg and Belgium --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: And Holland, of course.</span> <span id="s619">And they came around the mountain, the Vosges mountains.</span> <span id="s620">On the 15th of June, 1940, they open up with the artillery on the other side of the Rhine.</span> <span id="s621">We were about 19 kilometers from the Rhine, so it did not affect us directly, but we knew things were going wrong.</span> <span id="s622">So my father was on duty at the zo -- station, yeah, on the 14th, and already he is -- people that work for him in the first aid station, start to question, when the Germans come in, should we salute them heil Hitler, or should we salute them the French way?</span> <span id="s623">My father says, “Oh-oh, this doesn’t sound good.”</span> <span id="s624">So immediately he went to his superior and asked for a transfer out to go to interior of France.</span> <span id="s625">He received an ordre démission.</span> <span id="s626">It’s an order that the authorities have to help him out to go to where he has to go, and this was Bordeaux, on the other end of France.</span> <span id="s627">We were told to be at the railroad station at --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Can I stop you for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Whe -- when your father realizes that everybody around him is trying to figure out how to accommodate the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: So does he think of himself as vulnerable because he’s Jewish, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s634">It’s cl --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: He does?</span> <span id="s636">It’s very clear to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Oh yes, because of the -- what happened to his two brother-in-laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: What happened to --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: The brother-in-laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span> <span id="s641">And he knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Sure, he knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s644">So when he goes to his superior, does he say look, I -- you know, this is dangerous for me and family and I have got to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: There was no question --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: There was no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: He wa -- he will be given the authority to leave, and to get the help of -- assistance of [indecipherable] authorities --</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: -- to go to Bordeaux.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Okay, so you’re going to go to Bordeaux the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: No, we tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: You tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: On the 15th, we go -- we are told to go -- be at railroad station at 10 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s654">We go there, the train had left about si -- seven o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s655">That was the last train out of Colmar.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: So do you think you -- he was given bad information on purpose --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: -- or people just didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: No, I guess they were realizing the situation was worse than they thought, and they had to leave earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: So we had actually left the house with a few things on our back, and a bicycle.</span> <span id="s662">We figured, oh, we are going to be gone for a short time, and be back soon, so we didn’t take too much, except what we could take with us.</span> <span id="s663">Silverware, and food, and that’s about it, you know.</span> <span id="s664">So my father decides we are going to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: To Bordeaux?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: On the road, on the road.</span> <span id="s667">So we go south, and there is a Protestant minister, he comes along with a horse drawn carriage, and he seems to realize what goes on, and he invites my sister and my mother on the cart, because he had room for two people.</span> <span id="s668">And he rides on a few miles, and -- kilometers, and drops them off when he takes it off-road.</span> <span id="s669">We, in the meantime catch up with my mom and sister, and quickly walking, I’m not sure how lo -- how far we walking, we must have walked between eight and 10 miles.</span> <span id="s670">Along comes this army truck that is going back -- was retreating, and they pick us up.</span> <span id="s671">With the bicycle, too.</span> <span id="s672">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s673">There was nobody else on the road except us.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: When the minister left us, he says, “God be wi -- wi -- will be with you.”</span> <span id="s676">He realized what was going on.</span> <span id="s677">And so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Does it -- does it surprise you now that nobody else was on the road, that you were the only ones on the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Doesn’t that seem surprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Well, you know, the local people didn’t have to worry about the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Other ones may not have the means, or no -- no car, or so --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Remember that the French army had the authority to requisition cars for their needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Because there are only so many army trucks or whatnot, and they had all -- also requisitioned our car.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Uh-huh, so you didn’t ha -- I see, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: The military.</span> <span id="s690">So we didn’t have transportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: -- didn’t have a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: What did your dad tell you and the kids?</span> <span id="s694">What di -- were you frightened when you were on this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Well, we were very concerned, of course.</span> <span id="s696">We were not pleased to -- to leave, you know, on foot or so.</span> <span id="s697">But we thought it was an emergency, and my parents know what’s best for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: So the truck drove us for some distance, and had dropped us off.</span> <span id="s700">Along comes this so -- young recruit, actually it was a civilian in a car, and he has orders to report to a certain area.</span> <span id="s701">So he takes us on.</span> <span id="s702">We are driving down to Dole . . . Dijon, that area, and things got very hot.</span> <span id="s703">There was a big tank -- gas tank, burning.</span> <span id="s704">I’m not sure if the army had done it to destroy it, or if the Germans had machine-gunned it, but it was burning at night.</span> <span id="s705">That gave us a chance to drive at night with, you know -- but at that point we run into traffic.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: And got really hectic.</span> <span id="s708">If somebody run out of gas, or had a pa -- had a problem with his car, the cars behind him stopped, pushed him off the road, with the people inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Nothing get in the way.</span> <span id="s711">They had to go on.</span> <span id="s712">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s713">There is no es -- it’s me, me, me and I don’t care about anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: It’s really scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: It was very scary, especially when they don’t let the people get out of the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s717">So you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s719">And we got to [indecipherable], we got to Rouen, we got into a train, and oh, the démission gave us permission to go on any train, in any -- get any assistance from the military or civilians.</span> <span id="s720">So the train stops a few miles down, and they tell us to get out.</span> <span id="s721">No, the -- at -- the train stops in the station, and there’s a Italian plane flying over.</span> <span id="s722">And we say, oh gosh, they were machine gunners.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: They -- it was in front of our compartment, it was a flatbed with a machine gun, right, a French machine gun, and about three or four French soldiers.</span> <span id="s725">That was a bad situation because civilians and military -- if you see troops there, you have a right to shoot at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: If you believe in the Geneva Convention that civilians are protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Then came the order, all civilians off the train.</span> <span id="s730">We are expecting an attack by Italian planes.</span> <span id="s731">So we get out of the station.</span> <span id="s732">I think it was just a trick.</span> <span id="s733">The French authorities want to have the train to themselves to put more troops on there.</span> <span id="s734">We go outside of the station and there my father meets a couple from Frankfurt -- he never knew -- I mean, he knew who they were, and they didn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s735">And they were -- then we -- we gave them, we talked to them.</span> <span id="s736">They owned a movie -- a -- a movie i-in Frankfurt, and my parents knew about that.</span> <span id="s737">So they said, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s738">They said, well, they’re here from Belgium, they had escaped from Belgium, and they were completely lost.</span> <span id="s739">So my father decides, we are going back on the train now.</span> <span id="s740">And he says, “You come with us, and don’t say a word.”</span> <span id="s741">There is a soldier there with a fixed bayonet to prevent people from going on.</span> <span id="s742">My father says, “You follow me.”</span> <span id="s743">And we go by, he presents the order, and we walk right through.</span> <span id="s744">The soldier did not even have time to read it.</span> <span id="s745">He let us go by.</span> <span id="s746">I mean, my father bluffed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Get back on the train -- excuse me -- and then the train takes off.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: When you saw this, were you surprised at how your father was acting, or was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: I guess h-he -- he surprised me, but I know I -- I just follow orders.</span> <span id="s751">He says, you know -</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: No, I understand that, but it did surprise you that your father did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Oh, it surprised me very, yes.</span> <span id="s754">Especially because the people there --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: -- come with us, and -- and have their luggage, too, you know?</span> <span id="s757">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: So, clearly, the situation brought something out in your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: It’s a decision -- they have -- time to make a decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: And he just made the decisions and just did things, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Then we go on the train, and now in the com-compartment there are some ci-civilians coming on, and there is a guy from the -- a civilian, he has a French army pack with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: A French army?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Pack.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Pack.</span> <span id="s765">Oh, an a -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: A -- a -- a -- for a -- outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Right.</span> <span id="s769">He was in c -- i-in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s770">And the -- the gendarmes are coming now, and checking for deserters.</span> <span id="s771">My father says to the guy, “You better throw that pack out or they’re going to arrest you.”</span> <span id="s772">Because he was a desert-serter.</span> <span id="s773">So he threw the pack out.</span> <span id="s774">He saved his neck, probably, too, because he got [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: I’m sure he saved his neck.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Then, to continue --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: But your father was obviously so observant of what was going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: -- so that he could make these kinds of decisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: It was quite amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Then there were some young students on the train, and they had mon -- a -- harmonicas and they would sing th -- tha -- playing music.</span> <span id="s783">It was very encouraging, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: And my mother gave them some bread, too, they were st -- starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So you gave them food?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Yeah, bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: We had -- that’s all we had is bread at the time.</span> <span id="s790">We -- we shared it with them.</span> <span id="s791">And then we stopped in the station, and th-there was a wine -- there was another tr-train on the other side of the rail, and we looked out there, there’s a -- a soldier laying on the floor.</span> <span id="s792">The train had been machine gunned, and this was a tank truck of wine, full of holes, and the soldiers were just laying down letting the wine go into his mouth.</span> <span id="s793">He was so amusing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: He was the only -- only soldier doing this?</span> <span id="s795">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: He was [indecipherable] doing it for free, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: I mean -- and then we go back on the train.</span> <span id="s799">We didn’t get -- we didn’t get off the train because we didn’t want to t-take a chance on train leaving and leave us behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s801">So you stayed on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s803">Different station, we run out of water, so farmers come over and sell us water, at a franc, one franc per glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: That’s a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: It was, and taking advantage of a situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: And another [indecipherable] we had what they call a buffet, in French, in the railroad stations.</span> <span id="s808">And they had food at exorbitant prices, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: We bought whatever we could there, and then after about nine days, we wound up in Bordeaux.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Nine days.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Took us nine days traveling.</span> <span id="s813">And si -- the -- or the train stops and [indecipherable] and try and get food.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: So there’s clearly not much chance to wash yourself anywhere, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Oh no, oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: There’s nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Not -- no, nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And are there bathroom facilities on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s822">I know -- maybe -- probably you had to go outside in the station’s -- regular train stations there.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: When it stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: And as you go on the train stop, we go to the gare, which was a railroad station, and this one guy comes over, and it was a competitor of my fa-father, he was in the radio business in Colmar.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: He was in the radio business?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Yes, he was a competitor of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: He was a competitor, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: So he asked my father, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s831">He says, “Well, we just came from Colmar.”</span> <span id="s832">He said, “I’ll find a -- a place for you.”</span> <span id="s833">For one night he put us up in a -- in an apartment.</span> <span id="s834">Then, they were sending these troops on the railroad station that had been abandoned by their officers.</span> <span id="s835">They didn’t speak French, they had no money, they had no food.</span> <span id="s836">And they were looking at us, you know, jealously because we were eating.</span> <span id="s837">So my mom said, sh -- let’s share bread with tha -- them.</span> <span id="s838">There were about four or five of them, you know, so we share the bread with them, and they were so happy, because they had no-nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: But that was your mother who said that, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: It’s very emotional.</span> <span id="s841">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: It’s very what?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Oh, emotional, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Very -- now.</span> <span id="s846">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Why -- why was it so emotional, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: It is for me now.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: That I think about it, you know, because m-mother was thinking of them, of the soldiers, that they need help, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: And then, in the night -- or the night before, Italian planes had bombed Bordeaux, and it was time to get out.</span> <span id="s853">So we go to the -- is -- Bordeaux is a port city, so we go to the port, and to the [indecipherable] authorities, and he showed them the p -- the pass, we have to go to Bordeaux, and we want to go to England.</span> <span id="s854">The -- the -- the officer says, “Okay, come back to -- tomorrow, and there’s a ship going to England,” and he’s prepared the papers for us, too.</span> <span id="s855">Next morning, same thing happened, the ship had left.</span> <span id="s856">Last ship.</span> <span id="s857">So, then the ar -- neighbors -- the papers come out that the armistice has been signed, the German ath-authorities -- army will occupy northern France and the whole western coast --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: -- including Bordeaux, all the way to -- to Spain.</span> <span id="s860">It’s time for us to get -- move on again.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: And you’re only there what, for a day or two, few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s863">One day.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: One day.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: One day.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: This is -- this was about the 23rd -- I don’t know the exact date, but this came in the paper there.</span> <span id="s868">And then my father says, “Let’s go on to Toulouse.”</span> <span id="s869">Toulouse -- we had a map, so we knew which was occupied zone, which was not occupied.</span> <span id="s870">So we go in the train, and in Toulouse we got off, and there are thousands of people in Toulouse.</span> <span id="s871">People came from Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, from all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: The north of France, from Germany, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: And why was Toulouse such a attractive --</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: This was a large city.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: A large city in a non-occupied zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: And you could like go close to the border to see -- to the occupied zone, we were not interested in that.</span> <span id="s880">And this was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s882">You wanted to get as far away as you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes, and this was not too far from the Spanish border either.</span> <span id="s884">So we go there, and they have big plaques -- how can I say?</span> <span id="s885">Blackboards where people -- I look for this one, I look for that one.</span> <span id="s886">This a-army unit, and this a -- a -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: -- you know, they were trying to find each other over there.</span> <span id="s889">And then there was a big cab -- a sik -- a big place for the refugees to get food.</span> <span id="s890">So we went over there, and there [indecipherable] line over there, too, you know?</span> <span id="s891">You know, was terrible, I mean, it took long hours to get there.</span> <span id="s892">And then we do find an apartment, and find a small place at -- an old man there, rue Petraque, P-e-t-r-a-q-u-e.</span> <span id="s893">Petraque was a Greek, or -- or -- or an poet or something like that.</span> <span id="s894">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: So, we go there, and the man is very nice to us, and he says, “Look, we have no beds over here, but I know a place where we can get you mattresses.”</span> <span id="s897">So this was a factory that had shut down, and they had mattresses for their employees.</span> <span id="s898">We go over there with a handcart and we buy three or four mattresses, o-or five mattresses, and he brings us -- bring home to us again.</span> <span id="s899">So tha -- this a place to sleep on.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: So what was this place like?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: It was a small house, he had him and his son in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: And he had, I guess, two rooms available, so we slept there on the floor.</span> <span id="s904">And next day, or a few days later, I helped him, he was putting a -- a floor board, replacing the old board, and I helped him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: And you helped him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: He -- he -- he went to buy the lumber and all that, and I helped him put s-strips in there --</span></p> <p><span

id="s917">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: It’s like a passport also, different pages.</span> <span id="s919">So we get to the consulate, big lines over there.</span> <span id="s920">Finally we get to the consul, I was with him, and he would like to have passport.</span> <span id="s921">The girl says, “Where were you born?”</span> <span id="s922">In so and so, western Poland.</span> <span id="s923">He speaks Polish with the consul.</span> <span id="s924">He says, “But you have no passport.”</span> <span id="s925">That’s why I am here for.</span> <span id="s926">I want to go get the documentation.</span> <span id="s927">He says, “But you left Poland in 1919, that was when -- or ’18 -- when you became aus -- it was Austrian before that, so you’re not actually Polish,” he says, “I can’t give you a passport, except [indecipherable] exception, your son is -- the oldest one is 19 years old?”</span> <span id="s928">No, 17 or eight -- “18 years old, and if he joins the Polish army, I will give him a passport.”</span> <span id="s929">He said, “Thank you very much.”</span> <span id="s930">[indecipherable] We left.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: So they were going to take Max in

id="s939">Q: So you’re in France without any sort of identification except that you’re foreigners?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: That’s right, there’s foreign -- like, it’s a green card of about eight, 10 pages, I believe, and it’s like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: But only my parents had that, and my brother.</span> <span id="s943">My sister also, I believe, because they were employed, so they had the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: And you had nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: No, because I didn’t -- I wasn’t working.</span> <span id="s946">I -- I -- I was not a certain age, I didn’t need an --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: -- identity card.</span> <span id="s949">So what happened then?</span> <span id="s950">We are back in the house -- one morning, about five o’clock in the morning, knock on the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: This is the same house, with this -- where you bought these mattresses, yes?</span> <span id="s952">Or are you at a different place?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Where we lived, where we stayed at.</span> <span id="s954">Where we stay overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Where you were staying, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s957">And I -- as -- was going to say [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Was there a knock on the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Knock on the door, and then they had these inspectors -- inspector, and come with us, they asked us.</span> <span id="s960">They put us in what they call a black Mar -- Maria, this is a police wagon, and I said, “Why you are arrestings us?”</span> <span id="s961">Don’t ask questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: These are not Germans, these are French.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: No, the French police.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s967">The cart is full now, and then I found out later what th -- the course was.</span> <span id="s968">The French government in Lotrower issued an order that all those who came to France after 1936 should be sent to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: But the authorities had also the latitude to arrest anybody that came before 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: And prefect did not like Jews particularly, so he said it doesn’t make a difference what the -- time they came in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: As long as -- yes, take them.</span> <span id="s975">The reason originally of that was that France, Vichy government was against Communists, came from Spain, from the 1936 revolution.</span> <span id="s976">So, they had those in mind first, and then anybody that came from Belgium, Holland and Germany, and [indecipherable] after ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: And what year was that ruling put into place, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: In 1940, in November.</span> <span

put in small camp, I forgot the name of it, Recebedou, or an --</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: This was before Agde?</span> <span id="s985">A: Yes, this was in the area of Toulouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: So, my father knew somebody in the prefecture, in the governor’s office, who had just -- you signed in -- as foreigner you had to register.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: So he said, maybe this guy can help us out.</span> <span id="s990">So he asked the camp commander, captain -- the camp was actually surrounded by boy scouts, that’s what I had -- in charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s991">[indecipherable] captain --</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: This is not Agde, this is

Boy scouts.</span> <span id="s1000">They -- th-they not -- they didn’t arrest the people, they let them go in and out if they had some justification.</span> <span id="s1001">It wasn’t a camp to hold them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Oh, right, so it was a holding camp of some kind --</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: -- a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: So my father asked the captain to be authorized to go to Toulouse to meet this man from prefecture.</span> <span id="s1006">Okay, fine.</span> <span id="s1007">So him and my fa -- and my sister hitchhiked to Toulouse, there was the prefecture -- to see this man, and thi -- they ask him, why didn’t you tell us that the workers who are [indecipherable] you know, you could have given us a warning.</span> <span id="s1008">The guy sh-shook his sh-shoulders.</span> <span id="s1009">You know.</span> <span id="s1010">Sorry about that, you know.</span> <span id="s1011">I cannot do anything for you.</span> <span id="s1012">They go back to the camp because we are still there [indecipherable] us, my mom, my brother and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: And then they say okay, everybody let’s march railroad station.</span> <span id="s1015">They pug u -- put us in a cattle car.</span> <span id="s1016">French have a fancy name

And put us in there.</span> <span id="s1019">No windows.</span> <span id="s1020">So it had maybe a small opening for air.</span> <span id="s1021">And the cabin had a few other people in it.</span> <span id="s1022">And the train goes on the way, for hours and hours and hours.</span> <span id="s1023">At night we arrive, I believe is Montpellier.</span> <span id="s1024">And in Montpellier they open up the door, and they let Red Cross nurses give us some water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Give you water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1028">Then they close the doors again, and we continue to Agde.</span> <span id="s1029">Everybody out, it’s middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1030">We had to march to the village of Agde, you know, with luggage and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1031">Was quite a march, and then went into the camp, and they say well, go to -- guys over here.</span> <span

guys [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Did you take some stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Well, the guy gave us a few things, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: -- th-then [indecipherable] so then what happened is the camp commander let people go out sometimes if they had to go to see a dentist or a doctor or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: He gave them a permit for a few hours.</span> <span id="s1192">While they were out in the city, in the village, that is to say, they sometimes were able to buy stuff for themselves or for other people, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: And they brought in food.</span> <span id="s1195">That helped.</span> <span id="s1196">If those -- if you had money, you could buy some stuff, you know.</span> <span id="s1197">Well, when we realized that you could go out of certain -- on certain conditions, we decided -- my father decided, let’s see if we can go out completely, permanently.</span> <span id="s1198">So he -- there was a -- a young lady in the cap -- captain’s office, a st-stenographer.</span> <span id="s1199">And my sister was with her [indecipherable] in the same camp with the -- barrack with the woman, and she says, you know, they need another s -- not stenographer, dactylo, a --a typist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: And w-why don’t you apply for a job?</span> <span id="s1202">So my s -- my sister said okay.</span> <span id="s1203">So she applies for the job, and she was there a few days, my father says, you know, ask if I can go to a od -- to a -- the prefecture in Montpellier, to see the governor.</span> <span id="s1204">Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Now let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1206">How did your father make contact with your sister, if you were in different barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Wel -- we had -- we had visiting times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: There were visiting times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1210">Ev -- every --</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Every day, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: No, every so often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Within a few days, or maybe a few times in a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: So your father is immediately thinking, how can I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Yeah, I’m not going to be here, I’m not going to stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: I’m not going to stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: I’ve got to figure out a way to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1221">And -- at that time we did not know the 36 -- 1936 law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: So my father -- my -- my sister is performing very satisfactorily for her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: -- captain, and my father says, “Ask for permit to go to Montpellier,” for her and him, because sh -- he didn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s1226">Captain says fine, but he had hostages there, my mom, and my brother and me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: -- so he was not afraid he was -- escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Fine, so they go to Montpellier, find out where the prefecture is, where the prefect’s office is, and in the hallway, they’re already down there and this man comes towards them, and they look at each other.</span> <span id="s1231">The man says, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1232">That was Camille Ernst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: The man with whom your -- your father was the -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Partner before.</span> <span id="s1235">Father says, “We’re at camp in Agde.”</span> <span id="s1236">So he says, “What?</span> <span id="s1237">You are free.”</span> <span id="s1238">And he releases us either way, and he says to my father, are there more people that you know -- and he explained to my father what the story was with the 1936 law, but you were here before.</span> <span id="s1239">So he says, “Do you know more people in the same situation that came before 1936 in the camp?”</span> <span id="s1240">Off the top of his head my father had met people already in the camp, in the barrack, and he remembered -- thought of 36 people including us five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: And Ernst puts all the names down on the same list, he says they are all free.</span> <span id="s1243">Then he says, “I want you to stay in the camp of Agde, and in the village of Agde.”</span> <span id="s1244">My father says “Why?”</span> <span id="s1245">He says, “I want you to help free all the people that can be freed from the camp.”</span> <span id="s1246">He was -- a hand to the heart.</span> <span id="s1247">So my father says, “Well, how can they po -- ho-how can they be freed?</span> <span id="s1248">What does it need to be [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1249">He says, “If they have the means, they came -- first of all, they have to be in France since before 1936.</span> <span id="s1250">They have to have the resources to exist in France without falling in the charge of the French government.”</span> <span id="s1251">That was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: And that was for a period of about a year, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: About a year, if I remember correctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: And my father says, “That’s nice.</span> <span id="s1256">How about people who have no money?”</span> <span id="s1257">He says, “We will find a way.”</span> <span id="s1258">And -- okay, so my father and my sister come back, my father sees -- become -- right away I see him, he says, “Keep your mouth shut, but we are free.”</span> <span id="s1259">He didn’t want to cause a panic in the -- in the barrack, you know, people getting all excited.</span> <span id="s1260">And then he explains --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: And did -- did Mr. Ernst give your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: A pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: A pass.</span> <span id="s1264">So if you would --</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: What happened -- he gave them the list, the whole list actually, and -- had to be turned in o the captain of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: And how does Ernst have this power to do that?</span> <span id="s1267">Do you understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: He was in charge of the police.</span> <span id="s1269">He was under the prefect, the second in charge.</span> <span id="s1270">He wa -- his title was secretaire generale, and he looked at the -- looked from Dr. Zuco -- Zu --</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Zuccotti?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Yes, Zuccotti.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: And [indecipherable] secretaire generale.</span> <span id="s1275">Him, and then the other gentleman who was working for him.</span> <span id="s1276">Actually, everybody w-working for him.</span> <span id="s1277">You know he reported to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: -- governor -- excuse me -- Mr. Verdi -- Berdetti.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: This was very emotional for you when your father came back and told you the story, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yes, he says, “Don’t say anything.”</span> <span id="s1282">He didn’t want to cause a panic.</span> <span id="s1283">H-He da -- spoke to the individuals from the barrack who were going to be freed.</span> <span id="s1284">There wasn’t [indecipherable] they had their wives too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Just fo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: But he called them up one at a time, and told them, keep your mouth shut, but you are free tomorrow, you’ll get out.</span> <span id="s1289">So the list was in the hands of the captain, an he issued individuals -- individual releases.</span> <span id="s1290">That’s why our release has a number of blanks, about four or five lines, but it was actually a whole list of people.</span> <span id="s1291">So he issued that for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: And the captain, Tass -- Tassart is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Tassart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Tassart?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: N-N-No question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: No question.</span> <span id="s1298">Orders are orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Well, this is -- this is the orders and this is what he’s going to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: So were peop -- were other people upset that you folks were leaving, or did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: They didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: We did not tell, and the next morning we were -- we ready to go.</span> <span id="s1305">That’s where they found out that the -- a few people ba -- not just us, but a few other ones --</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: -- were released.</span> <span id="s1308">And then they asked, how come they’re released?</span> <span id="s1309">Well, we came before 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: That camp was a whole bunch of Spanish internees, because they came after ’36.</span> <span id="s1312">They had been interned because they -- lots of them were Communists --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: And that the French didn’t care for them [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1315">Even though Germany became an ally of the German -- of the Russians -- the Communists --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: -- the French did not -- didn’t say [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: The French didn’t like the Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: For Germans it was just an expedient to occupy part of fro -- Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s1322">And so we took the train and we -- somehow I guess we wound up in the Jewish organization, and we asked them to help us find a place.</span> <span id="s1323">And we ran out of funds at that time, because we could not go back to -- Alsace was occupied.</span> <span id="s1324">The banks, everything had been seized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: So we were running out of money.</span> <span id="s1327">They helped us out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: And where -- where did you go from Agde?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: In Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: You went back to Mo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Montpellier</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1334">To that Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1335">And they were helping all the refugees --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: -- that was the funds from the Jewish organizations, from the United States.</span> <span id="s1338">Then, we met somebody over there, and we ask him if he knew where they had places for rent.</span> <span id="s1339">And he says, “Yes, come with us.</span> <span id="s1340">I live in Celleneuve,” which is small village outside of Montpellier, we rode up a trolley car.</span> <span id="s1341">Went over there, we found this home.</span> <span id="s1342">It was not the fanciest place, it has a stable underneath there, but hey, we lived there, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1343">So we stayed there for the first time, in ce -- in Celleneuve, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1344">These people are from Belgium, and they lived in the same village.</span> <span id="s1345">Unfortunately, they are on the -- okay, then, later on came ins-instructions to arrest the people, I think it was in the s-summer of 1942.</span> <span id="s1346">They had what they call razzias, r-a-z-z -- double z - i-a-s, or rafles, r-a - one f - l-e-s.</span> <span id="s1347">And they just came, gendarmes a-arrested -- no, they arrested at certain cell blocks, homes.</span> <span id="s1348">And they searched anybody in the street.</span> <span id="s1349">If they see you walk into a hallway, they would hassle you, because they knew that you were trying to hide.</span> <span id="s1350">So they check identity [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1351">Then the -- if they had the ideas that you came to France after ’36, they took you in right away, arrested you.</span> <span id="s1352">At that time, my father had connections with the boy scouts, the leader.</span> <span id="s1353">He [indecipherable] in one of the books by Ann Latour, which was [indecipherable] here, was sold in the museum, and [indecipherable] name.</span> <span id="s1354">Anyway, we found places for some of the people, hiding places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Let me stop you for a moment.</span> <span id="s1356">Aren’t you forgetting the f -- your father and sister going back and forth into Agde?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1358">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: This i -- this is a very big, important story, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1361">So, when he stayed in Agde, then he went to the camp commander, Tassart, who helped him out, sort out who was there before 1936 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: -- this was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: And my father approached him, he says, “You can be free if you meet certain requirements.”</span> <span id="s1366">1936, and means of -- of existing on the outside.</span> <span id="s1367">“But,” he says, “you must also help people who have no funds.</span> <span id="s1368">You must lend it to them, and they give back to you when they get out.”</span> <span id="s1369">Because this was another of -- transaction outside the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: So the -- okay, and my father was able to get about 1500 people out this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: It’s extraordinary story, you know.</span> <span id="s1373">In how long a period of time was this go on?</span> <span id="s1374">Months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: It was -- oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1376">It was from November to February or March, just before we went to Montpellier.</span> <span id="s1377">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: So it’s in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: -- in Agde.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: -- November of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: ’40 to ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: To ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: About.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: To February ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: I believe so.</span> <span id="s1386">Now what happened at that time -- so these people were free.</span> <span id="s1387">The other thing happened.</span> <span id="s1388">Ernst told my father, you know, I suspect anybody -- somebody over here is writing down the serial numbers of the bills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: So we became money launderers, we trade the bills so there was always constant new supply.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: So who was doing the money laundering?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: My brother, my sister and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Your brother and your si -- the three of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: The three of us.</span> <span id="s1395">Went to grocery stores, we went to banks.</span> <span id="s1396">We -- or so -- we brought food into the camp, too.</span> <span id="s1397">So people gave us the money to buy food for them, and so we had a-an exchange also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Now, all of you had passes to go in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: I have one here from my mom and my father.</span> <span id="s1402">And the passport is for every day, seven days a week.</span> <span id="s1403">From eight o’clock in the morning til seven o’clock at night, that’s 11 hours.</span> <span id="s1404">That wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: It’s really rather extraordinary, but this happened in a number of places in France, I gather, that people were able to get passes to go in and out [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: I don’t know about the other camps.</span> <span id="s1407">I don’t know, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: But at least there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: But this camp, because of Ernst, was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: And I have the original pass with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Did your father see Ernst on a fairly regular basis, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Well, every time people were freed, they had to get to Montpellier.</span> <span id="s1416">And so they were accompa -- accompanied by either my father, or my si -- [indecipherable] my father, my sister or my sister [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1419">Because they had to go through [indecipherable] over there.</span> <span id="s1420">They didn’t had -- excuse me -- they couldn’t send somebody to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: And then show the money [indecipherable], no, had to be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1424">But now, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1425">When people didn’t have money --</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: -- and the people who did have money would lend them the money --</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: So they gave it to my sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: -- then they leave, and then they gave it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: -- to take back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Take it back so it can be used again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: To [indecipherable] the list, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: -- return the money to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: But now these people leave, and they really don’t have money.</span> <span id="s1436">So now, how do they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Well, they went to Jewish Committee to help them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: In Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: That’s where they were hiding, in Montpellier, at that point.</span> <span id="s1442">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: And then they were helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: They were helped, yes.</span> <span id="s1445">Some had the visa to go to other countries, they had visa to go to Portugal.</span> <span id="s1446">We have a very important pa -- place to go through it, to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Because if you had a visa from the United States, you had to go through port -- Spain or Portugal, and many people waited in Portugal for their American visas to come through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: So the Joint Distribution or other organizations helped them out monetarily to go to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: -- these places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1454">Were you folks frightened during this period or did you all feel very safe once you had the pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Well, as long as we knew Ernst, we felt very safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Then you -- then you felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: I forgot to say also, in those days they have also soup kitchen for all the refugees.</span> <span id="s1458">Food, the -- either the Red Cross or other organizations had food, they sit -- they u -- went to those places.</span> <span id="s1459">So the people who came out of the camp, and us too for awhile, ate in those places because we had no resources, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: So your situation was not so terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Your situation was not so terrible, because there was this -- some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: It

Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: -- better than nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: But there was something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Were people working in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span

then also, Montpellier, you had the Red Cross distributed clothing, and also the -- what was it called?</span> <span id="s1480">Not the [indecipherable], the foundation army distributed clothing over there, too.</span> <span id="s1481">A reg --</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: For -- from the United States that they donated.</span> <span id="s1486">So that’s where we got our first clothes, my brother and me.</span> <span id="s1487">It was like a pillorin they call it, it -- it was a [indecipherable] without sleeves, except it had openings [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Like a poncho.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Exactly, that’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: This was good for rain, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: For you got your hands free.</span> <span id="s1494">You didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Did you get some warm clothes?</span> <span id="s1496">Because it’s winter now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: You know, they had the -- plenty of supplies.</span> <span id="s1500">They had a lot of supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: But they could not bring them into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: They couldn’t bring it into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: No.</span> <span id="s1505">By the way, it was where the camp [indecipherable] in there, there was someone, and we suspect it was an American journalist that was there, and it was behind the barrier that [indecipherable] and the gendarmes were with him, so a few of us made a sign, “Nous avons faim.”</span> <span id="s1506">We are hungry.</span> <span id="s1507">We moved that towards him.</span> <span id="s1508">The gendarmes [indecipherable] too close, and I hope he saw the sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: They didn’t force us to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1514">All right, so 1500 people get -- how many people were in this camp to begin with, do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Thousands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1518">I don’t [indecipherable] thousands -- I’d say probably between three and 4000, probably.</span> <span id="s1519">That means just the women --</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: And were they all -- were they mainly Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: They were Spaniards, and also military, foreign troops like Czechs.</span> <span id="s1524">And I -- I don’t remember [indecipherable] of Polish troops, but they were supposed to go to Africa when Germany won the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: But then they got stuck, there with no ships to take them to Africa, so they put them in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Now, how did people prove that they came to France before 1936?</span> <span id="s1528">Did they -- or did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: You -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: You have a -- you have an entrance pa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: A passport from a -- if you came from foreign countries, or even from France that you had a -- your foreigner card.</span> <span id="s1532">And a foreigner carte étrangère, has a pa -- passport when you came in -- ha-has a card showing when you came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: So the people who came in after 1936 were stuck in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: And then, the worst that happened [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1535">Then they decided to enter the camp and transfer everybody to the camp of Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Which is near the Pyrenees, and there are terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s1538">It was near the sea, and they had the, I guess water running close by a-and the rain and whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: And so the camp commander, Tassart, said, “Well, I’d like to send a delegation of the people to Rivesaltes to see how the conditions are, so they can convince the people in the camp that things are not that bad over there the way [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1541">It was one of those, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1542">There was a Russian general who made fake visitors [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Oh, Potemkin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Potemkin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Potemkin village.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: So they had places over there, and they saw [indecipherable] is, this has flowers over here, and this and that, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1549">Sidewalks and that.</span> <span id="s1550">It was terrible when they got there, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: The food was not good, and that -- the Rivesaltes, th-they had just a few barracks they showed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1554">Now this is after you got out the 1500 people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: -- that they closed Agde and sent them to Rivesaltes, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1558">I know of one of the people that went to -- like, it was part of the [indecipherable] it was called Rubenstein.</span> <span id="s1559">He was from Frankfurt and my parents knew him, and he had a son of our age, too.</span> <span id="s1560">And he was wa -- allowed somehow to come to Montpellier [indecipherable] camp and he went to our house even, but he had to go back to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: But he was one of the guys that was blindsided, I -- you know, just told him hey, it’s so beautiful over here, and they showed him the -- how many things that were favorable to show to -- to the French -- to the internees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1564">Now, bef -- before we get to talking about you father, and y -- because of these razzias and their -- razzias and their picking up people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: You g -- you are going to school, you’re in a suburb of Montpellier in Celleneuve?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Celleneuve, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Celleneuve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: I went to the ORT school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: ORT school, and very --</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: -- in Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1573">And there you learned things that became important for you later, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1575">First of all, I started as a mechanic’s training.</span> <span id="s1576">Forging -- iron forging -- forge is a French word, it’s a -- what do you call it -- you know, where you process hot irons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: And where the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: And then the -- and then I took the class in chemistry, my brother also.</span> <span id="s1581">And that was very interesting, it took a few months [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1582">Exam was very strict.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Because you might think it was from the Sorbonne [indecipherable] Paris [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: It was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: I aced it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span

-- what are you using to make soaps, what are you using to make lipsticks, what are you using to make toothpastes, and all kinds of -- of what do you call that, practical chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: I was going to say it’s very practical chemistry</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: It’s not theoretical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Yes, it -- the instructor was from Poland, and he was -- he trained us.</span> <span id="s1598">He was a -- also a refugee [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1599">He -- I saw him in pa -- in -- in New York when I came back, when I came over here.</span> <span id="s1600">I looked him up in the phone book, and tried to get a job, and he took me to his chemistry factory in Bayonne, and they were -- offered me a job.</span> <span id="s1601">They did not tell me what it was, but when [indecipherable] and I says I wouldn’t accept this job, they wouldn’t pay anything, because the expenses would be higher traveling --</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: -- than they would want to pay you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Now why did you take this course in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: I didn’t want to be idle --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: -- you know, and then the -- I also had the training in mechanical applications, they had the other course being taught the same time a -- the same time, later on, so it was good to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: I like it a lot, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: And when you’re in Celleneuve, you -- you were Jew -- I mean, people knew that you were Jewish,

day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Once a day you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: We had -- you know, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s1644">First of all we had to do the shopping, you had to carry as much as you could and besides, there was the matter of -- these people have money to buy anything, yo -- I mean, we were limited ourselves, so we could not actually -- that was not the case though.</span> <span id="s1645">The primary thing was, it was quite a distance to walk in the village, too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: It was a big distance, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: And do the shopping, and carry it back, you know, it was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: But the people inside the camp would give you money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: And would they ask you to get certain things, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: They d -- they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: And how did you decide who you would w-work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: They asked us, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: They just asked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Because this happened before.</span> <span id="s1658">People went to -- had the authority to go to see a dentist or a doctor, or so, and people asked them, would you please buy me this or that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: So th-that already started before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: So for us it was just a matter of stepping in there and help them out too.</span> <span id="s1663">We had been through these horrible few days, and we were lucky, it was just a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: We felt very badly for those people.</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, when you’re hungry, it’s a terrible feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1668">So you felt responsible to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: So how much -- how long a walk was it from the camp to the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: A few kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: A few kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: And then when you go to the village you have to go to the -- the grocery stores, and you had to get from th-this end, that [indecipherable] different places, you know, so it took time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1677">And you didn’t have gloves, so it was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Our hands were frozen.</span> <span id="s1679">But we did not worry about that because we felt we had to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1681">So it must have been exhausting both psychologically and physically for you folks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: No, psychologically we felt we had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: So this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: This was a must.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: -- this was good.</span> <span id="s1686">And this went on for a number of months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: Til about -- well, til about February or so, when they decide to close the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: So it’s December, January, February, so it is a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Right, yes, it was a few months, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: So it’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Oh we, you know, I have to -- yeah, we were staying in the [indecipherable] when they decided to move the people to Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1696">And then they had to send a delegation to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: To -- to look at the fake part of the camp, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: But after they leave, do they -- do they close the camp in June of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: I believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: In June of 1941 or ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Oh, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Oh yes, I think it -- see, let’s see, June -- I think February was what -- I-I can’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: February ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: I believe in early -- yes, ’41, yes, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1707">It wasn’t too many months after we left.</span> <span id="s1708">I think this was February, or something like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: So when you’re at school, the ORT school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: -- was that in ’41 or ’42, do you -- do you have a -- do you remember at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Not exactly, but I have the certificate so I can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Well, we can check.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: But maybe it’s ’42 that you’re in this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: Well, because I went to different classes, I went to the mechanics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: I went to the other one.</span> <span id="s1719">So the other one was about four or five months prior to the applied chemistry class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: What a class that was, it was -- it was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: It was great?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: I learned an awful lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: But you hadn’t been to school for a few years now, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: So this was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: That wa -- that was th -- that was the end of it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Did you carry around your dictionary with you?</span> <span id="s1731">Is that one of the things you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1735">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: No, huh?</span> <span id="s1737">So it’s good that you had all this dictionary training beforehand, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: So in July and August of 1942, they start these raids, the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Ah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: -- because they’re occupying Vichy, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: No, this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: This is before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: -- before that.</span> <span id="s1745">Because I remember that they had some raids, or rafles [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: -- and before that -- and we located places to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: People to hide with, food.</span> <span id="s1750">My father had this one friend of his who had a restaurant, Tellenbaum, and he provided food.</span> <span id="s1751">The boy scouts went to different donors or so, they collected the food.</span> <span id="s1752">They distributed it to the homes, not on a daily basis, because that would have attracted attention.</span> <span id="s1753">So that every two days or three days, they will bring a supply for a few days, so as not to arouse the people there to see wha -- what goes on there, you know?</span> <span id="s1754">They found abandoned houses like that -- things like that.</span> <span id="s1755">The best place to hide was hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: The food was available.</span> <span id="s1758">You did not have to bring anything in.</span> <span id="s1759">Doctors and nurses cooperated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: They put people in beds, and we -- we were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1762">That was very -- these were -- these were doctors and Red Cross people and -- and nurses, these are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1763">Everybody cooperated.</span> <span id="s1764">Not just -- not just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: But your father arranged all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Well, he got people -- connections, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: But he started it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: So he just keeps going with these ideas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: Because we knew that people were going to be getting arrested, we had to hide them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: But weren’t you vulnerable also?</span> <span id="s1774">Or people just didn’t know who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: We weren’t vulnerable because we knew Ernst.</span> <span id="s1776">He was in charge of police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: At that point.</span> <span id="s1779">Now, the people that lived in the same village as we did, Celleneuve, the daughter was arrested.</span> <span id="s1780">And we tried to get her freed out, couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: But you couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: -- couldn’t [indecipherable] no.</span> <span id="s1783">Then the pers -- the family hid us later on, too.</span> <span id="s1784">This was before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: So s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: No, no, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: This was before the Germans occupied southern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1790">But in Celleneuve there seems to be a lot of help, the people are -- are willing to be very helpful to the people who are vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Well, I’m talking about people who are French citizens basically, because they were not subject to any persecution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Because they were French citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Th-They fall under ’36 law -- 1936 law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: And because it’s unoccupied at that point, they’re not vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Correct, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1799">And so this goes on now for a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Yes, and then the razzias ended the end of -- by August or suppose -- early September, I believe, they stopped.</span> <span id="s1801">Then the allies landed in North Africa on August -- on November eighth, 1942.</span> <span id="s1802">On November 11th [indecipherable] Armistice day for World War І, the Germans invaded France, and then it was time to leave.</span> <span id="s1803">So we go to prefecture, my father and my sister, and they as -- ask for false identification.</span> <span id="s1804">He sends them to a place where a Catholic religious -- religious man -- I’m not sure what they call that, it’s -- it’s an order of the Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s1805">And then they had a period of time where the man -- the [indecipherable] had no contact with the outside.</span> <span id="s1806">He sends my sister and me over there to ask for the false identification.</span> <span id="s1807">We have about four pictures, I didn’t have any of my mom at the time.</span> <span id="s1808">We go there, and the abbey in Chanione d’Aussac, d’Aussac, d‘A-u-s-s-a-c.</span> <span id="s1809">He sees us, he opens the door, he says, for that purpose I am not going to go according [indecipherable] religion.</span> <span id="s1810">This is important, he has to help us.</span> <span id="s1811">Then he sends us to a mail drop, a Catholic library, to pick up the documents over there.</span> <span id="s1812">The document -- the Catholic library was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: So he didn’t know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Oh yes, we -- we told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Because Ernst sent us to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: I guess he must have called -- talk -- telephoned [indecipherable] first, because otherwise he would never [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Otherwise he wouldn’t take you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1823">And then they sent us to librarie Catholic, which is a mail drop for the social security office service of the resistance.</span> <span id="s1824">I didn’t know that at the time.</span> <span id="s1825">And di -- the people working already against the Vichy government and against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: So we go back and pick up the visa -- the cards over there, on the 11th I believe, was the same day or the next day -- next day, probably.</span> <span id="s1828">And then we take a train, and go to Nende, which is in the Lozere mountains.</span> <span id="s1829">[indecipherable] my father had met a gentleman from St-Germain-de-Calbert.</span> <span id="s1830">And we had to go through Nende to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: So, he says, well let’s go to St-Germain-de-Calbert.</span> <span id="s1833">We took a train to Nende, and we stayed in the refugee camp overnight, they have them all over the place, and at five o’clock in the morning, we walk out of camp, and go to the mils -- to the city, and there is a German soldier with fixed bayonet, standing guard in front of a hotel, where the German officers was s-staying.</span> <span id="s1834">We got scared, I mean, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: And there were all of you, it’s the five you walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Is he going to ask for our papers or what, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Well, he was just watching the hotel, it was al -- his job, so we walk by, we go to the railroad station, and from the railroad station we go to the Col de Jalcreste, J-a-l-c-r-e-s-t-e.</span> <span id="s1841">Acor -- it was actually a -- a valley, like a valley.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: And there was a chauffeur, a fellow who did transportation for people, like a taxi, but actually is a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1846">And he takes us to St-Germain-de-Calbert.</span> <span id="s1847">We meet the friend of my father, and he finds a place for us to stay, we rent th-the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: And the German, you’re bypassing the German altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Yes, they are not in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: And they are just on main highway, in Nende, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1852">And well, you know, next day, gendarmes come to the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: The next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Are be -- juif?</span> <span id="s1855">Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s1856">Said no.</span> <span id="s1857">He said, Catholic?</span> <span id="s1858">Are you Catholic?</span> <span id="s1859">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1860">[indecipherable], you know, but [indecipherable] as long as they had orders to record the entrance of any non-resident and see if they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1861">It was the 1936 laws there, misapplied.</span> <span id="s1862">I mean, they -- they went on further than -- than [indecipherable] for anybody.</span> <span id="s1863">So I didn’t walk away --</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Did your papers say that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: I mean not Jewish, Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: It didn’t say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: No.</span> <span id="s1870">The papers we had, and I think I sent you copies with those cards.</span> <span id="s1871">No, there’s just a -- the birthdate, birthplace, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: And your name then was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: Hebergé.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Hebergé.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Hebergé.</span> <span id="s1876">Iberger, depending on the -- who asks, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: My parents say Iberger, we say Hebergé.</span> <span id="s1879">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Okay, so now you’re Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1882">And we, you know [indecipherable] in the village.</span> <span id="s1883">We stay -- first of all we stayed in the hotel, Hotel Martin, that’s in Poland, because that hotel had an annex, we stayed in the annex.</span> <span id="s1884">The hotel itself was already occupied.</span> <span id="s1885">And he was hiding, we didn't know at the time, 24 Jewish people, plus about six or seven other ones who were foreigners, Armenians and other nationalities.</span> <span id="s1886">They were not hiding from the Germans at the time, but were just hiding from the French [indecipherable] I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: But -- so anyway, then we [indecipherable] the sequence.</span> <span id="s1889">I -- I guess we get to meet people over there.</span> <span id="s1890">There was a shoemaker who had the sewing machine -- no, no, the -- the -- we were looking for food, to buy food.</span> <span id="s1891">Well, we had some money and [indecipherable] and some silverware and a -- a tablecloth.</span> <span id="s1892">And they told me that I could probably get food on those items if I go to a farm on the other side of the hill, on the mountain.</span> <span id="s1893">Château de Cremat, C-r-e-m-a-t.</span> <span id="s1894">I go over there and the lady is very nice, and I says, “I came to get some food from you.</span> <span id="s1895">I do not have much money, but I can give you some merchandise in trade.”</span> <span id="s1896">And she said, “Let’s see.”</span> <span id="s1897">And I showed her our silverware.</span> <span id="s1898">Yes, she’s interested.</span> <span id="s1899">I show her the tablecloth, she’s interested.</span> <span id="s1900">You know, before, they were poor, the farms, had not much money to buy those things, and now they have food when people need it, they can get more money, so now they have money to buy things --</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: -- or for trade.</span> <span id="s1903">It was great.</span> <span id="s1904">So I brought home some paté de fois gras.</span> <span id="s1905">They had pigs, they slaughtered since war, a-and geese, so it was great.</span> <span id="s1906">And my parents were really surprised that I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: -- so well.</span> <span id="s1909">I don’t know how -- how I became the -- the shopper for my fa -- family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1911">And besides paté, what did you bring?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Let’s see, paté, potatoes and vegetables, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: -- like th-that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: So the paté was a -- a big luxury.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: Was the main thing, yes.</span> <span id="s1917">But -- it certainly was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: So when you’re staying in the annex of the hotel, did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: Yes, it was just two buildings down the road, with a different entrance and th -- and there’s a passage under -- underneath it, to get into it like a -- a bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: So, do you have a washroom, a shower --</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: A shower?</span> <span id="s1923">You have toilet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1925">They had about 20 some rooms, and the main hotel was all occupied, and so we had the overfill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: And where were these other Jews that you didn’t know about, in the annex also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: In -- in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: -- in the main hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: -- in -- in the main hotel, yes.</span> <span id="s1932">They are the ones that occupied most of the rooms [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: So we -- we met all the people, because the one that we knew had already met most of them, but we never admitted who we were.</span> <span id="s1935">It was obvious we knew each other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: -- we knew who we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: -- and we had common sense not to mention anything or discuss anything.</span> <span id="s1940">So I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: So it’s clearly very dangerous at this point, because the Germans can go anywhere, they ha -- they’re occupying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: We thought too busy occupy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: -- other places, yes, the -- the coast -- coastline because the allies had landed in southern France --</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: -- the coastline.</span> <span id="s1947">So Montpellier, Nieme, those places were more vulnerable, you know, for -- for people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: Because they ordered certain areas evacuated, no civilians could live there, too.</span> <span id="s1950">So it was -- but we were quite a ways from the coast.</span> <span id="s1951">This was our luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: So do you sort of settle down and you now have to get work in order to be able to eat, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1954">I-I am not sure exactly when it started, but I found a job with my father to cut down trees, which were used for the coal mines as support, you know, they have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: -- so the miners can work in -- under there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: So these are big logs that you’re working with, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Pi -- big pine trees.</span> <span id="s1959">And we had to cut down 12, our quota.</span> <span id="s1960">12 pine trees a two -- for two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: 12 a day for each of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: No, two of them, for both of us.</span> <span id="s1963">Remove the branches, remove the bark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: We had a big, long stick with a -- a knife, to remove the bark.</span> <span id="s1966">And, you know, it was a -- a -- trying to saw the tree down with -- we use an ax to make a cut in the tree, a vee shaped ax.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: And then take the hacksaw -- the -- the -- a big, two man saw, cut the other side and make sure the tree falls o-on the right s -- o-on the side not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: So you ha -- you have to do it on the right side, otherwise you’re in big trouble, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1971">And that was quite heavy work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Now, where was your brother?</span> <span id="s1973">You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: He was working in the farm where I had the -- made the exchange for the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1976">So you and your father got the heavy work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: We were lucky, because there we got paid.</span> <span id="s1978">On the other side he -- he just got so-some food, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: He got some food, but he didn’t get paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: He got the food for the work for himself and very little to -- to take home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: And where is your sister and your mother at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: My sister went to work in a -- in the Catholic lady who had the garden.</span> <span id="s1983">Now, this could have been a problem.</span> <span id="s1984">What happened, she was very religious and she asked my sister for a baptism paper.</span> <span id="s1985">My sister says, well, we are in Alsace, we don’t have anything here [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1986">There is no way for us to get it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: That was [indecipherable] likely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: And that was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Boy, but she was really strict on -- on -- on that, because she would have a -- a Catholic person working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: The -- my mom was home most of the time.</span> <span id="s1993">And we used to go someplace out, my father and I, to harvest mushrooms after rain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: We didn’t know much about the mushrooms, but we [indecipherable] people, and the tourists take only one type, it’s an orange type.</span> <span id="s1996">And if you go take this only, you won’t go wrong.</span> <span id="s1997">[indecipherable] get poisoned.</span> <span id="s1998">So we did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: And did you do that in order to sell these mushrooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: To -- just to eat them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: I had -- I had food, you know, on the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: And your mother wa -- your mother was doing the cooking, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: And you know what?</span> <span id="s2007">She was terrific.</span> <span id="s2008">She always knew we did not have enough food, she says, here is little more, here, this.</span> <span id="s2009">I said, “But it’s your food, don’t.”</span> <span id="s2010">She said, “No, I’m not hungry.”</span> <span id="s2011">You know how mothers are.</span> <span id="s2012">You will say no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: So she -- she didn’t eat as much as she could have, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Did you see her lose weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: We all lost weight [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: You di -- you all lost weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: But you know, it was terrible, because we didn't want to take her food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: We were hungry and we knew that she was hungry too, so we tried to refuse as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: But she always said, no, take this one, spoonful of this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2026">Fred, tell me something.</span> <span id="s2027">What were you hearing about what was happening outside of France?</span> <span id="s2028">Were you hearing about killing centers, were you hearing about shooting -- you</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: No -- oh.</span> <span id="s2030">That was ki -- we didn’t know until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: -- you didn’t -- you didn’t know until after.</span> <span id="s2032">Nothing</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: You just knew that the Germans were after the Jews, but you didn’t know why, what they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: No, [indecipherable] not, no.</span> <span id="s2036">We knew only they were arresting them, they were putting them in camps, resettling them in the towns, the whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: [indecipherable] be able to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: So no rumors came to you, nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: No, nothing at all.</span> <span id="s2041">Not even I guess in the rest of France.</span> <span id="s2042">We were [indecipherable] we never heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: And the rest of France didn’t hear about it, either.</span> <span id="s2045">Because they said that we are going to repay them for country -- for [indecipherable] land.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: You know, for food [indecipherable] different jobs and whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: And that’s all.</span> <span id="s2049">So I suppose in some way it was fortunate that you didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: Because your spirits would not -- so de -- as depressed as it might have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: Oh no, right.</span> <span id="s2053">I mean, we -- we knew we could -- we had to avoid them because of what they did to -- to my uncles, they killed them, yeah.</span> <span id="s2054">Although we did not know about the second one, he -- we -- we -- he wasn’t at camp when we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: So we didn’t know about what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2057">But there was shoemaker in town, and he had the sewing machine, so it broke down, so my father offered to fix it for him.</span> <span id="s2058">Then he said, you know, I got some blankets, I would like to make some pants on it.</span> <span id="s2059">And the guy [indecipherable] sew pants -- pants.</span> <span id="s2060">And then they traded it for food for the farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: So how did your father have all these skills?</span> <span id="s2062">All of a sudden he’s making pants?</span> <span id="s2063">He’d never done that be --</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: It doesn’t have to be fancy, it was for a farmer who was working the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: Well still, but I have to tell you that if you gave me a sewing machine and material, I don’t think I could sew a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s2066">Could you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: So your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: Yeah, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: He did.</span> <span id="s2074">And he traded it for food.</span> <span id="s2075">And I told you about the tobacco exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: That lady was so grateful because soap was also rationed, it was hard to get.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: And now she could wash the floors and -- and all that.</span> <span id="s2080">She was so happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Were you able to make soap for people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Well, I for -- just for her I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: Just for this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: Because you need other stuff, you need [indecipherable] you needed sodium, you needed sodium, potassium, all kinds of minerals, you need also an indicator of the -- if it’s a si -- acidic or -- or [indecipherable] whatever, you know, it’s -- the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: I forgot what it’s called now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: And so who -- to -- for whom were you making this soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Just for that one lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: And who was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: She owned the tobacco shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Ah, she owned the toba -- and she would exchange it for tobacco, and then you would go and exchange the tobacco --</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: For food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: For food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Because tobacco was rationed too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: But she somehow had connections where she had more than just rations.</span> <span id="s2099">And she had plenty in reserve too, because they were all appo -- supposedly si -- report, it said the instruction on hand.</span> <span id="s2100">I’m sure she had enough, so had more than she needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Did other people find out that you were making soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: She mentioned something about I’m making soap, and she [indecipherable] that was an exchange of tobacco.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: So you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: I didn’t want the police to find out either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: The gendarmes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: But -- but your class was very helpful then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2109">It saved our necks.</span> <span id="s2110">I mean, we had food for whatever time that we had food, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2112">So how hungry were you, Fred?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: Very, very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: You were very hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s2116">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2117">The rations that you get officially, were very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: We had maybe a half a pound of bread a day, I think it was half pound or a quarter of a pound of bread a day.</span> <span id="s2120">And you had a half of pound of sugar for the whole month.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Per person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Per person.</span> <span id="s2123">It wasn’t -- I don’t think it was even a half a pound.</span> <span id="s2124">Or maybe a quarter of a pound.</span> <span id="s2125">It was a very little, it -- it was o -- small cubes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2126">Oil was very rare.</span> <span id="s2127">You were entitled to it but you wouldn’t get it, because it was not available.</span> <span id="s2128">Milk was only for children and babies, you know.</span> <span id="s2129">Coffee was ersatz coffee, not very tasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Re -- well, now the main thing we did especially, we went to farms and bought vegetables, carrots, rutabaga.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Rutabaga.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: [indecipherable] I never see one, too soon.</span> <span id="s2134">[indecipherable] like Jerusalem artichokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: Artichokes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: But th-they call them something else over there.</span> <span id="s2137">And it was a different sh -- shape, it was a -- this is -- looks almost like over here, but it was not the same thing.</span> <span id="s2138">But the rutabaga -- the rutabaga, that was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: So when you say they were -- they were rationing, that means that everybody in the area was presumably going to get the same food, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Yes, except those who grew their own, farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Had more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Had more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Those -- the trade they did with the -- the same thing, trading, you know.</span> <span id="s2145">I had the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: -- the cousins -- their cousins and [indecipherable] and what that they -- they [indecipherable] for them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: So if you were good at trading, you had more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: If you had more to trade with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: If -- and if you had more to trade with, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: But most people -- would you say that most people were really suffering during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: Not those people there, no.</span> <span id="s2154">The refugees, yes.</span> <span id="s2155">The local people had the chicken, they had the eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: So they had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: They have surely enough, they had a small garden --</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: So it was the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Yeah, and then next thing is -- is that you had big black market going on too.</span> <span id="s2160">So the people came from the towns, bought things at high prices, raised the prices for us too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: And we couldn’t afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: Now there’s one interesting thing happened, it was one of the underground movements, that was later on a different group was looking for food.</span> <span id="s2165">They went to see this farmer and he sold them food at exorbitant prices.</span> <span id="s2166">Then the commanding officer [indecipherable] took out his pistol, and says okay, let’s have the money back.</span> <span id="s2167">He said, we paid you, you charge exorbitant prices.</span> <span id="s2168">Then he took a box of matches, stuck the match -- the money into the fire.</span> <span id="s2169">He says, that’s for you, you get nothing.</span> <span id="s2170">But you got paid, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: It’s very clever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: There was a lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: He didn’t overcharge any more, and he got [indecipherable] his business too.</span> <span id="s2175">They learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: I think we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Fred, you were mentioning to me about checks that you were receiving that you still don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Who sent them, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: Who sent them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: We were in the small village of St-Germain-de-Calbert, and from time to time, for a period of time they came every month, and then they stopped.</span> <span id="s2183">The only people I remember in France that could have possibly send me one is a cousin of my parents who had been in service, got married, and lived, I believe, in Lyon.</span> <span id="s2184">But I was never able to identify this because the sending station was different.</span> <span id="s2185">The -- the -- the place from where they s-send the checks.</span> <span id="s2186">And the other [indecipherable] was, if possible, I understood that maybe some Jewish organization may have been aware of our existence, and they did not put their name on it.</span> <span id="s2187">I understand they had some resources in Switzerland, the -- I forgot what the name of the organization was -- and they could have possibly done that for a period of time, but I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: But you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: No.</span> <span id="s2190">It was welcome, because we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: I bet it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: -- exhausted [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: How did it come to you?</span> <span id="s2194">It wouldn’t come to your place, would it?</span> <span id="s2195">How did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: Well, they picked them up -- I guess we had to pick them up at the post office --</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: At the post office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: -- which was about half a block away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2200">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Speaking about post office --</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Did I tell you that they censored some letters that were sent out from St-Germain-de-Calbert?</span> <span id="s2204">I found out afterwards.</span> <span id="s2205">If those letters were sent to a German authority, or a French police authority, they just tore them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: They tore them up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: They [indecipherable] tore up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: And this was because the resistance was working in various places in that small town, but you didn’t -- you didn’t know this at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: No, I found out afterwards through the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: -- somes of -- books that I read.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: There’s an incident where police come, or SS come, I don’t know who it is, comes to your house and they look through the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: And -- but they miss what would have been very revealing, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2216">And this was an incident that occurred on April seventh, 1942, in the village -- or north of the village of san -- St-Etienne Vallee Française.</span> <span id="s2217">And what happened is, this one [indecipherable] was a hard to get along fellow, apparently, who wouldn’t take orders from nobody, and he had a car parked in the street.</span> <span id="s2218">And some of the local people saw that there was a submachine gun on the back seat.</span> <span id="s2219">So they told him to take it away, and he refused, just for spite.</span> <span id="s2220">And what happened, shortly thereafter, a car with four -- I -- I was told -- Gestapo or Wehrmacht, [indecipherable] taken by.</span> <span id="s2221">I’m not sure which it is.</span> <span id="s2222">Anyway, they saw that submachine gun on the back seat, and wanted to find out whose it was.</span> <span id="s2223">Then this [indecipherable] from the resistance came out, and with this man, and they killed three of them on the spot.</span> <span id="s2224">I hear from other sources they were killed two on the spot, one tried to escape, and was shot under a bridge where he had hidden, and the fourth one was captured and they hanged him on the gate of a chateau in the same division.</span> <span id="s2225">A few days later a -- two companies of the Ost Leon, these are the Russians [indecipherable] the Polish troops in the German army, the legion of the east, came by from Marda, and came through our village.</span> <span id="s2226">And [indecipherable] police came Feldgendarmie, with big metal [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2227">And they knocked on the door at about one, two o’clock in the morning with the rifle butts.</span> <span id="s2228">I opened up the door and they come in, and the leaders says terrorishn.</span> <span id="s2229">Are there any terrorists here?</span> <span id="s2230">My father says, “Il n’ya pas terrorists.”</span> <span id="s2231">Then they say, raffen.</span> <span id="s2232">We understand every single word they’re saying because they’re speaking German and we understand it.</span> <span id="s2233">My father ignores it, “Qu’est ce que c’est raffen?”</span> <span id="s2234">So the guy does this with his rifle.</span> <span id="s2235">My father says, “No, Il na pas.”</span> <span id="s2236">Then they searched the house.</span> <span id="s2237">On top of closets, all the doors, the kitchen, every room.</span> <span id="s2238">And there’s a big overseas trunk in one of the rooms, bedroom.</span> <span id="s2239">They open it up -- one of the -- one of the guys open up.</span> <span id="s2240">They went different directions, every one had a different assignment.</span> <span id="s2241">He opens it up, and there’s a drawer of like, shirts, under which we had our talleissim and Tefillin.</span> <span id="s2242">Luckily for us, he never lifted that tray.</span> <span id="s2243">Had he lifted it, we would have been dead.</span> <span id="s2244">So he says, “Nicht viel.”</span> <span id="s2245">Not much.</span> <span id="s2246">He closes the cover and goes on looking for more weapons or other things, i-in the whole house.</span> <span id="s2247">Another one of them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: May I ask you something?</span> <span id="s2249">Isn’t it odd that he didn’t lift up -- everybody knows that there’s a -- a tray.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s2252">You just lift it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: He didn’t lift it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: Do you think he did that on purpose?</span> <span id="s2255">You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">A: Maybe he was tired already from, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: -- because they had probably a long day [indecipherable] those -- reason, because they had to travel quite a bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: -- to come to the house, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: So this very strange, I mean, it saved our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: And a-another one had came into the kitchen, and the radio was there on the table, so he says, “Radio?”</span> <span id="s2265">I says, “Ce marche pas.”</span> <span id="s2266">It doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s2267">Well, he doesn’t listen, he turns it on.</span> <span id="s2268">Maybe he didn’t understand French anyway.</span> <span id="s2269">So he turns it on and there’s a crackling noise because it wasn’t functioning.</span> <span id="s2270">He shuts it down.</span> <span id="s2271">Then he sees two dictionaries on the table, one French-German, and one French-English.</span> <span id="s2272">So he points to the English one, he says, “This good, das yeah.”</span> <span id="s2273">So I nod my head.</span> <span id="s2274">He walks away.</span> <span id="s2275">Meantime I have a dog barking in the backyard, and I had to quiet him down because he was waking up the neighborhood, too.</span> <span id="s2276">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: Was that your dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Did you have a dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: Yeah, a small one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2283">That dog was important because he helped us bring a lady from Martin a few miles away, she was expecting.</span> <span id="s2284">And we had to take her to the house to bring her to -- to the Protestant minister who took care of her to go to the hospital, a Jewish woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: And how did the dog help?</span> <span id="s2286">A: When the dogs came -- when we pass in the night [indecipherable] there, dogs are barking all over the place, and he never answered back, as if he knew, you know.</span> <span id="s2287">Otherwise he would have give us -- gived us away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2289">So when did you get the dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: When did you get the dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: Oh, I don’t recall the exact time, but he was with us for o-over a year or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2295">Now, the other German checked under the stairway, and there was a spot there where they stored normally vegetables, you know, potatoes or whatnot.</span> <span id="s2296">And he looks in there with his flashlight, doesn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s2297">Behind a sheerai -- a wax cloth, we had hidden our false identity -- ar -- our true identity cards.</span> <span id="s2298">And he does not see nothing, it matches the color of the rest of the [indecipherable] and he walks out.</span> <span id="s2299">So two chance --</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: That’s pretty scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2302">And then they walk out, we were very calm, and then we collapse.</span> <span id="s2303">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Once they walked out you collapsed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Oh God, yes.</span> <span id="s2306">That was hel -- horrible.</span> <span id="s2307">We were very close to getting killed there.</span> <span id="s2308">Turned out [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Do you think they would have just killed you on the spot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: Probably not, but they would bring us to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: The same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: And that would have been -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: Because they would have probably tortured you to try to find out what else you know, who else you know, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: Did you think of, after this incident, putting all of these things that could reveal who you are someplace else?</span> <span id="s2316">Bury them or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Well, what happened is, in the building there was a workshop with a dirt floor.</span> <span id="s2318">And I had buried those papers in there months before.</span> <span id="s2319">But we were on the side of a hill, and when it rained, the water accumulated, the sand was washed out, and the papers were shown.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: That’s why I took them from there and hid them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s2323">So did you leave them in the house after this, still?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: I don’t recall for sure, but we had not much of a choice [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s2325">But we had tried to escape from there, the back wall had the stones -- a stone wall actually, with spaces in between, and we tried to put in cap -- a couple hooks so we could walk out there.</span> <span id="s2326">Luckily we didn’t try, because there were soldiers out there, too.</span> <span id="s2327">And if we had, we’d be dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: So a -- I see, it wouldn’t have worked.</span> <span id="s2329">Did you know that there was a lot -- there were a lot of people in the resistance in this area, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Nobody talked very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: Nobody talked that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: The less we knew, the better off we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: As a matter of fact, my brother almost got shot.</span> <span id="s2335">You know, the Germans were taking people from a certain age [indecipherable] 20 - 21 and 22 for forced labor to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: And it -- you have young people came up from the vi -- cities to hide up there.</span> <span id="s2338">I found out after my brother was killed in combat that there was a group of the resistance that was lying in ambush for him one time, they wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s2339">Why?</span> <span id="s2340">He came to work from the one farm where he worked, and they thought that the only reason he was in the open and not being bothered by the police or so is because he must have been collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2341">But the reason was that we were passing for Alsatians, and there was an agreement between France and -- and als -- and the Germans, Alsatians who were -- some of them were Ger-Germans, some of them were French, should not be forced to work f -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s2342">So this one guy from o -- well, this is [indecipherable] later on told me that we stopped them from killing your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: So tell me something, how does it happen that you and Max go into the resistance?</span> <span id="s2344">What -- what circumstances s-so that you could get in there in the first place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: Well, the resistance rep -- s-single people that were hiding in different places, farms [indecipherable], after awhile they got organized, and then they got uniforms.</span> <span id="s2346">They broke into a uniform factory in Saint Jean Lugar, with the complicity of the owner.</span> <span id="s2347">He says they broke in and they took so many uniforms.</span> <span id="s2348">Once they got a uniform, they figure it’s about time we should join them guys, too.</span> <span id="s2349">This is not -- think of us as a -- a -- either against them, or not going to do anything for -- for France.</span> <span id="s2350">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: But how did you know that that was the resistance?</span> <span id="s2352">A: How did I know the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: Yeah, how did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: Because they stayed in a building just south of the village, maybe a few hundred feet south from there, which was supposed to be a camp for Chantiers de jeunesse.</span> <span id="s2355">This was Marshall Pittens idea of taking young people and organizing them for future Frenchmen, you know, o-of -- of his kibo and thing.</span> <span id="s2356">[indecipherable] too.</span> <span id="s2357">So we said that -- and they came up and they had roadblocks on the main highway, so we decided let’s -- let’s join them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Now, did you talk -- talk about this with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: You just did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: Were you living with your parents at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: Yes, oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: And did they know that you were involved, or didn’t they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: No, well they -- they found out, because as soon as we applied there, the guys -- we were g -- on guard duty, y-you know, so many hours of the day --</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: -- hours of the night.</span> <span id="s2368">And then we got uniforms too, like they were wearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: So then they found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: It’s a khaki unif -- jacket and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: -- brown pants, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: And were they unhappy that you were doing this, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: Oh, they were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: They were happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: Because of just -- they -- who, my parents, or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: Your -- your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: Oh, my parents.</span> <span id="s2379">They had the doubts about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: They had doubts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: But you know, we had made a decision.</span> <span id="s2382">We could not be in [indecipherable] and people not knowing if they are on one side or the other side, and that could have been very costly for us sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: So w -- did this mean that your parents were not safe?</span> <span id="s2384">Or were they safer because you were in the resistance?</span> <span id="s2385">Or didn’t it matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: Well, the people in the village treat us like somebody apart to some extent, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: So that you were strangers --</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: -- the parents, they were like strangers to -- to some extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Until we joined them, the resistance, everything is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: So they knew which side you were on, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: Yes, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: There was one villager there who had the son in the French milice, which was the most cruel terrorists of the French government that took the resistance people and killed them and tortured them and do everything to them.</span> <span id="s2395">And the neighbors warned by an anonymous letter, hand carried to them at night -- not to them, to the house, that they better shape up and get their son out of the area.</span> <span id="s2396">So you know, we do take [indecipherable] the situation, too.</span> <span id="s2397">It -- not knowing who we were, what we were doing, did not help in that case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: But let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2399">How do you actually -- why did they even trust you?</span> <span id="s2400">You just went up to them and say we want to join you?</span> <span id="s2401">I mean, what did -- wh-what did you actually do to join?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: Well, some of these were actually local inhabitants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Some were from the other cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: So the local ones were, like I said, the one guy told these -- the other commander not to shoot my son, so, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: -- they realized he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: They -- they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: -- they did not know, but they were not out to do something unfortunate that could not be corrected.</span> <span id="s2411">So, I mean when we said we -- okay, we’d like to join you and help you, stay on duty, and guard duty, whatnot, they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: That was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Did they know you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s2415">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">Q: Did they ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">A: That’s just -- that -- no, that’s the whole point.</span> <span id="s2419">Because we were not Jewish officially to them, then who are we?</span> <span id="s2420">We are Alsatians.</span> <span id="s2421">What are you doing in the mountains?</span> <span id="s2422">How come you don’t [indecipherable] as us, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: There was a lot of questions that could be asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: And I guess they accepted what we [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: So, when you weren't doing guard duty at night or doing something at night, did you go back home to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: And your father at this point is doing what?</span> <span id="s2432">He’s -- he’s working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: He was not working at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: He wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: No.</span> <span id="s2436">And we had the case where I mentioned to you about the sheepherder who had 300 sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: And rather than the ge -- the Germans take it all, he took them to the -- our resistance group, and we ate sheep for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s2439">Mutton.</span> <span id="s2440">But he -- also -- they also decided to give the parents of the resistance there food, for the sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: So that helped too, you know, so th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: And who slaughtered the sheep, the resistance and gave them food -- I mean ho -- how did it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: Well, they had the sheep in some farm, and [indecipherable] he had 300 sheep --</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: But anyway, every so often they took a sheep on, and took it -- you know, killed it, and -- and -- and divide it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: The food out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: -- [indecipherable] among parents of the -- the guys in the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2450">So, did your parents then have more food than they had before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: Well they had no -- no -- no meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: But they ha -- now they had meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: And is your sister working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2457">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: Ah -- we -- she works working for that one lady that wanted to have the certificate of baptism, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: She was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: But was she getting some money, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: She was just getting some food while she was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: I don’t even if that -- it’s just the idea of, you know, keeping busy, and then people know what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: So your -- your parents and your sister are not in a great position at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: So did you and Max think that being in the resistance would be helpful, then?</span> <span id="s2472">I mean, is that one of the reasons why --</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: No, we -- the Germans, more than the people that were in the resistance in a -- in St-Germain-de-Calbert, they had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s2474">They could disappear and even if they caught, well, they would ship them to Germany to do hard work, labor, you know.</span> <span id="s2475">Us they would kill, so we had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: So you felt you had nothing to lose by doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: Exactly right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: And -- and we also -- to take vengeance for the killing of our relatives.</span> <span id="s2480">I mean, this very [indecipherable] knew of.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2482">Did you feel in the resistance group that you were French or you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s2483">Was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">A: French.</span> <span id="s2485">French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">Q: French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: Because I had to play the game for all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: And you -- and you really felt that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: Why --</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: Or was this your -- your mask?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: No, because I still knew why we were there under false names, that we were going to get killed as [indecipherable] so certainly the fact that I consider myself Jewish was definitely present.</span> <span id="s2492">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2494">That was -- that was present, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: So were you immediately when you got into the resistance, were you trained right away, or did that take awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: No, because we had no weapons at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q: And this is -- is this ’42 or ’43?</span> <span id="s2499">This ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: ’43 -- ’44 almost.</span> <span id="s2501">Because the resistance include everybody who was hiding from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: Whether they were active or not, it included those who were put in the reserve to get organized eventually, to be f -- in formations, and be supplied with weapons, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: And what happens is Germans had issued orders to the city halls to create all weapons from the civilians.</span> <span id="s2506">They want you to turn in the weapons.</span> <span id="s2507">And so it either may have mentioned what’s the -- they need weapons, so where do you get them?</span> <span id="s2508">City hall.</span> <span id="s2509">That’s where they were hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2511">So you went and stole them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: Broke in, with the complicity of the mayor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: -- and his assistant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: The knew about it.</span> <span id="s2517">They just complained about it, but the only problem was that the weapons were of all types, ammunition was all mixture.</span> <span id="s2518">It was difficult to have the right ammunition for the right rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: And if you had wrong bullet, you jammed the rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: And it’s useless.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: So what’d you do?</span> <span id="s2524">You kept trying to find the right one for the right --</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: Yes, we -- we managed to free up the jammed rifles, too, but this was dangerous too because it can explode in your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2527">So was there someone there to train -- you had never had a gun in your hand before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: I had been at the Collège Bartholdi in Colmar --</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">A: And on Thursdays we had training for [indecipherable] preparation.</span> <span id="s2531">We didn’t do very much there, but we learned how to shoot a rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: Oh, you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: The first time I shot rifle, they told me, this is the target there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: -- and they said aim in such and such a way, just below, and I did.</span> <span id="s2536">And there was a guy next to me who hated me, I don’t know for what reason.</span> <span id="s2537">He says, “Ha, ha, ha, you couldn’t touch the side of a barn.”</span> <span id="s2538">And the inspect -- the instructor says, “Wait a second.”</span> <span id="s2539">He goes over.</span> <span id="s2540">“He hit right in the center.”</span> <span id="s2541">And was he embarrassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: Yeah, I bet he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: That was an accident, I mean, I may not have hit the center again, but that time I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: Did you feel comfortable around weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: And was that mainly because you -- y-you knew who the enemy was, or does --</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: Yes, exactly, because it gave me a chance to use them to fight back.</span> <span id="s2550">Not necessarily to attack them, because we were outnumbered, but at least to defend ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: And that was very important for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2554">Huh.</span> <span id="s2555">So when was it that Aaron Bank came into your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: About end of July, he was parachuted as a part of a Jedburgh team.</span> <span id="s2557">That’s J-e-d-b-u-r-g-h.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: And what does that mean, Jedburgh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: It’s a -- Jedburgh is a name of a castle out in Scotland.</span> <span id="s2560">And they were trained over there in groups of three, usually in the [indecipherable] an officer or non-com, who spoke the language of the country in which they were parachuted into, because it landed in Belgium, Holland, France, Yugoslavia, different places, so they had to have somebody who spoke the local language.</span> <span id="s2561">And the third one was a radio operator.</span> <span id="s2562">And the -- the point was for them, first of all, to recognize -- to reconnoiter, to find out where the German troops were, their strength, what were good objectives to destroy in case of an invasion to block roads and whatnot.</span> <span id="s2563">We were started on the use of a plastic explosives, which was a new thing at the time.</span> <span id="s2564">We were trained in using gammon hand grenades, there was a special type of hand grenades that they brought to us.</span> <span id="s2565">That’s just training, we did not get any of the weapons right away, though, because it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: You got no other weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: You -- you got no weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: Not right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Not right away, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: There was just the training.</span> <span id="s2572">And th-then the Jedburgh team drove around to get acquainted with the various maquis, where they were located, to look for positions, what was important to destroy to prevent Germans from il -- attacking, or reinforcing troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: And then, after that they had time in August, to train us.</span> <span id="s2575">So Bank came back and trained us in the use of the plastic explosives and they gave us rifles, German, Italian and Russian rifles.</span> <span id="s2576">Why these rifles?</span> <span id="s2577">Those are the ones that -- the Italian rifles were captured in Africa, North Africa, in Libya, I believe.</span> <span id="s2578">The German rifles were captured over there too, possibly or in Italy, and the Russian rifles were captured in Russia.</span> <span id="s2579">Since the Germans used -- and other Russian troops, and the German army, I guess they were forced into the service.</span> <span id="s2580">They had Ru-Russian drivers there, too.</span> <span id="s2581">So the problem was that the ammunition was all different in each of the rifles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: The ammunition was different?</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2584">You could not use one with -- in the other rifles, and that was a big problem.</span> <span id="s2585">The reason for giving us those weapons too, was the fact that in case of bad weather, they cannot parachute or re-supply us, so they have to have a source of constant re-supply, and the best thing [indecipherable] to the Germans and take their weapons --</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: -- and ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: So were these parachuted in, the weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: The weapons were -- some were parachuted in, the heavy weapons like the French, the heavy machine guns --</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: The Hotchkiss machines gu -- machine guns.</span> <span id="s2592">Some American Browning machine guns, and basically the -- the heavy stuff was parachuted in there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: And Aaron Bank also parachuted in to this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s2595">Well, he parachuted before the equipment, way before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2597">Now why would he parachute into that area?</span> <span id="s2598">Was it known that there were a lot of maquis in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: Well, there were many of those teams parachuted in all over France, and even in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: So it was just a matter of seeing -- they were prepared for the landing in North Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: This happened in August.</span> <span id="s2604">The landing happened on August 16th, if I remember correctly, in 1940 -- si -- ’44.</span> <span id="s2605">So, he had to be in place to find out how the Germans were reacting to the landing, if they were sending troops from different areas, and [indecipherable], especially they had two SS Panzer divisions, plank regiments in the area.</span> <span id="s2606">One was the ninth German Panzer division, the other one was the 11th Hohenstauffen Panzer division.</span> <span id="s2607">And they wanted to make sure that they cannot attack the allied -- allied troops landing in southern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: So we should be able to block them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: Block them how?</span> <span id="s2612">Mainly by putting [indecipherable] down and blowing them up.</span> <span id="s2613">See, it would not block the Germans, but it would slow them down.</span> <span id="s2614">They have to remove the trees and whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: And it was just a matter of getting in time, while the allies were landing their troops in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: Okay, we -- we need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: So, y-you are with Aaron Bank being trained during the spring of 1944, the early summer of 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: In August.</span> <span id="s2625">In August, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: In August.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: Yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">Q: So how long are you in the resistance before you get this training, do you think?</span> <span id="s2629">Six months, three months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2631">He -- when he parachuted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">A: -- in August, on the 16th he came down.</span> <span id="s2634">A few days later he trained us, and we went into c-combat on the 21st.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: No, I understand that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: -- but you joined the resistance before Aaron Bank came into the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: Yes, yes, i-in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: In June?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: Yes, but because we were hidden also, this is all part of the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: Those who were hiding were actually being organized because people in town send them to the mountains to hide in farms and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">A: But that was in preparation of regrouping them and arming them afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: So the resistance was actually considered in the [indecipherable] region [indecipherable] as the fifth of -- I guess in the fifth of May, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: So it’s a different sort of a concept of resistance, that actually something’s happening that in a way you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">A: Right, the fer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: Right, they’re -- they’re putting you all together to try and get you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: Yes, and yi -- I -- it was never to exceed a certain number of people at any spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: You -- the maximum they want us to be is maybe 30 at one place, in one location.</span> <span id="s2653">If you had too many people in one area, then the Germans would become interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: And they would try to have big forces surrounding you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: So how many people were in your group, about 20, or was there more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: We were in the -- our group, 20.</span> <span id="s2658">The first was retrained by bake -- by Banker -- Bank, Colonel Bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: And we were then as-assigned a hundred more from a different company that -- from those who were [indecipherable] were joining us, and they never received the tr-training from him, they were thrown in the battle without training, with us.</span> <span id="s2661">So we were the ones who attacked first, and [indecipherable] to pull back with, and be there to get [indecipherable] for the whole regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: I mean for the whole company.</span> <span id="s2664">And then we divide ourselves to be mixed with the other ones, so we were supporting them and showing them, you know, not to run, a-a-and -- and they had confidence just because we had the training [indecipherable] that way.</span> <span id="s2665">And we are not as a single unit then together, we were divided in combat.</span> <span id="s2666">We mixed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: With -- with these other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">Q: But you’re trained by Colonel Banks for a few days, that’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: That’s all.</span> <span id="s2671">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: And then you were supposed to be organized well enough to go in to battle of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: So a few days after you get trained, you’re actually in your first battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: Our very first in August, we were in battle.</span> <span id="s2676">That’s when I led the one group there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2678">You want to explain what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">A: Yes, okay.</span> <span id="s2680">About 16th or 17th of August, oh I -- I [indecipherable] there, we went down from the mountains towards Alès, the city of Alès.</span> <span id="s2681">We stopped at a place called genearagues, g-e-n-e-a-r-a-g-u-e-s, and we’re in the best position to report any activities, Germans and so forth.</span> <span id="s2682">And this was the Saturday, on Sunday morning the people from th -- from Alès came by, they want to go swimming in the river not too far from there, and they see we are resistance in uniform, and say, you know, a group is coming in behind us, and those people -- there is one young lady, she’s 17 years old, her boyfriend is a militia, a traitor that is -- was working for [indecipherable], and those are the people that killed the si -- the resistance people.</span> <span id="s2683">So I am on guard duty there, and I stop her, ask for her name [indecipherable] and I arrest her right away, and I turned her over to the gendarmes.</span> <span id="s2684">They were in Alès [indecipherable] too.</span> <span id="s2685">They [indecipherable] her -- then questioned her, and then they searched her, and she has a pistol.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: Yeah, and it was in her chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: In her -- in her -- in her bra?</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: Mm-hm, a small pistol in her bra.</span> <span id="s2690">And they kept her overnight because we did not want to have reports back that the resistance over here.</span> <span id="s2691">They release her the next day.</span> <span id="s2692">Her boyfriend was captured by a Communist group two -- three days later.</span> <span id="s2693">He admitted that he belonged to the militia and he was being paid 3000 francs a month, but he claimed to have resigned two, three months ago.</span> <span id="s2694">And I had to report this to my captain in my report, and I understand that they killed him, but I have no proof of that.</span> <span id="s2695">I was told that they shot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: A-Anyway, then they had -- on the 21st, we were told that the civilians -- civilian population in Alès had risen up against the Germans, and the Germans had killed eight or nine of them in the city streets.</span> <span id="s2698">Well, they send us [indecipherable] to -- to reinforce.</span> <span id="s2699">We were about 30 in that position.</span> <span id="s2700">So now we [indecipherable] our groups.</span> <span id="s2701">We were going up tr -- on a truck first, on th -- one machine gun, and we were at Alès, the Germans had left, because I guess they may have received orders to retreat and combine with some other units.</span> <span id="s2702">So my captain -- my lieutenant -- there was a -- there was a re -- assigned different positions to some of the guys.</span> <span id="s2703">And me he puts on a pors -- on a [indecipherable] road, he says, report to me if there’s anything abnormal happening over here, and he goes into reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s2704">Well, I didn’t know where the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2705">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: No cell phones, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: No, no cell phones.</span> <span id="s2708">So civilians come back.</span> <span id="s2709">The French flag is all over the city.</span> <span id="s2710">And they said you -- the Germans are coming back there, and the [indecipherable] Alès about 10 kilometers sou -- south of Alès.</span> <span id="s2711">I said, oh my God, with the French flag all over the place.</span> <span id="s2712">We can’t inform everybody at one time to remove them all at once.</span> <span id="s2713">We are not strong enough to have a street fight with them, with the Germans that are come in.</span> <span id="s2714">What’s the alternative?</span> <span id="s2715">So we decided we have to attack them.</span> <span id="s2716">And I made the decision, there was nobody in charge, and I so -- took the guys, and because I just took that action, they did not question it, and they base -- my fa -- father’s trait.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: I was going to say, you’re just like your father, right, but you were no -- you were what, 19?</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: 19, yes, in ‘40 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: Yeah, yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2721">So then I take th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: And this is your first --</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">A: Combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: First combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: Combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: There were 10 guys over there, and I had to take them with me.</span> <span id="s2728">They did not question.</span> <span id="s2729">And then five civilians come over too, to say they want to go with me.</span> <span id="s2730">I says fine.</span> <span id="s2731">We had stationed -- we had been stationed in a school that the Germans had abandoned, but they had left a whole bunch of hand grenades and other equipment there.</span> <span id="s2732">So I gave the five civilians a hand grenade each, a potato masher, it’s called.</span> <span id="s2733">And I took my men in the car -- no, in the truck.</span> <span id="s2734">There were some Communists that decided to join us too.</span> <span id="s2735">I said, okay, come along.</span> <span id="s2736">So they pile in too, we go to [indecipherable] Alès, to find that on the [indecipherable] there, the one, the pyramid, did you ever hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: I didn’t see a pyramid on the -- on your pictures today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: No, but that came after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: No, no, I mean, I didn’t see it today, you have -- you don’t have it with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">A: Oh, I [indecipherable] make sure, okay.</span> <span id="s2743">Anyway, this is where they have the machine gun that was nine by two, the Communists, that their leader had left to go on a reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s2744">So I asked them, what are you -- and he said, oh, our leader is coming back soon.</span> <span id="s2745">Fine.</span> <span id="s2746">So I divide my men in three groups.</span> <span id="s2747">I took four or five men with me, and the civilians, the five.</span> <span id="s2748">I sent five the other way, and the other ones remained with the Communists with the machine gun there.</span> <span id="s2749">The Germans were having lunch, they got lunch break, in a farm just south of the village.</span> <span id="s2750">We came out from two sides.</span> <span id="s2751">And we didn’t know how many there were.</span> <span id="s2752">We were told by civilians that seen them before there were about 150 in the trucks, 20 trucks lined up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: They had 20 trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: They were lined up -- there was a farm and the access road through the main highway.</span> <span id="s2755">The other side of the farm was land, so they couldn’t even go through there, and I came from that side.</span> <span id="s2756">So [indecipherable] somebody fires at the Germans, and they are aware that something is going on here, and then the one -- one of my civilians to whom I had given a pistol, had three b-bullets in the pistol, he aims at a German, closes his eyes and fires.</span> <span id="s2757">I said, my God, you didn’t do any -- y-y-you think you’re going to aim at anybody that way?</span> <span id="s2758">I was furious because he give our position away too soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: So the Germans were alert now that there are new -- two groups at least, around here.</span> <span id="s2761">So they decided they were forced to go south anyway, so they pulled out.</span> <span id="s2762">As they were on the highway, I have come around and I counted trucks, that’s how I knew -- I -- I wouldn’t say 20, it may be 19 plus one or minus one.</span> <span id="s2763">It was about that number.</span> <span id="s2764">So they go on and we shoot into the trucks.</span> <span id="s2765">Whether we hit anybody or not we didn’t know, because they had the covers o-on the trucks there.</span> <span id="s2766">But they go on fine.</span> <span id="s2767">Then, a short while later -- by the way, the ci -- the Communists were in ci -- in -- in civilian clothes, so they could disappear in case things got too hot, so the Germans wouldn’t know them from civilians.</span> <span id="s2768">The problem was though, if the Germans couldn’t tell who shot at them, they would take civilian hostages no matter where, and kill them, innocent people.</span> <span id="s2769">Anyway, it was [indecipherable] truck came back [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2770">We -- the two groups had joined them over here that point.</span> <span id="s2771">And the truck stops with the white flag, and the -- one of my men gets up and the -- the Germans shoot him in the leg.</span> <span id="s2772">Th-The -- the time [indecipherable] timing is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2773">And we were in the vineyards, it was about that high.</span> <span id="s2774">We could not raise our heads because we’d be dead.</span> <span id="s2775">So I decide to crawl in the -- in the vines between the vineyard, and go to a farm, which is on the -- one of the pictures I show you.</span> <span id="s2776">And I go behind, they have a stairway going up into the attic.</span> <span id="s2777">I go up there, the door is locked, I take my rifle and try to shoot the door and lock off.</span> <span id="s2778">The farmer runs up from nowheres, he says, “Attendez, j’ai la clé.”</span> <span id="s2779">Wait, I have the key.</span> <span id="s2780">I says, fine, open up.</span> <span id="s2781">And I told him to -- I order him, I didn’t ask him -- ask him, I told him, remove one tile edge end of the roof so I can see the road, and use the opening for shooting at the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: Wait a minute, excuse me.</span> <span id="s2783">Is there something -- there a problem?</span> <span id="s2784">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s2785">All right, so you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: So I’m through to the openings that were [indecipherable] the Germans and my -- one guy had been wounded already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">A: And the three maga -- the three Communists are still walking towards the west lake, and I had to stop shooting because of the bunch of th -- they were in the -- in the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: Because you could have hit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: Could have killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">A: So I go back down and we are taking my buddy, put in a -- well, we -- a ligature, we took a belt and tied that on.</span> <span id="s2793">He -- he had been hit in the femoral artery, he was bleeding very badly.</span> <span id="s2794">Wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: So you tried to stop the bleeding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: I-I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: You tried to stop the bleeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2801">So one of the guys says -- had his -- taken his belt off and did that, but we had not even a Band-Aid, no bandages whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2802">So then the four of us, we picked up a ladder from the farmer, it was laid on, and we took my buddy on it, and we had to carry him very low because the vineyard’s very low to start with, and we could not afford to raise any dust by dragging him on the soil.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">A: So that was a -- some mess there.</span> <span id="s2805">Anyway, we got him to the village again.</span> <span id="s2806">Meantime Bank had been alerted, and he was there with the Commandant -- well, th-the leader of the whole district.</span> <span id="s2807">And so I -- I made my report of everything was -- was happening, and the meantime I find out that the Germans has gone back, they fled.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: And what happened to the Communists who went up to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Oh they were -- they were taking prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: They were take --</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: The Germans took them with them.</span> <span id="s2812">We found them later on tied to trees with the eyes punched out and the ears cut off.</span> <span id="s2813">They didn’t die.</span> <span id="s2814">Didn’t kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: They didn’t kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: They just let them suffer, and they died anyway, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s2818">So that was your first experience.</span> <span id="s2819">Did it make you want to not do it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">A: Well, [indecipherable] says, anybody who is stupid enough to do what you did should be an officer.</span> <span id="s2821">So he promoted me and gave me a Croix de Guerre Silver Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2823">Were you frightened?</span> <span id="s2824">At the end, I mean, did it -- did you think, oh my God, what’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: Well, I don’t know why, I felt that I was responsible for the -- for my guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">A: So I had enough strength there to see to it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: -- that we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q: Now is Max with you also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: Yes, he was in -- on one group there, yes.</span> <span id="s2832">The -- the group that was on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">Q: And what did he think of the fact that you took this over?</span> <span id="s2834">Was he shocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: He was with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: He was with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: You know you -- there’s a French saying, “La valeur n’attends pas les nombres des années.”</span> <span id="s2838">Valor does not wait for the number of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: So you can be young and done --</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">Q: Or you can be old and done, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Now, would there -- were there other skirmishes, were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: Yes, the na -- the next day, we were -- the s -- forgot the name -- the monter des silhols, s-i-l-h-o-l-s, la monter is m-o-n-t-e-r, des, d-e-s, silhols, that’s a rise in the road.</span> <span id="s2845">And we -- I should say, what happened that night, I was put on duty over there, we had moved position, we had walked a few kilometers, one after the o -- behind each other, to get new position, and then I was mid -- charged in middle of the night, on guard duty.</span> <span id="s2846">At about six o’clock in the morning, my captain comes along -- not so higher -- n-nothing than the captain.</span> <span id="s2847">And he says I will have an arms inspection.</span> <span id="s2848">Okay.</span> <span id="s2849">All of a sudden I realized that my bolt had been removed from my rifle.</span> <span id="s2850">He had been there during the night and saw me asleep and then he’d removed it.</span> <span id="s2851">He says, if it happens again, anybody who is falling asleep on guard duty is going to be shot.</span> <span id="s2852">I got the message.</span> <span id="s2853">So anyway, in the afternoon, I -- he gives me permission to go to Alès, which is a few kilometers down, for the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2854">I went to a friend of -- one of the maquisards, who lend me his bicycle, from his father.</span> <span id="s2855">So I go to Alès, and guess what, they tell me the Germans are fighting over there in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2856">So I go back on the bicycle, I had only 100 in my [indecipherable] there and what happened, the tru -- German truck had a trailer with gasoline behind it.</span> <span id="s2857">It came from the airport of Nimes.</span> <span id="s2858">And there were about 13 Germans in the truck, in the trailer, and -- it was a truck, this was a big truck.</span> <span id="s2859">Three in the front, one on the side with this machine gun, and the rest was inside the truck.</span> <span id="s2860">So they hit the -- our machine gunner who was on duty at the [indecipherable] over there, and he hit the German who was on the side of the car, and hit him right in the chest, and he was badly hit there.</span> <span id="s2861">And then he killed the three in the front seat.</span> <span id="s2862">And by that time I had arrived.</span> <span id="s2863">They had some that jumped off the truck, Germans, some had escaped.</span> <span id="s2864">And some were afraid because they did not know which way to move.</span> <span id="s2865">So then I looked, and there was a [indecipherable] I don’t know, it’s a ditch --</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">A: -- and there was a pistol in there.</span> <span id="s2868">I grabbed the pistol, it’s a German pistol, I put my rifle on my shoulder.</span> <span id="s2869">And then I go on the side of the truck, and all of a sudden two Germans jump out.</span> <span id="s2870">And I was right behind them, so I said, [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s2871">Hands up.</span> <span id="s2872">They do that immediately, and I [indecipherable] and I bring back to rest of the group.</span> <span id="s2873">This was so stupid on ma -- on my part, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s2874">I did not realize that there was no charger in the pa -- gun, that the gun was empty, and this pistol has a small lever that goes up if there is a bullet in the to -- in -- in the chamber, and the lever goes up and -- and the German says geladen, loaded.</span> <span id="s2875">And it was down.</span> <span id="s2876">So if the Germans had faced me, I would have been dead.</span> <span id="s2877">They would have realized there was no bullet there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: And I would have been gone.</span> <span id="s2880">You know, how -- how often can you be lucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">Q: But did -- did you know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: You didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: I didn’t know about it, I found out afterwards that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: -- yeah, I found out the thing was empty.</span> <span id="s2887">I didn’t know about the lever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: So it was good you never --</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: The lever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">Q: -- you never asked these guys to turn around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">A: I know, I -- I -- I was -- they turned sideways, and then I told them to line up, and let them talk to each other for awhile to see if they were communicating anything that was important, because I wanted to find out how many had escaped.</span> <span id="s2892">So this point then told them [indecipherable] you know?</span> <span id="s2893">They realize I spoke German also, and they -- they stopped talking.</span> <span id="s2894">Then we took them in to a -- no, there was one more guy that had escaped and was captured, and th -- they had dropped the machine -- the guy that was on the side of that, you know, truck had a machine gun, but somehow or other that pulled off the -- what they were -- the mechanism is to fire.</span> <span id="s2895">So my captain told me, ask him where the piece is, and tell that you’re going to kill him if he doesn’t tell you, or how it functions, so forth.</span> <span id="s2896">So I told him in German, and I tried to be a serious as possible and hey, you know, threatening.</span> <span id="s2897">And he says, I’m sorry, I -- I was a fireman at the base in ni -- Nimes, I was not in the infantry.</span> <span id="s2898">[indecipherable] know that’s a lie, because everybody gets trained for weapons.</span> <span id="s2899">But anyway, we couldn’t find the -- the missing piece, and then we took him to Alès with the truck that was damaged, the se -- the windshield was shot out.</span> <span id="s2900">We took the wounded German with us, we brought them to lycée, a school in Alès that served a -- as a hospital, and I think he couldn’t make it though, because he had been really badly shot right in the chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">A: And the German prisoner, I took him then to the city hall, where they had an officer that was interrogating prisoners.</span> <span id="s2903">So we passed a truck that had been brought there already, and he asked me to go to find his -- I don’t recall that there -- it’s -- it’s a gamere, it’s where you eat, you know, it’s like a metal dish or some [indecipherable] that you can fold, and so -- and said what is that, because that were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: Is it a mess kit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">A: -- mess kit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q: Is it a mess kit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A: And then that word I didn’t understand, it was a -- I’m not [indecipherable] and then he explained that to me, and I -- and I said, okay.</span> <span id="s2908">Look, I’ll let you go up in the truck and find it, but I’m going to shoot you if you have anything else.</span> <span id="s2909">And he went up -- up -- klamotte, that was the name, k-l-a-m-o-t-t-e, klamotte.</span> <span id="s2910">I had to translate -- I have to spell German, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">A: Anyway, he come back out and I turn him in to the -- interrogating officer, which was a G2 mit -- milit -- military intelligence, and they took over from there.</span> <span id="s2913">They put all the prisoners in a -- in jail, actually, cause they had no other place for them, except in the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: So that was then th -- oh no, before that, we knew some had escaped in the -- in the fields, so I took him along and some of my guys and the friends there came along.</span> <span id="s2916">We went to a farm, and the farmer offered us anisette.</span> <span id="s2917">It’s a French drink, it’s a very strong, good thing, and I feel sorry for the guy.</span> <span id="s2918">Are you thirsty?</span> <span id="s2919">Is he thirsty?</span> <span id="s2920">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2921">So I says, okay, give him bottle.</span> <span id="s2922">[indecipherable] anisette.</span> <span id="s2923">He was so happy, he was -- it was August, it was very hot, too.</span> <span id="s2924">And I took him to town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2926">Now the end of August, something really terrible happened when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2928">There was one more incident in between --</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">A: -- but I was not involved that one because I was not selected to that team.</span> <span id="s2931">But that was a party, a very small thing, there was no -- nobody killed.</span> <span id="s2932">[indecipherable] like that.</span> <span id="s2933">Germans [indecipherable] escaped then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: And on the 27th of August, early in the morning, it’s a Sunday, our captain gives the order to take his troops to a certain crossroad to prevent the Germans from coming back towards Alès.</span> <span id="s2936">And he’s told it’s a very strong column.</span> <span id="s2937">Civilians had been informed by a German medic who had been well [indecipherable] by them [indecipherable] that they should get away from their homes because a big column come by and they are fierce guys, they are Russians -- they were Tatars, Mongols, about 2000 of them, Russians, and a thousand Germans or so.</span> <span id="s2938">So somehow she got the message through to the resistance that we should be careful, the troop will be coming by.</span> <span id="s2939">So my captain was ordered to intercept them.</span> <span id="s2940">We got there, it’s too bad -- I had the pistol, the -- the mats we were in, the hills.</span> <span id="s2941">And he located us on a certain perim-perimeter.</span> <span id="s2942">There were three hills there, and then the horde was going right between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">A: So he was a good tactician.</span> <span id="s2945">He was a captain in the artillery, in reserve, and he found us excellent positions there.</span> <span id="s2946">There were two machine guns that were in a rocky area, and they had the -- a domineery -- domineering positions and we -- our group, the commander, the 20, were set up at front, right as the road turns and the Germans came from that direction.</span> <span id="s2947">So we were hard in position, it was hot as can be.</span> <span id="s2948">And thirsty, you know, nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s2949">Anyway, we hear horses galloping around there, and then we see motorcycles coming, and there’s a patrol, German, reconnoitering the area.</span> <span id="s2950">And one fellow on the machine gun fired too soon.</span> <span id="s2951">The Germans were not supposed to be attacked until they were in certain position where we had a -- a larger group under fire.</span> <span id="s2952">And I guess he may have t -- hit some motorcyclists there, and then the Germans spread all over the place.</span> <span id="s2953">We fought them for about seven hours.</span> <span id="s2954">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2955">I mean, we were in good positions, we were on the hills, they were in the plain, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">Q: Fred?</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">A: -- my [indecipherable] wounded -- I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: I’m going to stop you now, because I don’t -- I don’t want to stop you in the middle of the story, so let’s stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">A: No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2967">I’m sorry for the interruption.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">A: No, no, no, no, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">Q: So you were in battle for seven hours --</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: -- and you were in the stronger position, and nevertheless you still weren’t able to stop them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: Well, they couldn’t advance, actually.</span> <span id="s2973">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: Yeah, they couldn’t -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">A: But then they came around on the right flank, they went around the hill, and we found out about that, so we -- the [indecipherable] and we -- a machine gun that was moved over to stop them, too.</span> <span id="s2976">We found out certain things afterwards.</span> <span id="s2977">For instance the commander asked -- he was a major, asked civilians if the resistance had been in the village.</span> <span id="s2978">And he says, yes, they came by for some water, but we didn’t know who they are, we did not cooperate with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: That’s fine.</span> <span id="s2981">And then he asked how many were they.</span> <span id="s2982">So this young kid apparently told them, oh, probably a th -- a thousand or so, exaggerating.</span> <span id="s2983">But the major laughed and told him yeah, probably a hundred, 200, which is actually quite -- we were 120 [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2984">Anyway, they took a hostage in the village, a poor guy that had come back from work and had gone to see his parents.</span> <span id="s2985">And they thought he was a terrorist also, and they tied him up, I fo -- found out later on, on the back of a horse drawn carriage, and dragged him to his death.</span> <span id="s2986">He was dead.</span> <span id="s2987">There was one captain that was apparently a -- a -- a [indecipherable] one, and he’s the one that got all of this.</span> <span id="s2988">There was one lieutenant apparently, in the German outfit that when they tried to shoot some -- one of the civilians that were there, called Commandant, Commandant.</span> <span id="s2989">Our Commandant was over there, he asked what was going on, so he said, don’t shoot the civilians.</span> <span id="s2990">So you know, this is -- we found out afterwards.</span> <span id="s2991">Anyway, we had to have more help.</span> <span id="s2992">So our captain sent a motorcycle -- m-motorcycle -- motorcyclist to the headquarter of Bank and said we need some support.</span> <span id="s2993">And Bank immediately called up by radio -- there was a carrier -- aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, and he asked for a-assistance.</span> <span id="s2994">And they said they will send two planes.</span> <span id="s2995">And th-the message came back to us, they will be there in half an hour, and it took about an hour, but anyway the two planes came in, machine gunned the Germans.</span> <span id="s2996">They came in very low, just [indecipherable] circled, and they machine-gunned them.</span> <span id="s2997">And that slowed the Germans down, and we had time to pull back, because we had to -- we could not hold the positions any more.</span> <span id="s2998">At that time the Germans -- when the planes left -- we were stupid, too.</span> <span id="s2999">When the planes were over, we got very excited and we took out hankies and we waved at them, you know?</span> <span id="s3000">That was a bad move because Germans saw where we were, our positions.</span> <span id="s3001">As soon as the planes left we got hit by artillery you wouldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s3002">I mean, it came down raining like anything.</span> <span id="s3003">And apparently my brother was killed there, but I did not know that at the time.</span> <span id="s3004">The captain ordered us to pull back, and on the way down the lieutenant said, “Fred, we need you down by the car.”</span> <span id="s3005">There -- there was a -- a [indecipherable] parked [indecipherable] and when we got on there he says, “Max is dead.”</span> <span id="s3006">I said, “What?</span> <span id="s3007">What happened?”</span> <span id="s3008">We -- we were close by, but there was a hill and he was on one side, at a [indecipherable], and I didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s3009">The bi -- shells -- the shells were falling all over the place.</span> <span id="s3010">And he says yes -- and he say -- and I -- when I moved to go back, he -- he -- he stopped me.</span> <span id="s3011">And he put me in the car and drove me home -- to the next village.</span> <span id="s3012">Next morning we go back, there was one of our men had been left behind.</span> <span id="s3013">He apparently could not follow us, and he had 29 Russian prisoners with him.</span> <span id="s3014">And how do you do that?</span> <span id="s3015">He says, well, I saw them over there, and they were trying to hide, and there I was, so I point to them [indecipherable] and they surrendered.</span> <span id="s3016">So we got close to them -- because they wanted to surrender, they didn’t want to fight with the Germans any more.</span> <span id="s3017">So when we got close, then lined up and my lieutenant -- there’s a difference between lieutenant and the captain, they always interchange you know, whoever was in charge at the time.</span> <span id="s3018">So my lieutenant tries to speak to them, he doesn’t speak Russian, and I don’t speak Russian either.</span> <span id="s3019">And then this Russian soldier goes, heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s3020">And I take my rifle [indecipherable] and kill him.</span> <span id="s3021">So my lieutenant puts my rifle down, and the Russian’s leader tells him, no, this is -- salute this way, not this way.</span> <span id="s3022">He was lucky, he nearly got killed over there.</span> <span id="s3023">But I understand, I mean, he did not know, you know, there was -- there were -- leaders, many of them didn’t know what the heil Hitler meant to a -- to the French.</span> <span id="s3024">And then we went -- during the night, more had surrendered, and we had captured a total of about 300 [indecipherable] citation from the German, 300 prisoners.</span> <span id="s3025">And some surrendered in the morning, some had gone to the next village and surrendered over there.</span> <span id="s3026">So we captured all of them.</span> <span id="s3027">Couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s3028">N-Not many Germans, all Russians, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">Q: Not many Germans in that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">A: They were -- no.</span> <span id="s3031">They were pretty fanatics.</span> <span id="s3032">They wouldn't surrender, those guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">Q: When was your brother buried?</span> <span id="s3034">Soon after?</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3036">So the same afternoon, they brought -- put him on a truck and they told me to go on, and they had an honor guard in the truck, too.</span> <span id="s3037">Went back up to the village, in Saint -- St-Etienne valais Française, which is the city before St-Germain-de-Calbert, they had already no-notified the people that we are coming.</span> <span id="s3038">The honor guard were there.</span> <span id="s3039">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3040">Then I got home and my father co-comes down the street there.</span> <span id="s3041">He said, “Oh, that’s my son, shot.”</span> <span id="s3042">We brang him in, my mom and my sister are there.</span> <span id="s3043">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">Q: So you were the one who told them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">Q: You were the one who told them that -- that Max was dead, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">A: No, because the -- they had oper -- the news -- they fied -- the telephone operator at the post office.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">A: And they had notified my parents we were coming in.</span> <span id="s3050">Then we s-stayed at the house the o-overnight, and then the lady whose son had passed away the week before said that we should bury him next to her son.</span> <span id="s3051">And they put him in a double coffin, because we told them that we are going to move him from there.</span> <span id="s3052">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">Q: It must have been awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3055">And then the eulogy from the pastor -- the protestant minister [indecipherable] translation?</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3058">There’s about 800 people showing up his funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">Q: 800.</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">A: Almost the whole village.</span> <span id="s3061">And o-other villages, too, you know.</span> <span id="s3062">Well, after that I stayed a few days in the village, then I was sent back to my unit, and at -- was transferred to -- my parents went back to Montpellier, because this was all free at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">Q: At that point -- it was a kind of liberation at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3065">Y --</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">Q: In August of ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3068">You know, Bank -- not Bank, the Polish captain that had the Polish troops there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">A: Well, he was part of the liberators from Montpellier.</span> <span id="s3071">So things had settled down.</span> <span id="s3072">The same thing is with the resistance.</span> <span id="s3073">They had organized, but they were not in office yet, but they have pre -- they had made preparations to take over as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s3074">So it didn’t take much time to get in -- take over the -- the officer there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3075">Q: So you have very little mourning period for your brother.</span> <span id="s3076">I mean, you’re home for a couple of days and then you have to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A: I had to go back, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">Q: Was that be -- was that better for you, that you could go back and work?</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">A: I wanted to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">Q: You wanted to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">A: I want the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">A: My parents did not object to me going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">Q: They didn’t want you to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">A: They did not object.</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">Q: They didn’t object.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">A: They knew why I wanted to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">Q: Do you think they were afraid that something would happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: If they were they wouldn’t let me know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: They didn’t say</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: And maybe they were also more or less -- they saw down that they had the anxiety, you know, they will not see things.</span> <span id="s3092">Then, I went back to -- with the major, to whom I wrote about -- the lieutenant had lied, you know, about my combat.</span> <span id="s3093">And he took me back to our unit.</span> <span id="s3094">And then later on I was -- my parents were in Montpellier, I was transferred there, and I was transferred to the headquarter of the division as the interpreter for de Chambrun, who [indecipherable] and they gave me my rank, and my -- my rank at that time [indecipherable] it was on the 14th of July.</span> <span id="s3095">And then I was in G2, Deuxième Bureau.</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">Q: And is that because your brother was killed so that you could not be in the armed resistance any more, or was this because there was liberation at that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">A: Well, the Germans [indecipherable] by that time, there was nothing to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">Q: There was nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3100">Then they took the other guys that were in my outfit and they put them in the regular army, those who volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">A: And then they got the French uniforms on the [indecipherable] so the one will have all [indecipherable] on --</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">A: -- as well as afterwards.</span> <span id="s3105">They were organized at the 81st regiment.</span> <span id="s3106">It was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3107">There is a rule in the French army, if you are sole surviving son, you don’t go back in combat, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3108">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">A: Because they want the family tree to continue.</span> <span id="s3110">As long as you are in combat, and one has been killed in combat --</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">A: -- then the other one doesn’t go back in.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">A: But that was not reason there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">A: They trust me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">Q: So it was different for you.</span> <span id="s3118">So now you are in the intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">A: G2.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: And the first thing that happens, they had me first day, German manuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: German manuals?</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: Yes, they had the weapon man -- manuals about the certain glass jars [indecipherable] it was, there was a manual with it, I found out that these were firebombs.</span> <span id="s3124">You break them and everything, it goes up in fire, you know.</span> <span id="s3125">And machine guns were different [indecipherable] became busy and then later on my -- the Commandant de Chambrun, was replaced because he wasn’t wer -- found to be untrustworthy because I think somehow or other he had the affiliation with the Communists.</span> <span id="s3126">And that goes way back, and he was [indecipherable] let him completely from the res -- from the army.</span> <span id="s3127">In comes General -- Colonel Zeller, at the time, and he puts together all the officers of his headquarter, shakes their hands, looks at me.</span> <span id="s3128">And next thing I know, he gives me first rate, a -- a book in German.</span> <span id="s3129">He spoke German perfectly, but he did not want to let on.</span> <span id="s3130">And what does he give me?</span> <span id="s3131">A book on a house of ill repute that the Germans have recorded the names of the girl [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3132">He says, what is this about?</span> <span id="s3133">He just wanted to pull my leg, you know?</span> <span id="s3134">What a character.</span> <span id="s3135">But he --</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">Q: So did you translate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">A: -- I just said that -- that’s what it is, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">Q: That’s what it is, that’s the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3142">He knew that.</span> <span id="s3143">But I knew what he was up to, just to try to give me a hard time because I -- a young guy.</span> <span id="s3144">And then I was very much involved with interrogating prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s3145">There was one that -- a few of them volunteered information so they could [indecipherable] before.</span> <span id="s3146">And one was -- said that he had a gir -- a ger -- a French girlfriend, and she was expecting.</span> <span id="s3147">And she got in touch with her office, she would like to have [indecipherable] father.</span> <span id="s3148">And he said that he was an Alsatian, not a German, so they sent me out to investigate.</span> <span id="s3149">And sure enough, he says, well, my father was working in Alsace-Lorraine at one time, as a waiter.</span> <span id="s3150">I says to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">Q: A waiter?</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">A: Waiter in a hotel -- in a restaurant, yeah.</span> <span id="s3153">I says, and are you Alsatian?</span> <span id="s3154">H says, no, my father was working there.</span> <span id="s3155">Okay.</span> <span id="s3156">I wrote back a [indecipherable] report, and I se -- send them to the -- they moved o -- the mines in the -- on the beaches.</span> <span id="s3157">I was so furious that they tried to take advantage, I say, you know, these French [indecipherable] but I told them --</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">Q: Where’d they put him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">A: I tol -- I told them to send him to the mine field.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">Q: To the mine fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">A: Yeah, because the Germans were set to remove the mines on the beaches there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">A: In southern France, and because he had done that, I figured he should be punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">A: I -- I was a bad guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: You were -- you were a -- you were a mean guy, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3168">And then the other one --</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">Q: The-They did what you asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s3173">The -- you know, the -- he speaks German, th -- my officers, I accepted the job [indecipherable] involved in this case.</span> <span id="s3174">And then there was a case where I mentioned before, this one was employed by [indecipherable] and he was to -- he has impor-important information for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">A: So I drove past Nimes to the farm, and then he told me that the -- this was much later, though, when Germany had surrendered in -- in May, I believe, ’45.</span> <span id="s3177">And he told me that the 19 German army who had come from that i -- from our area, had broke up some dirt in a school yard, and buried all the radio equipment in there, which is valuable stuff to have, you know.</span> <span id="s3178">And had dumped all the electrical wiring over the side of a cliff.</span> <span id="s3179">So I made a report to G2 and they sent it to general -- General [indecipherable] group -- well he is -- he was the [indecipherable] marshal later on, but he sent his G2 officer there, and they checked into it.</span> <span id="s3180">I haven’t heard from him since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3182">Were you also in charge of military mapping?</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">Q: What was that -- what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s3186">Each headquarter has a mapping department.</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">A: It’s a -- a -- a division has the maps for combat if they have to go so and so [indecipherable] such a place, they have to have maps of all the areas, copies of them at least.</span> <span id="s3189">They can always make copies later on, they have a special p-process.</span> <span id="s3190">So they figured hey, you can do that.</span> <span id="s3191">Well, what happened first, he says, they had a map of the combats in Russia, and they had this lieutenant who kept it up to date.</span> <span id="s3192">They had the string with a [indecipherable] attached on the bottom, and they had pins there, and they had the string going with pins and show the progress from one day to the next.</span> <span id="s3193">So he got a different assignment so they put me in there, because they had the BBC every day, they were listening on the radio, and [indecipherable] information as to the progress m-made by the Russians on -- on their front.</span> <span id="s3194">[indecipherable] in Europe, but also I guess they didn’t trust the Russians either at that time.</span> <span id="s3195">Anyway, so they put me there, and then [indecipherable] that’s not enough work for you, so they give me the mapping department.</span> <span id="s3196">So I -- I found out that fish market in Montpellier was selling fish and wrapping them in that excellent paper which is used for maps.</span> <span id="s3197">So I sent somebody to investigate and he said they have a whole bunch maps in a certain place in Alès.</span> <span id="s3198">So I found out about that.</span> <span id="s3199">I took two German POW’s, and one guard to go with me, and the chauffeur.</span> <span id="s3200">And we went over there and took back about 20,000 maps.</span> <span id="s3201">That was a gold trove.</span> <span id="s3202">Those maps are expensive to -- to make.</span> <span id="s3203">And they -- some were overwritten in German, but they were actually French, French maps that they had captured before.</span> <span id="s3204">So the general was very pleased, and he had me make some shelves for all of those, it was quite a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">Q: 20,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">A: 20,000 maps.</span> <span id="s3207">You know, it was [indecipherable] to the French army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">A: Because they’re the ones [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: Maps, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: When -- when your parents go back to Montpellier --</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">Q: Do you then go back with them and live with them and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: -- and still work in the armed -- and -- and are you based in Montpellier now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: You are.</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: The headquarter division is in Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">Q: In Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">A: Then my father meet some people there, and he said, you know, we have a lot of people coming back from the camps.</span> <span id="s3224">We got to do something for them.</span> <span id="s3225">And he got in touch with Jewish organizations, I guess in Paris [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3226">And they were assigned the responsibility for helping those people.</span> <span id="s3227">And they had about eight or 10 different organizations in that federation.</span> <span id="s3228">My father was director of the one federation, and five locations in the States, in those days were on there [indecipherable] the cities.</span> <span id="s3229">So they obtained money to give out to the refugees, a -- a monthly sum.</span> <span id="s3230">My father says, no, that is not what you should do.</span> <span id="s3231">We don’t have to give charity to those people, they need something more substantial so they can get back on their feet, like human beings.</span> <span id="s3232">Those were profession -- excuse me -- we should try to get them the equipment that they need to go back in their professions.</span> <span id="s3233">I remember of two specific instances, I guess.</span> <span id="s3234">One was the shoemaker who needed shoe -- the equipment to repair shoes, and they were able to se -- he said okay, we should try to give them a lump sum, equivalent to maybe one or three years of a charity.</span> <span id="s3235">If they have the money later on, they can repay it and if not -- either they can give more to other people, but if not, there you go.</span> <span id="s3236">And they agreed to that.</span> <span id="s3237">So he was able to get enough money for the people to buy equipment that they had needed, and that was an excellent idea, because the people had self respect again.</span> <span id="s3238">They came from the camps and had lost all the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">Q: Now, was this money given to men, or to both men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">A: Whoever applied.</span> <span id="s3241">The women got the money to live on, but the -- there was actually to go back in business, if they had some business of sorts, yes.</span> <span id="s3242">But otherwise they -- they didn’t have to get that much money, but if they were a family, so that helped, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3244">Now, there’s this period --</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">A: Very few -- I am sorry -- very few women come back from that -- from there to Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">Q: More men came back.</span> <span id="s3247">Many more men.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">A: Not ma -- not many.</span> <span id="s3249">Not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">Q: Not many men either.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: Compared to the women there were more men, but not that many, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: But not that many anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">A: There were few hundreds probably, at the time.</span> <span id="s3254">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">Q: The period that you’re in the resistance --</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">Q: -- there’s a kind of silence about what your father is doing.</span> <span id="s3258">Did -- do you not know what he’s doing during that period of time, because the war is over, and then he starts up immediately to -- to -- to do something, do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s3259">There’s this period of great activity of your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">A: Oh yes, I know [indecipherable] because they had the different groups.</span> <span id="s3261">One helped the people from the camps, and then that o-organization to provide them food, and the other organizations to try to find family members, housing and so forth.</span> <span id="s3262">And then I was called in once by one of the attorneys, yeah, to go with him.</span> <span id="s3263">One -- or big department store had been taken over by Jewish organization -- the -- the Vichy organization for confiscating Jewish property.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">A: So he says, look, we have to reclaim this property.</span> <span id="s3266">The people there had been -- had disappeared, we don’t know where they are, but we want to get this back into our control in case the people come back.</span> <span id="s3267">So some local women had bought the property of -- at a auction.</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: So I said fine.</span> <span id="s3270">He told them they should be at h -- at the office -- at the -- at the store at one o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s3271">I took one soldier with me -- I was an officer at that time, and he went with me.</span> <span id="s3272">We got there and I -- he says, turn over your keys.</span> <span id="s3273">They turned over the keys, good-bye, and he assumed responsibility for his clients.</span> <span id="s3274">I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">A: You know [indecipherable] can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">A: But that was a -- an activity at least it was justified, take property back first and worry about restitution --</span></p> <p><span id="s3279">Q: So how soon after the war do you -- or after your liberation, do you discover what had gone on in eastern Europe, and the murder of the Jews?</span> <span id="s3280">Do you -- was it months, was it later than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">A: Probably three months, because when they rescued people in the camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s3282">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3283">A: -- they came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3284">Q: And then they told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3286">Newspapers, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3287">Q: So this must have been a huge shock to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3288">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s3289">We did not know the extent.</span> <span id="s3290">We knew some camps, because the first one was like maybe Mauthausen in Austria, where some of the first was liberated by the western powers.</span> <span id="s3291">Russians liberated Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">A: So, you know, a different time frame.</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">Q: It’s -- right.</span> <span id="s3295">Did that -- was that extremely depressing to you?</span> <span id="s3296">I mean, what were --</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">A: Yeah, very shocking, infinitely so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3298">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">A: I couldn’t dream that people could do that to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">Q: Now your parents lose close relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s3302">My father lost that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">Q: So that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">A: -- he had his mother and had at least five -- four -- four brothers and a sister, plus their families.</span> <span id="s3305">They were all married and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">Q: So in some ways, as difficult as your life was during this time, you’re in a -- a kind of bubble.</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">Q: Of not really knowing what else is happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s3310">And then we found out, when Jackie, the young boy came back out of Flossenberg, and the colonel left him with us, then we found a lot more of what happened over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">Q: So tell that story a little bit, this is a -- a -- somebody --</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">A: Okay, there was American troops in -- went in Germany, they liberated the camp of Flossenberg, F-l-o-s-s-e-n-b-e-r-g, and they find this little boy, he’s about 14 - 15 years old, and this American Major Leland, he was American officer, decides that he has no parents any more, well the boy told him he had no more parents, and he wants to adopt him, eventually.</span> <span id="s3313">So he goes with him -- takes him with him in the unit for awhile.</span> <span id="s3314">He gets an americ -- an American uniform, you know [indecipherable] troops, and then when he was transferred out to Avignon.</span> <span id="s3315">There was a big [indecipherable] Aix [indecipherable] Aix - Aix -- Aix-en-Provence.</span> <span id="s3316">And the troops are there, the major has a brother over there who’s also a doctor and they come to visit Montpellier.</span> <span id="s3317">And somehow or other they come to a Jewish committee of the organizations and they meet my father, and they mention about the little boy -- the boy comes with him too.</span> <span id="s3318">After awhile the major is supposed to go to the Pacific, and he has met my father, so he asks him what -- will you take care of the boy?</span> <span id="s3319">He was more welcome because my parents were still missing my brother and now he would fill in --</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">A: -- a -- a void.</span> <span id="s3322">So said, sure.</span> <span id="s3323">And he asked when Leland send a letter to [indecipherable] you before, asking him to help out.</span> <span id="s3324">Then a -- a few weeks later he makes -- he asked my father make arrangements with the American consulate in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s3325">So when the papers are ready, the tickets are ready for shipping and all that, my sister and my father are in Marseilles, see the consul there, and everything is finished and Jackie is with them over there, so the amba -- the amb -- the consul asked my sister, “Don’t you want to go to America, too?”</span> <span id="s3326">She says, “Yes, but we can’t.”</span> <span id="s3327">Why not?</span> <span id="s3328">“It will take years for us to get papers.”</span> <span id="s3329">He says, “Send me your papers.”</span> <span id="s3330">It was the beginning of -- it’s the end of May.</span> <span id="s3331">I [indecipherable] the beginning of March ’46.</span> <span id="s3332">We send the papers in and within a month time we have papers to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s3333">Now, this was tricky, because you had to have the ships cards, too.</span> <span id="s3334">Now it’s just a Peter or Paul, which comes first.</span> <span id="s3335">They would not give us actually the visa.</span> <span id="s3336">Yes, you ha -- they’re coming to you, but you must show us the visa -- the -- the ship cards, and vice versa.</span> <span id="s3337">Anyway, I found out that the French government had some places available on a boat repatriating French citizens back to United States who had come back to France to fight.</span> <span id="s3338">So they were -- had priorities to go back to -- see.</span> <span id="s3339">And that included also people in the resistance.</span> <span id="s3340">When I found out that, I said okay, let’s get the ship cards.</span> <span id="s3341">We got those, and then we went back and we got the visa, in about one month’s time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">A: It was extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">Q: We need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">Q: Fred, did you want to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">Q: Did you want to go to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">A: We had no family after awhile, except the one cousin of my father in Paris.</span> <span id="s3353">The family had been wiped out or had come already, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3354">Q: So you had some family here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">Q: But what did you think of the -- excuse me -- what did you think of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s3357">A: It’s a great country to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s3358">Q: It -- but you didn’t know that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">Q: But did you think

<p><span id="s3388">Q: Right, that’s right, it’s quite nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">A: On Amsterdam Avenue, I think, was there a bakery or -- not quite a bakery, a Swiss cake shop where they sold cakes and pastry and whatnot?</span> <span id="s3390">Or wouldn’t you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">Q: I lived, you know, much later --</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">A: I was young

Virginia?</span></p> <p><span id="s3401">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3402">Q: In Virginia?</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">A: Yeah, I’m quite sure it was, because we had two storms in the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s3404">We had a small boat, a -- a liberty ship, 10,000 ton, which was [indecipherable] more than the sea.</span> <span id="s3405">Newport -- no.</span> <span id="s3406">Oh God, Norfolk?</span> <span id="s3407">No, it was Norfolk, Virginia, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">Q: Norfolk?</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3410">And then we -- somebody called the news organization over there to receive us, and then get us to the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3412">A: So they sent a lady over there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3413">Q: And then you went to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">Q: Now, does Jack go with you the whole

id="s3422">Q: So that must have been disappointing to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">A: I suppose.</span> <span id="s3424">What happened is, my father raised the roof when he -- when we came over here, he went to the Jewish organizations in -- in New York, and Jackie was being taken care of by somebody over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3425">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">A: And he asked them, do you give him any money -- pocket money, anything to go to the movies or stuff like that?</span> <span id="s3427">No, no.</span> <span id="s3428">He raised the roof, he says, this child has the right to li -- live like a child.</span> <span id="s3429">You have a nerve not to -- you know, to treat him as one.</span> <span id="s3430">And he -- he was really mad.</span> <span id="s3431">He helped him out.</span> <span id="s3432">They put -- put him up with somebody and he wa -- got very friendly with the people to the point that he changed his name to their name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">Q: So they had -- did they adopt him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3434">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: They didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: No.</span> <span id="s3437">I guess they had children of their own already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">Q: So he never had a f -- a family growing up when he was a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">A: No, well except when he -- except when he got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">A: Had his own two -- two children, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">A: Three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3444">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s3445">Now, I understand that you -- you all moved in August of 1948 to Arizona because your father was diagnosed with a heart condition, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3446">A: Well, he had a heart condition in -- in St-Germain-de-Calbert already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: And he had seen the doctor over there, and they couldn't do too much over there.</span> <span id="s3449">We came over here, and he was here in the winter of ’46, and we came here in ’48 -- yeah, ’47 was bad also, doctor says get out of New York, go to wa-warm climate.</span> <span id="s3450">So what he did, we wrote to chambers of commerce in Arizona, New Mexico, California and Colorado.</span> <span id="s3451">And we asked what is situation for jobs and housing.</span> <span id="s3452">Now remember that this was a time when many soldiers were being discharged, and they were looking for housing too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3454">A: So it was a competition and for jobs.</span> <span id="s3455">And they were all discouraging except Arizona.</span> <span id="s3456">The respondent said, there’s always an opportunity.</span> <span id="s3457">Come and see for yourself.</span> <span id="s3458">And so his relatives in New York said, you go to Arizona?</span> <span id="s3459">Aren’t you afraid of the Indians?</span></p> <p><span id="s3460">Q: Out of the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">A: Of the Indians?</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">Q: Indians.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">A: Yeah, Arizona?</span> <span id="s3464">So my father says look, I crossed the ocean to see the Statue of Liberty, and [indecipherable] Indians.</span> <span id="s3465">And he came back [indecipherable] he didn’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s3466">He went to a Jewish organization and they send him to a -- [indecipherable] presidents who told him to check [indecipherable] to a real estate agent who will find a place for us.</span> <span id="s3467">And they -- he made a lot of connections over here.</span> <span id="s3468">He was the kind of a person to -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s3469">Q: To do that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">A: -- he gets along, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">Q: Did he speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">A: Not much, not much.</span> <span id="s3473">But to some of the people he could speak [indecipherable] too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">A: So you know, no problem.</span> <span id="s3476">And then after a few weeks he had rented a store and then we came over here too.</span> <span id="s3477">And the first thing we did is buy some radio equipment -- equipment to repair radios.</span> <span id="s3478">[indecipherable] check tubes, radio tubes and -- and al-all that.</span> <span id="s3479">And since I’d been [indecipherable] I knew all about that.</span> <span id="s3480">So we opened up the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3481">Q: So you s -- so you started open -- repairing radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s3482">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3483">Q: You started repairing radios?</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">A: Yes, uh-huh, yeah.</span> <span id="s3485">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">Q: And are you all -- you’re all living together now?</span> <span id="s3487">Your sister and your si --</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">A: Oh no, well we -- she’s in Phoenix.</span> <span id="s3489">And she has two children who live separate each one because they are unmarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s3490">Q: No, I mean when you moved --</span></p> <p><span id="s3491">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3492">Q: -- in 1948 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3493">A: Oh, oh, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s3494">Q: -- did you all live together for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s3495">A: -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3496">Q: And when did you -- your sister got married --</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">A: We came here probably in August sometimes, I think.</span> <span id="s3498">In ’40 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">Q: ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">A: ’48.</span> <span id="s3501">And she got married in February of ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s3502">Q: Uh-huh, so it was pretty soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3504">We went to a synagogue over there on services, and she met this young man, and just --</span></p> <p><span id="s3505">Q: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3506">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3507">Q: So she -- but she remained in Arizona?</span></p> <p><span id="s3508">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3509">Q: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s3510">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3511">Q: So you all remained close.</span></p> <p><span id="s3512">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3513">Q: And you met someone -- I gather you were almost a confirmed bachelor by your own description, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3514">A: You got that right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3515">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3516">But in 1962 you met a woman named Marilyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s3517">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3518">Q: No, you met her earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s3519">A: No, I met her at least about in the 50’s -- late 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">A: What happened is she came with her parents from New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s3522">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3523">A: And lived in our neighborhood, and we knew a person across the street from there and he said -- he came over to me, “Fred, this young lady came from New York, she doesn’t know anybody, can you take her to the Jewish center to introduce her to young people, her age?”</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3525">A: Said sure.</span> <span id="s3526">You know, I -- I wouldn’t pay attention to me, after all, she is 16, I’m 26, you know, it’s just like, when you’re 90 and a hundred it doesn’t make a difference --</span></p> <p><span id="s3527">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3528">A: -- between 16 and 26?</span> <span id="s3529">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">Q: [indecipherable] it makes a big difference, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3531">A: Okay, so I took her down there, she met people there, and then she met -- she finally married someone that she knew in New York but had come out here.</span> <span id="s3532">And when he passed away about a few years later, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3533">Q: So they weren't married for very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s3534">A: No.</span> <span id="s3535">Maybe five, six years, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s3536">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3538">Then she came by the store, I had the radio store downtown, and she had a baby carriage and the wheel broke off right in front of the store.</span> <span id="s3539">So I happened to see it, so I said okay [indecipherable] I take you home.</span> <span id="s3540">Put the cart --</span></p> <p><span id="s3541">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3542">A: -- and the baby -- and then after that I met her once at a dance somewhere, she was with her brother and I was with my sister and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3543">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3544">A: And then her brother says, let’s go for a pizza, you know?</span> <span id="s3545">And from then on, we start talking and I had a day off on Wednesday afternoon from work.</span> <span id="s3546">I said, hey, how about taking the kids for a wal -- you know, mountain climbing or an -- she said sure.</span> <span id="s3547">And we got acquainted, and she [indecipherable], I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">Q: And you got -- so you got married in 1962.</span></p> <p><span id="s3549">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3550">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3551">And unfortunately she died a few years ago, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3552">A: Yes, eight years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3553">Q: Was it eight years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s3554">A: Eight?</span> <span id="s3555">No, six year -- six years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">Q: Six years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">A: Six years ago, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3558">Q: And did you stay in the radio business all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">A: Yes, and I opened up the first TV store in Phoenix.</span></p> <p><span id="s3560">Q: The first TV store, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">A: They had -- did not have much -- at that time they had the pattern, you know the test pattern they used to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">Q: Yeah, yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">A: And that’s all the people saw all the time.</span> <span id="s3564">And they came in, when are they going to show the picture, when are they going to show the picture, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3565">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3566">A: And when they finally came in a few months later, the TV station was built on top of the biggest hotel in Phoenix at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3567">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">A: And so that was that.</span> <span id="s3569">I went almost out of radio business to get the TV business.</span> <span id="s3570">Then after a few years, this -- no, I -- what happened is when I got married to Marilyn, I married her in July of ’62.</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3572">A: But I said, you know, and I had been taking her and the kids out for weeks, for -- I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s3573">I have to leave more time free.</span> <span id="s3574">I’m not going to have somebody call me at 10 -- 11 o’clock at night that they missed their football or boxing or whatever it is, and I want to have my weekends also.</span> <span id="s3575">And that’s the only way I can marry someone, we’ll have some free time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3576">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3577">A: And then I worked for Motorola.</span></p> <p><span id="s3578">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3579">A: And we got married after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3580">Q: And what were you doing for Motorola?</span></p> <p><span id="s3581">A: I was a reliability engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3582">Q: A what?</span> <span id="s3583">A liability?</span></p> <p><span id="s3584">A: Reliability.</span> <span id="s3585">Quality control, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3586">Q: Oh, reliability engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3587">A: Quality control.</span></p> <p><span id="s3588">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3589">A: And you know, we had the [indecipherable] two and [indecipherable] three rockets?</span></p> <p><span id="s3590">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3591">A: And I was in charge of the controls, the quality of the semiconductors that went into the computers.</span> <span id="s3592">If that failed, it could be a real problem, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3593">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3594">A: So and then those [indecipherable] one, two and three were obsolete and then I got -- I lost the area of responsibilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s3595">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">Q: Ho-How do you think the war -- I don’t even know if this is a question anybody can answer.</span> <span id="s3598">Ho-How do you think the war changed your life or affected your life afterwards, or did -- do you not think about it that much?</span></p> <p><span id="s3599">A: I think about it every time I see a war going on someplace else.</span> <span id="s3600">Oh, only I forgot to tell you, I lived in a big apartment of 11 rooms, across the street from the general’s headquarter in Montpellier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">Q: This in -- this is in Montpellier?</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">A: And there was two sides to it, one had four rooms -- five rooms, the other one six rooms.</span> <span id="s3605">The lieutenant and his wife had one side, and I was on the other side with my parents.</span> <span id="s3606">The lieutenant was transferred out, he was a military justice officer, and I had a whole 11 rooms there.</span> <span id="s3607">One day a colonel from the headquarter says, “Loewy, I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s3608">Your apartment, I want it.</span> <span id="s3609">I’ll give you one month to find another apartment.”</span> <span id="s3610">I said, he had collaborated with the Germans and he wants me to give him the apartment?</span> <span id="s3611">No way.</span> <span id="s3612">A month goes by, “Loewy, have you found something?”</span> <span id="s3613">I said no.</span> <span id="s3614">He said, “I’ll find something for you.”</span> <span id="s3615">So he finds something and he says, “Loewy, I want you to move out.”</span> <span id="s3616">I said, “I refuse.”</span> <span id="s3617">“You what?”</span> <span id="s3618">He’s -- what happened then?</span> <span id="s3619">Had me called before the commander of the garrison, colonel.</span> <span id="s3620">And they -- they say -- the two of -- I-I took an attorney with me.</span> <span id="s3621">I was cautious there.</span> <span id="s3622">You’re sure [indecipherable] give up the apartment?</span> <span id="s3623">I said, it’s not a military matter, it’s a civil matter.</span> <span id="s3624">Had nothing to do with [indecipherable] o-or anything else.</span> <span id="s3625">You are refusing?</span> <span id="s3626">Yes, I refuse.</span> <span id="s3627">And then the other colonel bawls me out.</span> <span id="s3628">Then I said to him, “Colonel, do you know your army regulations?”</span> <span id="s3629">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s3630">“And you Colonel, you know your army regulations?”</span> <span id="s3631">Yes I do.</span> <span id="s3632">“What right do you have to talk to me that way in front of a non-com?”</span> <span id="s3633">I said, “No, no, you cannot insult somebody in front of a lower rank military.”</span> <span id="s3634">He turned all colors.</span> <span id="s3635">And they send him out, and then that didn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s3636">At two o’clock in the afternoon I’m called to see the general, and the general says, “You got to get out of there.</span> <span id="s3637">You have to go out, period.”</span> <span id="s3638">I tell my parents [indecipherable] apartments, they said, “Let’s get out of here, forget about it.</span> <span id="s3639">Let him have it.”</span> <span id="s3640">I move out of there.</span> <span id="s3641">Before I move out, I have a friend of mine in
