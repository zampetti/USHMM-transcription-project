Mrs. Rose Fine, on March 10, 1982, with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s19">Mrs. Fine, could you tell me where and when you were born, and a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A:I was born in 1917 in a small city called Ozorkow [in Poland].</span> <span id="s21">It was not far from the big city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s22">My father was a shochet [ritual slaughterer], big scholar, and I had a very fine family.</span> <span id="s23">We were 10 children—six sisters, four brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q:Where were you in that family?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A:I was the seventh of the family.</span> <span id="s26">There were five married sisters and one married brother, and the rest, myself and three small brothers who were still single home at the time of the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s27">I attended public school, Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q:Could you describe for me your experience in the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A:Well, we felt anti-Semitism, not only in the school, but all over, as it was the way of our living in this country.</span> <span id="s30">Jews were not allowed to have any public positions, fireman or policeman or bus driver, no real legitimate big factory worker, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q:You mean they were not allowed to function in those jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A:No, they were not paid, not in the big places.</span> <span id="s33">[unclear] where people made a good living, Jews were not allowed.</span> <span id="s34">That’s why they were forced to find themselves like home jobs, like home tailors, home shoemakers.</span> <span id="s35">Of course, the majority of people were not very well off.</span> <span id="s36">There was a small amount of very rich people, a little bit amount of middle class people, and I guess the majority were not too comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q:About what part of your town was Jewish, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A:It was a small part.</span> <span id="s39">The Jews were concentrated in the middle of the city, while the rest of the city which was built 10, 15 years before they were started to build; these little houses, like private houses, were built by the people that had those big jobs in those factories.</span> <span id="s40">When Friday came and they got their pay, just like here, and they could count on it, where a Jew, if he finished a job, which was usually the way, I guess he never got paid on time, and then after, if he got after three months a check, and it was due two months after, and he needed the money, he went to the person to get the check.</span> <span id="s41">He also lost on that, because the one that was giving him the money also took a percentage of this check.</span> <span id="s42">So all around, it was a very hard, difficult country to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q:The middleman took out something from the check that the Jewish man got.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A:Of course, because this was his trade.</span> <span id="s45">He had the money, he did you the favor, and paid you the money before the time, so he also took a big chunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q:The Jews were concentrated in the center of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A:Almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q:Was this an old section of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A:Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s50">I wouldn’t say it.</span> <span id="s51">It was the place, it was called like, the middle city.</span> <span id="s52">Let’s call it the middle city.</span> <span id="s53">It wasn’t necessarily an older section, but the middle of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q:And did non-Jews shop in that area, or was it primarily Jewish trade and Jewish shops?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A:No, not primarily.</span> <span id="s56">We shopped together.</span> <span id="s57">It wasn’t a isolation like here, a ghetto.</span> <span id="s58">No, gentiles came to our stores; they came to Jewish tailors; they came to Jewish shoemakers.</span> <span id="s59">Anything else you want to ask me?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q:You were in a public school with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s61">Did you have friends who were non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A:I personally, because I came from a strictly Orthodox home, did not very closely associate with gentile people.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q:Was that your choice, or was that the choice of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A:No, we grew up that way.</span> <span id="s65">See, it wasn’t because I hated her or she hated me.</span> <span id="s66">It was just that we didn’t have that much in common in daily life, except the school, that she could become my personal friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q:So your personal friends were people who came from homes that were similar to yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A:That’s correct.</span> <span id="s69">Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q:And can you tell me about your religious upbringing, given your father’s position?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A:We were very religious.</span> <span id="s72">It was a religious home, and we were religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q:Did you have schooling for the religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s75">I went to a Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s76">I went to a strictly Orthodox Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q:And can you describe what kind of education?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A:Only Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s79">It was an only-girls school.</span> <span id="s80">It was so Orthodox that no boys and girls were together.</span> <span id="s81">The boys had the Talmud Torah and [unclear], and we had the Beth Jacob.</span> <span id="s82">It was a strictly Orthodox girls school.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q:And how many days a week did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A:We went after school, after our public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q:How many days a week did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A:Let’s say two, three hours after school.</span> <span id="s87">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s88">Maybe Friday not, because it was a short day.</span> <span id="s89">It’s so many years, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s90">Maybe Friday out of school, because we were preparing for Shabbos, but otherwise I think we went a whole week.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q:Can you tell me any more about your parents’ involvement at this time in the town, either with Jewish organizations, or even non-Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A:Yes, my father belonged to Agudas Yisrael.</span> <span id="s93">This was extreme Orthodox, being of Orthodoxy.</span> <span id="s94">My father was a big scholar, a very fine man.</span> <span id="s95">My mother was an eshes chayil [a woman of valor]; they don’t come today in this caliber.</span> <span id="s96">And my brothers and sisters, of course were very fine.</span> <span id="s97">My sisters wore wigs, and strictly Orthodox, Orthodox homes.</span> <span id="s98">This would be my background.</span> <span id="s99">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q:Not much, unless you can think of it.</span> <span id="s101">Did any of the men in your family ever serve in the National Army in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A:No.</span> <span id="s103">May I say that they did everything not to.</span> <span id="s104">The reason is because there was a very difficult problem to get kosher food in the army, and they did everything not to do it.</span> <span id="s105">And none of them was serving, because in my family there was only one brother that was at the age, because the other three were younger than me, and so were not at military age.</span> <span id="s106">But the one, or my brothers-in-law, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q:How were they able to get out of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A:They would fast and on diet for many, many weeks to get to the point where their weight was not acceptable.</span> <span id="s109">That’s how I remember it, but I also remember many people saying that they would pull teeth, or something like that.</span> <span id="s110">Now this is what I heard as a young girl.</span> <span id="s111">Or they would make themselves deaf in one ear.</span> <span id="s112">I don’t know why, don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s113">But with my family, this was the reason.</span> <span id="s114">And with other ones, I guess with all religious people, this was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q:Can you tell me when the news of the Nazi takeover in Germany first affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A:Me personally, there was talking, politics, people were standing on the corners and talking, and listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s117">It all began with the Crystal Night; it began in Germany, but seemed never, never to enter anybody’s imagination.</span> <span id="s118">Nobody could foresee, first of all, what would happen, because no human being could think that a human being can do to somebody whatever they did; and, as a matter of fact, this summer, my father and mother lived in a..</span> <span id="s119">.</span> <span id="s120">at summertimes we rented in the forest a room or two, and the family went for the summer to this forest, and on this particular Friday when the war broke out, I had...my youngest brother-in-law was then doing my father’s job already, helping.</span> <span id="s121">So we got up 5:00 in the morning, and I went with him to town.</span> <span id="s122">He was supposed to go to the slaughterhouse, and I was supposed to shop for Shabbos, and while we were walking, we heard the planes coming.</span> <span id="s123">And from the houses, people were saying: “Lay down, lay down!”</span> <span id="s124">So we laid down, and when they passed, we went.</span> <span id="s125">And when we got to the city there was already a big...the houses were closed, and policemen were standing outside, and the people were hiding.</span> <span id="s126">We felt already the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q:Are you talking of the invasion then?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A:Friday, it was September 9, and it was already a big...people ran to the stores, and bought whatever they could, and I asked my brother-in-law what to do, and he said, “Take a horse and a buggy and go back and bring Papa and Mama and the children back.”</span> <span id="s129">So this is what I did, and my father said, “No, it’s better, I think during a situation like this, it will be better up in the forest.”</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q:Had your parents suspected that this might happen, before?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A:Not all of a sudden, no.</span> <span id="s132">We didn’t think it’s so close.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q:The invasion of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A:No.</span> <span id="s135">Never, we never did.</span> <span id="s136">It was something that shocked us, shocked us.</span> <span id="s137">But my father said, “No, we’ll stay in the forest.</span> <span id="s138">I think at a time like this it will be better here.”</span> <span id="s139">And this is a Kapitel [chapter] for itself.</span> <span id="s140">It was a terrible tragedy; it was heartbreaking and soul-breaking and fortune-breaking and family-breaking and mind-breaking, and life-breaking, and it was the pits.</span> <span id="s141">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s142">It’s a long, long story.</span> <span id="s143">What do you want me to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q:Can you describe, continue to describe, in as much detail as you can, what happened after you decided to stay in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A:Yes, this is a very nice chapter.</span> <span id="s146">Anyway, as it was shortly before Rosh Hashonah [Jewish New Year], and while the Germans were coming, we were sitting there in this house, and my brother-in-law wore a black beard, and my father was laying in bed, and we went out to a well for water.</span> <span id="s147">Before that, there was like a position, because during the night we heard shots and shooting and shouting, and shouting and shooting but while were [what we’re?</span> <span id="s148">-ed.]</span> <span id="s149">in, we didn’t know what.</span> <span id="s150">It seems that was a position, and the Poles went away, or they ran away.</span> <span id="s151">But I went out with my brother-in-law for water.</span> <span id="s152">All of a sudden, three horsemen, Germans, came around, and one took out a gun, and pointed it at my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s153">I can see the hole.</span> <span id="s154">He said, “Wo sind die Polnish Soldaten?”</span> <span id="s155">That means, “Where are the Polish soldiers?”</span> <span id="s156">So he was scared; of course, he couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s157">So I said, “I don’t know where they are.</span> <span id="s158">They were here but they left.”</span> <span id="s159">And again he said it, “Wo sind die Polnish Soldaten?”</span> <span id="s160">I said, “I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s161">We knew they were here, but they are away now.”</span> <span id="s162">So he said, “Show me the way to Lodz, to the big city.”</span> <span id="s163">So I said, “I guess this will be the way.”</span> <span id="s164">He put the gun back, and he said, “Geht, geht, Ihr seit wohl Juden,” “Go, go, you are probably Jews.”</span> <span id="s165">And we went in, and from inside they looked out and saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s166">I tell you, I’ve seen the hole of that gun pointing to my brother-in-law’s head.</span> <span id="s167">Anyway, then they started to come to look for ammunition.</span> <span id="s168">We didn’t hide ammunition.</span> <span id="s169">Which Jew had ammunition to hide?</span> <span id="s170">But they came very tired, and they were full of sand.</span> <span id="s171">They must have come from some kind of position, some of those Germans, looking tired and exhausted.</span> <span id="s172">And my father was laying on the bed, and saw what wa-....</span> <span id="s173">They asked him if we had any ammunition, or I don’t remember what they asked, and they said, “What’s wrong with him?”</span> <span id="s174">So we said, “This is our father.</span> <span id="s175">He is sick.”</span> <span id="s176">So he said, “If he is sick, why can’t we shot him?”</span> <span id="s177">So we children made a wall, like this, and said, “If you want to shoot, shoot us.”</span> <span id="s178">My father’s face was yellow; I can tell you.</span> <span id="s179">Anyway, I guess after Rosh Hashonah...</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q:At that point, did the Germans leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A:Yes, they left.</span> <span id="s182">They didn’t do no harm to the people there, no.</span> <span id="s183">And we left after Rosh Hashonah, maybe after Yom Kippur, I don’t remember exactly, and we went home.</span> <span id="s184">My father was already ahead like a truck driver.</span> <span id="s185">The first Saturday they came in, and between the ones that came in was a boy; his father was a pastor in the German church.</span> <span id="s186">One sat with me; I sat in school here, and he sat behind.</span> <span id="s187">Many times they played cards, you know like I hid them.</span> <span id="s188">And he was already in that black S.S. uniform, and on the Sabbath, he cut my father’s beard.</span> <span id="s189">So my father said, “I’m not crying because it is Shabbos and you are cutting my heard.</span> <span id="s190">I’m crying because for the first time in my life, my beard sees the scissors or a knife, and on Shabbos.”</span> <span id="s191">Because everything they did, they did on the Holy Days and Shabbos, to break you with your spirit together.</span> <span id="s192">And then, things settled down.</span> <span id="s193">We had to leave our house, and we moved in with a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q:Why did you have to leave your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A:Because Germans moved in to the nice houses.</span> <span id="s196">So we moved in with our friends...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q:German who?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A:Germans, the poorer Germans from the city moved into houses.</span> <span id="s199">Then we had to move, not in the front, but only in the back, because we were not allowed to walk on the street, only in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q:These were Germans who were already living in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A:Volksdeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q:Oh, these were Volksdeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A:You were not allowed to walk on the street.</span> <span id="s204">You had to walk in the back.</span> <span id="s205">And our children, two boys, there was no money, because when you had a little money it was in the bank, and nobody would give it back.</span> <span id="s206">And my father had asthma.</span> <span id="s207">So our children went to work in a lumber.</span> <span id="s208">They brought a little of that thing to burn in the oven, the saw dust, it’s called, to burn in the oven.</span> <span id="s209">It was bad; it was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q:And was food rationed during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A:Oh yes, it was already rationed.</span> <span id="s212">While we lived so close, so many people, typhus started to come around.</span> <span id="s213">Anyway, before this, in 1941, my father died of a broken heart.</span> <span id="s214">He could not make...my father died of a broken heart.</span> <span id="s215">And my mother was left at 49 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q:Your father was a young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A:My father was older than my mother.</span> <span id="s218">My mother was his second wife.</span> <span id="s219">Then typhus started to spread up, because we didn’t have so much soap, and we lived together, and not enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q:At the time you are talking about, were only Jews in the area that you were moved into?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A:No, no, no.</span> <span id="s222">And now, the Germans found a house a little bit out of the city, and they called it a hospital.</span> <span id="s223">It was isolated, and this was supposed to be the place where they intended to make the ghetto.</span> <span id="s224">So while they were making, building the ghetto, they put this house and made out of it a hospital.</span> <span id="s225">And everybody that was stroken [sic] by the sickness was taken to this hospital.</span> <span id="s226">My father was for a long time asthma sick, and I was the one that made my father a needle in the vein, and in the flesh.</span> <span id="s227">And a friend of my father, that knew that, called me and said I should go into that hospital and help the people as much as I can.</span> <span id="s228">There was no Lysol even to wash the hands.</span> <span id="s229">Not a white apron.</span> <span id="s230">No doctor.</span> <span id="s231">There was only one doctor from our city, Mr. Goldstein, that was studying in Paris, but the [unclear] interrupted his study because he had to come back while the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q:So there was one Jewish doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A:Only Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s234">And then, after a short while, a Dr. Moskowicz came; he was from Germany, I think from Berlin.</span> <span id="s235">And these two doctors were taking care of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q:Where was the ghetto area that you are describing?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A:It was in, a little bit off our city...where my home was, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s238">Also, once there was a sick person in the city, the other people of the family were in an isolation house.</span> <span id="s239">Because the Germans were very much afraid of typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q:When they were building the ghetto, did they actually build a wall...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A:No, they didn’t build a ghetto.</span> <span id="s242">They took a certain street, two, three streets, and the houses.</span> <span id="s243">They took the Poles out, and emptied the houses, and one nice Friday, they took all the people, from whoever was left in the city, and they brought them into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q:How many Jews do you think were in the ghetto in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s246">All I know is before even this, a couple weeks before, on a Friday night, while we were still in the city, everybody had to come out of their houses, women, children, sick, healthy, and they took us on...I was in the hospital at the time...and they took us on horses and wagons, and whoever they could, they took, put away, and the rest was left in the houses, and after two or three weeks, they came into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s247">And that was the end of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q:Explain that to me.</span> <span id="s249">They took the people, including you...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A:No, I was working in the hospital, but my mother and my brothers were already in.</span> <span id="s251">My two brothers, the youngest, were already in a labor camp.</span> <span id="s252">But my mother and the youngest boy, he was 13 years old, one Friday they came in, and they rang a bell, like, and everybody had to come out of the houses.</span> <span id="s253">So, whoever they could, they took away, and whoever was left went back to the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q:And where did they take these people?</span> <span id="s255">Did you ever find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A:My mother was taken to Chelmno, with my 13-year-old brother, with two of my sisters, and the small children, and they were exterminated there.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q:So this is before the ghetto was actually formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A:This was before the ghetto was formed, right.</span> <span id="s259">To the ghetto went many only privileged, the younger ones, healthier ones, the ones that they thought that they would be able to use after the war for their benefit, which they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q:So was there anyone else left at home besides you, after this...</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A:In the ghetto I was with a brother-in-law and sister.</span> <span id="s262">Her two children went already with my mother, with a niece.</span> <span id="s263">Her parents were also, went already at that time.</span> <span id="s264">She was young.</span> <span id="s265">She lives now in some other section of Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s266">This is the only niece I have left from the whole family.</span> <span id="s267">And then the city was judenrein, Jewish-clean, and the ones that were left were concentrated in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q:This happened in 1941, this deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A:1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q:And then the formation of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q:And your father had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A:My father was gone, and this Friday, when they made the people come out, I heard in the ghetto what was going on, and my mother ran through the back field, and came to the door of the ghetto, but they were not allowed to open it.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q:Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s275">This was before the deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A:Before deportation.</span> <span id="s277">The first deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q:There was a deportation before the one where your mother was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A:This is the first deportation.</span> <span id="s280">So I was in the hospital, and my mother ran in the back side, through the field to the ghetto, but they were not allowed to open the ghetto doors, because they were afraid that the people would hide.</span> <span id="s281">So I ran out of the hospital, and the man at the gate was Mr. Dreihomen, and I said, “Look, with all I do here, I want my mother to be let in.”</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q:She came to the door of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A:Of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q:The hospital was in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s286">And they didn’t open the door, not the door, but the gate.</span> <span id="s287">And I said, “Mr. Dreihomen, for all I do, I want my mother here.”</span> <span id="s288">Anyway, my mother was there maybe two weeks, maybe three weeks, when they took us all out and they stamped us, A or B.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q:Your mother was let in?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q:And your little brother was also...there,-...</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A:My thirteen-year-old brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q:In the hospital, in the ghetto for a couple of weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A:Right.</span> <span id="s295">In this ghetto my sister, Teicha [?]</span> <span id="s296">lived with her husband.</span> <span id="s297">Her two children went away from there one day already.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q:So some of the Jews were already in the ghetto area, but not all of them.</span> <span id="s299">It had not been totally filled at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A:Right.</span> <span id="s301">Now listen to me.</span> <span id="s302">My mother was there two, three weeks, and they came to stamp us, like an “A” or a “B.”</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q:What did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A:In the beginning we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s305">“A” was all right.</span> <span id="s306">You would be all right for work.</span> <span id="s307">So, one day, they took us out again, everybody on the place [Platz, town square].</span> <span id="s308">There were small children, infants, because people had children no matter what.</span> <span id="s309">We were standing on the place around, and he said, “Krankenschwester, Nurse, come over!”</span> <span id="s310">I had to take a child from a mother.</span> <span id="s311">And I said, “I don’t want to do it myself.</span> <span id="s312">There is another one...let her do it.”</span> <span id="s313">I felt like... Anyway, all the sick people, the small children, had to go into the hospital, and the rest went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s314">Three days, not a little water for the children, they laid there, they cried themselves to sleep, they got up, cried themselves to sleep, until...</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q:Until they died?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A:Until they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q:Was anything actually ever done to them?</span> <span id="s318">Were they ever poisoned in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A:No, no, no.</span> <span id="s320">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s321">They were taken, they were taken away after a while.</span> <span id="s322">After a while they were taken away.</span> <span id="s323">They came with Panzer [armor-plated] trucks, very big military trucks, closed.</span> <span id="s324">And when they opened the door, you could smell chloroform.</span> <span id="s325">And they threw the people in, and away they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q:These were the ones who had not yet died?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A:No, they were the sick, the typhoid people, old people.</span> <span id="s328">As a matter of fact, there was in a small village behind our city.</span> <span id="s329">They brought old people from this village.</span> <span id="s330">They also brought them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q:But before they went on these trucks, they did not feed them in the hospital for several days?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A:No.</span> <span id="s333">Three days was nobody was allowed, it was called a Sperre [quarantine]; nobody was allowed to go out of the house for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q:And many of them died in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A:Yes, children, typhoid people died, there was like a spot typhoid.</span> <span id="s336">They died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q:And the people who lived through that period of time were put on the trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A:Right.</span> <span id="s339">One day, on March 5, I remember exactly the day...</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q:This was what year now?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A:1941.</span> <span id="s342">One March 5, in the morning, I had night duty, and it was 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s343">It was cold outside, frost...European frost.</span> <span id="s344">I remember the names of the people, many of them that were there, Surje Breitbart, [unclear], a daughter, Gebkowitch, [unclear], she was the daughter-in-law to the rich Prijonowskis; they were stricken with typhoid.</span> <span id="s345">I left 6:00, and another nurse came in to release me.</span> <span id="s346">My brother-in-law lived from the hospital like across the street in a room, and I came in and I had a hot cup of tea, and all of a sudden she said, “[unclear], come quick.”</span> <span id="s347">And in front of the hospital there were, I don’t remember how many there were, high wagons with horses.</span> <span id="s348">And the German said, I went in and he said that we should dress the people and bring them out.</span> <span id="s349">And there were like Jewish policemen, a sanitary committee it was called, and they were also there.</span> <span id="s350">So I said to them, “Go to the family.</span> <span id="s351">Let them give me a shirt or a coat; you cannot take out naked people.”</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q:This was everyone in the hospital they wanted to take out?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A:Right.</span> <span id="s354">But the relatives of these typhoid-stricken people were waiting already outside to be taken with them.</span> <span id="s355">They were in an isolation house, the relatives.</span> <span id="s356">So, while they were preparing the sick people, they stood already in line.</span> <span id="s357">So I didn’t have anything to put on those people, because they didn’t have anything either.</span> <span id="s358">And these people were taken out, I swear to you, on the ice, barefooted, put on these wagons with straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Tape 1 of 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q:This is tape 1, side 2, of an interview with Mrs. Rose Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A:My brother-in-law lived like across the street, where I lived with him in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s362">He also had the typhoid.</span> <span id="s363">Each typhoid case had to be reported.</span> <span id="s364">But while I worked in the hospital, the doctors did me a favor, and we kept him without reporting.</span> <span id="s365">Before he was really not completely out of it, one nice day, they called us out, because it was called an Appell, appeal, Appell [roll call].</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q:This is before or after, you were talking about the hospital being cleared?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A:No, after.</span> <span id="s368">I have another clearing-out also.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q:Could you finish telling me about what happened after the people were taken out of the hospital?</span> <span id="s370">You yourself felt that you were also going to be taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A:That’s right, that’s 100%.</span> <span id="s372">But while the last wagon moved away, and he went after, I went back to my brother-in-law’s house, and there I fainted.</span> <span id="s373">Like a let-down.</span> <span id="s374">In this brother-in-law’s house I lived, and this brother-in-law had typhoid.</span> <span id="s375">We hid it because I did so much for the people, the doctor allowed this case to be hidden.</span> <span id="s376">One nice morning, they called us out, and we had to walk in fives for two miles, beyond the city, where the electric building that supplied the city with electricity was standing...</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q:Who is this who had to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A:All the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q:All the Jews in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A:In the ghetto, yes.</span> <span id="s381">And when we arrived at this place, there were ten ropes prepared for ten people to be hung, and there, around and around, benches for the dignities [sic] to come to observe the beautiful scenery.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q:These were the dignitaries of the town, or Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A:No, Germans, military and town.</span> <span id="s384">Ten people from our city were brought out, their hands behind their backs.</span> <span id="s385">The crimes, one boy, his name was Hooser [?]</span> <span id="s386">, he had parents a half a mile out of the city, and he was not supposed to cross the border, but he wanted to see his father and mother, and one time they caught him.</span> <span id="s387">This was the crime that he was hung.</span> <span id="s388">One came from the ghetto, Kutno, in another city, who has relatives in our town, and they caught him there...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q:You mean coming into your ghetto to see his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A:Right.</span> <span id="s391">And he was hung.</span> <span id="s392">And one father of six children, his name was Hosan [?]</span> <span id="s393">.</span> <span id="s394">I went to school with one of his daughters.</span> <span id="s395">His wife and children had to look, they couldn’t look down.</span> <span id="s396">They had to look and see how their father was hung, because the crime was, he was a watchman over the isolation house of the families that had typhoid.</span> <span id="s397">In this house was a very rich lady, isolated, and she paid a lot of money to the German that was watching.</span> <span id="s398">And while the German looked away, no excuse me, while there was a letter put to the window to this house, and she went down with her son, and she disappeared from the ghetto, while the German looked away.</span> <span id="s399">And the Jew was punished for this crime by being hung.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q:Because he was supposed to be watching...</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A:Right.</span> <span id="s402">And after this beautiful ceremony, we went home, back to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q:This was in the early days of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A:Right.</span> <span id="s405">Maybe not early, I don’t remember exactly when.</span> <span id="s406">Well, after a while, one night, they called us out; it was 5:00, and we knew it was, we felt already it was the last trip.</span> <span id="s407">So, somebody had a little saccharin, a little barley, a piece of bread, and we had this in a bag.</span> <span id="s408">And while we were standing and waiting to be taken away, before they said that we should put the little packages down, the Polish neighbors were waiting outside the gate for us to be taken, that they should take the little bit of poor, little measly bite that we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q:You were being deported at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A:To the Lodzer Ghetto, to the big ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q:Now, after the emptying of the hospital that you described before, were you able to continue to work in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A:Yes, I did, I did, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q:Were people still being brought in?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s415">People that had from too little vitamins, they had holes in their feet, you know, so the doctor made all kinds of, whatever we could help them with, a bandage, or for big heart problems we had some digitalis, with this we healed.</span> <span id="s416">So whatever we had...</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q:You had a little bit of medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A:A little bit here, a little bit there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q:And then how long were you in the ghetto in your own town?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A:In my own town, maybe a year.</span> <span id="s421">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q:And about how many people do you think were left to be taken to Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A:Not many.</span> <span id="s424">We had to wait until 2:00 in the night because one Mr. Friedman was blind, so they shot him, and some people had to take him to the cemetery to be buried.</span> <span id="s425">And they took us to the Lodz Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q:Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s427">You still had a Jewish cemetery that you were allowed...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A:In the city was a cemetery, in our city was the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q:You were still allowed to bury the dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A:This Mr. Friedman was buried in the cemetery, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q:Was this allowed, for instance, for the people who were hung, or other people who died in the hospital?</span> <span id="s432">Were you able to have free access to the cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A:I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s434">My father was buried in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s435">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s436">I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q:Was there a Judenrat, was there a council in your ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A:Yes, there was, but there was a Mr. Bartusky, a lawyer, a very fine, refined man.</span> <span id="s439">Nothing wrong, nothing bad to say about him, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q:What did the Nazis ask of the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A:The Judenrat?</span> <span id="s442">Like, they wanted young men, the transfer of young men to be taken to work, which two of my brothers went, and let’s say, when the people were hung, he had to say, “This was done because the people did not observe the German law.</span> <span id="s443">And whoever will do that, this is going to be their end.</span> <span id="s444">That’s how the end is going to look.”</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q:Who had to say this?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A:Mr....</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q:The head of the Judenrat had to explain why these people were being punished?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A:Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q:Did you feel that he was a just man?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A:100%.</span> <span id="s451">There was a little some, let me tell you, at a time like this, there is such a saying in Polish, “[unclear],” “Through dead bodies to your life.”</span> <span id="s452">Life is very precious to people, and many people will go through dead people to the destination to save their lives.</span> <span id="s453">But nothing outstanding that I could say, not because I am Jewish, or because the people are from my city.</span> <span id="s454">But nothing like in the Lodz Ghetto, like in the camps, like in Auschwitz, nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q:What about the Jewish police that you mentioned before?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A:There’s nothing that I can point that they did bad.</span> <span id="s457">They wanted people, and they had to provide the people.</span> <span id="s458">Look, there’s nothing I can say, but nothing outstanding that I could point at these people that were bad; they did bad things.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q:Were they helpful to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A:They didn’t have reasons to be helpful, or ways to be helpful, or means to be helpful; no.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q:So this was about 1942 then?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A:1942, we went to the Lodz Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q:And how were you deported to Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A:In trolley cars.</span> <span id="s465">At two in the night you were taken to trolley cars, and we were taken to Lodz.</span> <span id="s466">It wasn’t long, like maybe three quarters of an hour, or so.</span> <span id="s467">We arrived in the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q:There was a trolley line that went to Lodz from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s470">And when I arrived, I remember, our city was a small city, and in Lodz in the ghetto there were people already for two years, starving.</span> <span id="s471">So while we were marching to our certain destination, I’ve seen people looking out of the window when they heard us walking, like you would take people out of caskets.</span> <span id="s472">This was the first time I met, we were not in that small city, we were not that very much worn out like they.</span> <span id="s473">And they took us to a, something like a jail, or something like that, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q:Did you know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A:No, nobody knew, no.</span> <span id="s476">When we arrived, we stood in a line, and out came Bubba, that was his name, I think, Bubba.</span> <span id="s477">He was the one that was above...for the Lodz Ghetto, and he said, “Anything anybody has—gold, silver, whatever you have—I want you to know we are taking you now into a place where we are going to x-ray you, and whatever we find on you that you didn’t give away, you are going to be shot!”</span> <span id="s478">And there were boxes standing, and whatever somebody had, they threw it in, they threw it in.</span> <span id="s479">Anyway, they took us to a place where there was a jail or a school; I don’t remember, it was such a long time ago.</span> <span id="s480">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s481">Anyway, in the morning, people came and they located us into a little house, and a little room, five people in a room, six people in a room, seven people in a room, and then the Lodz Ghetto began.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q:Who were you with in your family at this point?</span> <span id="s483">Was there anyone with you from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A:My niece was, my brother-in-law and my sister.</span> <span id="s485">And I was there until 1944, August.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q:Can you describe as much as you can about your experience in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A:It was a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s488">I was in school.</span> <span id="s489">I was very good in Polish.</span> <span id="s490">The language Polish I was excellent in.</span> <span id="s491">When I arrived, I went to a place, it was called Arbeit Einsatz [labor pool], where you were looking for work.</span> <span id="s492">So they sent me to dig graves in the cemetery, dig graves in cemetery.</span> <span id="s493">Well, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s494">People like having a stick in a sheet, and inside was laying the person, big as that.</span> <span id="s495">We were digging, digging, every three or four days, and I’ve seen that I am not going to make it.</span> <span id="s496">I am going to die.</span> <span id="s497">The wife of the president, Rumkowski, was a lawyer, a very educated person.</span> <span id="s498">I wrote a letter to her, and I told her that I am by myself, I don’t have anybody, and I was taken to this kind of a job, and I am heartbroken, I cannot make it.</span> <span id="s499">If it’s possible, she should give me a decent job.</span> <span id="s500">And nobody had a way to go to her.</span> <span id="s501">I had a package of cigarettes, and there was a boy that was like a bus boy.</span> <span id="s502">I gave him these cigarettes, and I said, “Look, I don’t want this secretary,”—Miss Hychevage [?]</span> <span id="s503">was her name; “I want this letter to go straight to Mrs. Rumkowski.”</span> <span id="s504">Eight early in the morning, somebody knocked at the door, and it was him.</span> <span id="s505">She made me an appointment that I should come to her office.</span> <span id="s506">So I came in; it was a beautiful office.</span> <span id="s507">She was already in mourning; it was black... She married this man because she had a father and a brother that she wanted to save, because he was president, and of course, they lived nice and good, so she married him in order to save, you know, so they could live in a better conditions, but they died anyway.</span> <span id="s508">When I saw her she was in black.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q:They were deported, or they died in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A:They were deported to Auschwitz; no, they died in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s511">Her father and brother died in the ghetto, died because of sickness.</span> <span id="s512">She was deported to Auschwitz, with Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q:But she married Rumkowski at that time for that reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A:Right, right.</span> <span id="s515">And we sat, a very nice lady, and we spoke, we spoke, and she directed me to a kitchen.</span> <span id="s516">A job like this, you know, who could get, in the ghetto, could have it, a wife of a big manufacturer, a very known person.</span> <span id="s517">Anyway I was lucky enough to get a job like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q:Was she a young woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A:Yes, young, very intelligent, extremely passionate [personable?]</span> <span id="s520">and sensitive and intelligent.</span> <span id="s521">She wore a big diamond, I seen on her finger, I remember like now.</span> <span id="s522">A very fine person.</span> <span id="s523">And who was I to her that she should, you know, and once, after a long while working there, and what I did for people at that time, God should pay me my old age, I hope.</span> <span id="s524">I didn’t do it for any work, but I hope He will pay me for it.</span> <span id="s525">And one day, a man came in, he was supposed to be Rumkowski’s brother, and he made like a cleaning.</span> <span id="s526">He took some people out.</span> <span id="s527">They had more important people to put in, and I was out.</span> <span id="s528">So, it was summer, and they lived in a Marsiny [?]</span> <span id="s529">, it was called, in a summer place.</span> <span id="s530">So I was waiting at the gate while he and her came out in a beautiful black carriage with horses, and I threw my letter—because he didn’t let the carriage stop—I threw my letter on her lap, like passing by, and I was taken back.</span> <span id="s531">And until the end of the, the liquidation of the ghetto, I worked in that kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q:The summer home that they were in, was this outside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s533">Or part of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A:No in the ghetto, part of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q:And it was removed from a congested area?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A:No.</span> <span id="s537">The ghetto was big.</span> <span id="s538">The ghetto was very big.</span> <span id="s539">But they lived there I guess during the summer.</span> <span id="s540">And I wanted to let her know that they eliminated me, and while they were going out, and he didn’t want to stop, I threw the letter, and sure enough she took it.</span> <span id="s541">In the liquidation of the ghetto, I was, until I was taken, and I was going to Auschwitz, I was working in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q:What did you know of Rumkowski himself, and the workings of that man?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A:Not much.</span> <span id="s544">You know why, because everybody was busy with the piece of potato, waiting in lines for the frozen potato, and you know, waiting in line for the gas, because if you had a gas burner, for the time, for half an hour, you were waiting and praying that the water should boil until that time, you were so...I just told you, that the desire to live is very strong in a person.</span> <span id="s545">Nothing bothered you there.</span> <span id="s546">You survive, think, this was the main, main, main...I guess it’s human nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q:What details can you give me about the kitchen, as far as what was gotten, and how you made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A:Let’s say, the president was a big Mr. Saida.</span> <span id="s549">He was a very big, must have been a big man in the ghetto, not in the ghetto, but in Lodz.</span> <span id="s550">Otherwise he wouldn’t get a position like this.</span> <span id="s551">And all the people that were there were privileged people, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s552">There was a cook, and there were factories, people working, and 12:00 we took our big things and we wheeled them there, and dumped them out in big pots, and with a certain measure, everybody came in, and had a ticket, and got a soup.</span> <span id="s553">The piece of potato that was in that soup was to be found, or not to be found, believe me.</span> <span id="s554">The way the men stood and looked at the piece of potato with the spoon.</span> <span id="s555">That’s how, what can I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q:This is primarily what you were cooking, potato soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A:Water, and potato soup, and cabbage, and when we received some bones, let’s say, from a horse or whatever it was, it was cooking the whole night, because horse meat takes very long.</span> <span id="s558">The president was there all night.</span> <span id="s559">The meat was taken by the president and by the cook, and we were taken to one separate room, and we were taking the meat off the bones, and believe me, some went in my pocket, and in this pocket, and what the person outside saw was a plain, clean bone, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q:None of that meat got into the soup itself?</span> <span id="s561">Not too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A:Let’s say no.</span> <span id="s563">We had a man that was working in that factory, and of course, they were privileged, and they came, the potatoes came from the bottom and taken to [unclear].</span> <span id="s564">And the workers stood and said, “Where are the potatoes?”</span> <span id="s565">And he said—I remember his name, but I don’t want to mention it—he said, “Eat stones!”</span> <span id="s566">But he had already the potatoes!</span> <span id="s567">Anyway, August 1942, I went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q:August 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A:No, ‘44.</span> <span id="s570">I went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q:Before we get to Auschwitz, is there anything else that you can tell me about Lodz and the experiences you had there, or what you observed, about the treatment of the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A:It was terrible.</span> <span id="s573">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s574">I used to make needles [give injections].</span> <span id="s575">As I told you about my father.</span> <span id="s576">When I went from the ghetto, there was a little box, and I had the needle there, and the things there, because we had to cook it in a spoon of water...</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q:You’re talking about a syringe?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s579">I had it with me.</span> <span id="s580">So while I was in the ghetto, a man came to me and said, “Rushka,” is my name, he remembered that I made needles, and he said, “Please do me a favor.</span> <span id="s581">My wife is very sick.</span> <span id="s582">I have the thing, I have the medicine, just come and do it for me.”</span> <span id="s583">So we went to the back, and all the fences were off, because people took them to burn in their houses, you know, to heat the houses.</span> <span id="s584">I passed by, and through a window I saw a man laying there.</span> <span id="s585">I don’t know how long he was dead, but he was half eaten by the flies, half eaten by the flies.</span> <span id="s586">What other experience should I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q:Tell me what you can about the children.</span> <span id="s588">Was there any organization that you knew of to teach them?</span> <span id="s589">To keep them together?</span> <span id="s590">To fortify them in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A:All I know that you could see them.</span> <span id="s592">They were dressed in rags, and they were like, like, like dead.</span> <span id="s593">They grew up before their age.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q:Was there any teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A:I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q:Was there any religious activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A:I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q:Did you celebrate any of the traditional observances?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A:As much as I could, that is very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q:Were you aware of having contact with a rabbi, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A:I had a brother-in-law, and they were also hidden themselves; they also watched their skin.</span> <span id="s602">I had one brother-in-law that was in the ghetto that, if you didn’t go to work, you didn’t receive that soup.</span> <span id="s603">So on Shabbos, my brother-in-law did not work, and he didn’t have the soup.</span> <span id="s604">That’s what you had to sacrifice.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q:You said that you don’t remember any kind of religious observance on a group scale, and you did what you could personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A:That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q:Are there any other details...</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A:The ghetto was a terrible experience, but it’s nothing to begin with, and nothing to start with.</span> <span id="s609">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s610">People were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s611">Death was a consolation, because you saw them with feet like that, and with stomachs like that, and eyes like that.</span> <span id="s612">And the shmattes that they had, the rags, were worn out already, through the years like rags.</span> <span id="s613">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q:Was there a difference socially among the people in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s615">Were certain people who were wealthier have a different position in the ghetto than the poorer people?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s617">People that had, let’s say, wealth, could still buy a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s618">People sold, or some people had privileged jobs there.</span> <span id="s619">They used to have more food and so.</span> <span id="s620">If you had, there were times that you could better yourself.</span> <span id="s621">But not many had.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q:Were you aware of what was going on outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A:No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q:There was no communication from outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A:None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q:Did you know about what was going on in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A:No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s628">I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q:You thought that was as bad as it was going to get?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A:No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q:The Lodz Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q:What did you think was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A:Nobody knew, nobody.</span> <span id="s635">This is beyond human imagination.</span> <span id="s636">Nobody knew, nobody.</span> <span id="s637">Nobody could ever, ever think of something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q:Did you have any contact with the Polish population at the time that you were in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q:Just the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A:No Polish, no.</span> <span id="s642">This was a closed ghetto.</span> <span id="s643">Closed, closed ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q:Were you aware of anybody else who had any contact with the Poles who might have tried to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A:No, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s646">I came from a city where no Pole helped a Jew.</span> <span id="s647">There were in other cities people who helped, single people.</span> <span id="s648">But in my city, nobody helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q:In your own hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q:And also not in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A:Lodz, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s653">I came to the ghetto, so I didn’t have any contact with nobody but Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q:And was there a difference between your own ghetto police and those that you found in Lodz, the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A:I didn’t have much contact.</span> <span id="s656">I went my way.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q:You were working how many hours a day in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A:I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q:And was there any other kind of activity...</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A:I had, don’t forget I had a very privileged job.</span> <span id="s661">I was between the very privileged ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q:Was there any other activity for you outside of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q:Was there anything that you found, any group of people that you found?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A:No.</span> <span id="s666">We were just people, we were just happy enough to rest your bones and get up in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q:And your other family members, your brother-in-law, and sister, they were also working?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A:Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s669">Everybody was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q:So now you are telling me about the deportation in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A:1944, that was the deportation.</span> <span id="s672">I went almost with the last, when the hospital was transferred to Auschwitz, I went.</span> <span id="s673">Almost the last day, I left the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q:Did you know at that point where the other transports had gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A:No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s676">I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q:Was your family still with you, or had they been already evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A:Only one person...it was impossible to hide, it was impossible to hide already, because there were dogs after us, and if you would be hidden there, in the basement...one day I was in the basement, and we heard them walking, the Germans, looking in the houses.</span> <span id="s679">One morning, across the street, the door was open, the people were gone in the middle of the night, so you went.</span> <span id="s680">And the day when I went, there were already placards on the street that anybody who was to be deported would be shot if they didn’t go.</span> <span id="s681">So we took our things, and we went to the station.</span> <span id="s682">Went to the station, went on the famous wagons, you know, and then we were taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q:When you say the famous wagons, you are referring to the closed cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A:The closed cars, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q:And what do you remember about that trip?</span> <span id="s686">How long was it, and what...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A:We arrived 4:00 in the morning...</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q:You had started out at when?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A:I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s690">Anyway, when we arrived, it was raining, and we were standing on the side.</span> <span id="s691">While we were coming down from the train, the Germans stood there and they said, “Women separate, men separate!”</span> <span id="s692">And from far away we heard cling, cling, cling, and we would see people like from a Byberry’s [mental institution in Northeast Philadelphia]—no hair, no shoes, run out from houses, and about 7:00 they opened the wagons, we came down, men separate, women separate, and I was taken to a shower...</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q:The people that were running down when the bell rang, were who?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A:They were the people in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q:They came to see...this was for the...</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A:No, they went out for the water, like for the little coffee, for the little...they were counting you.</span> <span id="s697">You had to stay.</span> <span id="s698">Twice a day you had a counting.</span> <span id="s699">So at 5:00 they rang, the people came out, and they counted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q:And you could see this from the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A:I’ve seen it, but I didn’t understand what it was.</span> <span id="s702">So we came down from the train, and they took us to a shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q:Was there any selection before the shower, when you got off the train?</span> <span id="s704">Was there any kind of division?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A:Yes, certainly, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q:There was a selection immediately.</span> <span id="s707">Were you still with any of your family when you were taken at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A:No, I was already alone.</span> <span id="s709">Well, my mother wasn’t there anymore, of course, and nobody from my family.</span> <span id="s710">I was alone.</span> <span id="s711">My sister, my brother-in-law, and my niece went to Auschwitz a day before I went, and then after the selection, we were taken to out bath.</span> <span id="s712">We were undressed on this side, took a bath, and went out the other side.</span> <span id="s713">On the other side there stood a table with some dresses, and a dress was thrown to you.</span> <span id="s714">I had a black dress, a long black dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q:These were regular civilian clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A:This was clothes that were taken from the people that they exterminated.</span> <span id="s717">She threw a dress, I had a black dress.</span> <span id="s718">And from there we were taken to a barrack.</span> <span id="s719">And I was in Auschwitz eight days.</span> <span id="s720">After the eighth day...</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q:During that eight days, what was your daily pattern like?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A:My daily pattern, we received in the morning, we had to go for water, and water and leaves, and this was the breakfast.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q:What did you do with the water and leaves?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A:Drink it.</span> <span id="s725">This was a drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q:You would cook the leaves in the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A:No, it was hot.</span> <span id="s728">It was in hot pots, water and leaves, I don’t know, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s729">And then they brought in soup, and we drank from one pot...</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Tape 2 of 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q:This is tape 2, side 1, of an interview with Mrs. Rose Fine on March 10, 1982, with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s732">We were talking about the soup that you were given.</span> <span id="s733">This was at what time of the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A:About 12:00, or 1:00, we had all the soup in one pot.</span> <span id="s735">There were no spoons, so we went around, five people, everybody had one lick, one swallow.</span> <span id="s736">The soup was made with a special, I don’t know what was in it, to make us thirsty, but there was no water.</span> <span id="s737">The thirst was burning our hearts out.</span> <span id="s738">No water.</span> <span id="s739">Because August, was hot outside.</span> <span id="s740">We would lay like snakes in the sand.</span> <span id="s741">No water.</span> <span id="s742">And the bathroom, we had to go by the whole Block.</span> <span id="s743">And there was a place that had holes in the floor, and you had to take this many minutes, and no more.</span> <span id="s744">Otherwise, there were sticks running over your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q:There were just holes in the floor.</span> <span id="s746">There was no plank, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A:No.</span> <span id="s748">Just a hole.</span> <span id="s749">And when you weren’t ready at this time, you received one over your head with a wood piece, a piece of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q:How many women were in each barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A:Many, many.</span> <span id="s752">We were laying like herrings, like sprats [young herring] in a box.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q:Were you more than one person to a bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A:No bed.</span> <span id="s755">We were laying on the floor.</span> <span id="s756">There were no beds.</span> <span id="s757">There was a floor, like a pavement, cement.</span> <span id="s758">And we were laying on this floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q:No bunks of any kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A:No bunks.</span> <span id="s761">So one morning, they brought in pieces of blankets, scraps of blankets, and one girl, one lady, she was maybe 35, or closer to 40, she took a piece of blanket and wrapped it around her kidneys, and she was the one chosen to go for that water for the breakfast tea.</span> <span id="s762">By the way, the way to the kitchen was plastered with small stones, and we didn’t have no shoes.</span> <span id="s763">We were walking barefeeted.</span> <span id="s764">And when she was going back, a piece of the blanket showed out of her dress, and a lady Gestapo followed her to the Block.</span> <span id="s765">She came into the Block, and through the Block, there was a big chimney, and she asked her to lay herself over the chimney, and took a piece of stick, and beat her as long until the mucus started to come out of her face, out of her mouth, and then she took her boots and stepped on her neck.</span> <span id="s766">This was because she took a piece of blanket that was permitted to do so.</span> <span id="s767">One nice day, we were taken to a place, and by fives put into lines while we were waiting, and in came Mengele with a tall blonde lady.</span> <span id="s768">I was a tall girl always.</span> <span id="s769">While in the ghetto, there was a rumor that young people were going to be taken to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s770">I took stone, I crushed it, and with Vaseline I made an ointment, and I put it all over my body, so that every piece of stone made a little Geschwür [sore].</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q:Mark.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A:A mark.</span> <span id="s773">And the breast is very delicate—this ate holes out of my breasts.</span> <span id="s774">And while I was waiting in that line, I held my hands across, because I did not want them to see the marks on my breasts.</span> <span id="s775">So, Mengele arrived with that lady, and she said to him, I heard, she said, “Nice material, schöne Ware,” she said.</span> <span id="s776">Then she said, “Why are you holding your hands like that?”</span> <span id="s777">I said, “I’m cold.”</span> <span id="s778">And then from there we were given wooden shoes, like Holland shoes, and a piece of salami, and piece of margarine and a piece of bread, and we were taken into trains, like into open trains, like the horse trains, you know, and we were taken to Freiberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q:Just a minute.</span> <span id="s780">Why did you put the salve that you described on your body?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A:The healthy ones were taken to a working camp.</span> <span id="s782">All right.</span> <span id="s783">Well, if you weren’t 100% clean, they wouldn’t take you.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q:You thought that it would be more dangerous to go to a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A:That’s correct.</span> <span id="s786">I didn’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q:And they discovered the marks?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A:No, they didn’t have a chance.</span> <span id="s789">I just did it for a precaution.</span> <span id="s790">But it never came to existence.</span> <span id="s791">But it left me with marks between my breasts.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q:So they sent you anyway, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A:But she said to me, “Why are you...” so I said, “I am cold.”</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q:And they never checked?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A:No.</span> <span id="s796">And then they took us to Freiberg.</span> <span id="s797">Freiberg, we worked in an airplane factory.</span> <span id="s798">And the food, of course, water, and water, and a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q:Only water?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A:Well, then some cabbage water, and I don’t know, kohlrabi water, and who knows what, and a piece of bread, and a potato on Sunday.</span> <span id="s801">And one Christmas it was very cold.</span> <span id="s802">Everybody went home from the Germans, and we were watched by two S.S. ladies.</span> <span id="s803">So instead of leaving us home, she took us out.</span> <span id="s804">We didn’t have more than the Holland shoes, and no underpants, just the dress.</span> <span id="s805">Nothing on our heads, the heads shaved.</span> <span id="s806">She took us out in the fields, and asked us to take out the roots of the flowers by hand.</span> <span id="s807">When we came back, I can tell you, we started to holler so that heaven heard us.</span> <span id="s808">It made no difference.</span> <span id="s809">They would shoot us, and it would make no difference.</span> <span id="s810">Anyway, I worked there until...</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q:What kind of living conditions did you have in Freiberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A:I lived in a barrack.</span> <span id="s813">Then we had bunks made of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q:Now were you working only with women at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A:Women and Italian soldiers that were kept, captured, and German bosses, German foremen, and girls.</span> <span id="s816">But we were the only ones, let’s say there were factories where Poles worked, but they were free people.</span> <span id="s817">We were the only ones that we were always closed, and never free.</span> <span id="s818">We never knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q:This specific factory was closed only to the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A:Yes, for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q:And can you describe your treatment here, as compared to Auschwitz, in terms of the German...</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A:You see, we were working here.</span> <span id="s823">I used to get up 5:00 in the morning, and they counted us.</span> <span id="s824">And then we went to get our piece of bread and water, and whoever could keep a piece of bread for later, but not many could.</span> <span id="s825">And during the day we received that soup.</span> <span id="s826">And then we came in and laid on the bunks, and we talked, and we baked and we cooked in our mind fascinating... And early in the morning, across the street was a washroom, like washing with water, spigots with water, and no matter how cold it was, we had to go under the cold water from the top to bottom, because we had no soap, so that lice shouldn’t have a place to go.</span> <span id="s827">But we were used to it; you get used to it.</span> <span id="s828">And I worked there until March of 1945.</span> <span id="s829">March 1945, before even, I stopped working.</span> <span id="s830">My legs gave up.</span> <span id="s831">So they took me to a Revier, to a hospital, and I hurt.</span> <span id="s832">I saw what I looked like, because the shades were dark, you know, just like in here, and I saw bombs and bombs and bursting bombs and bursting bombs, and the hospital was shaking, but we did not know what the progress is.</span> <span id="s833">Anyway...</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q:Did you have any idea while you were in Freiberg or while you were in Auschwitz what was going on outside the camp?</span> <span id="s835">Was there any word?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A:Not much, no.</span> <span id="s837">Let’s say like we walk, we see some...from Freiberg, we would see like another group of people going to work, and we would ask, “Did you see this one?</span> <span id="s838">Did you see that one?”</span> <span id="s839">you know like, only like passing by.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q:Did you have any contact with the family of yours that had arrived there earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A:No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q:Did you know about the gas chambers?</span> <span id="s843">Did you know about the ovens?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A:Yes, I know, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q:When did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A:In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q:In Auschwitz you found that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A:In Auschwitz I know.</span> <span id="s849">Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q:Let me ask you one other question.</span> <span id="s851">What was keeping you going during this time?</span> <span id="s852">Your family was gone...</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A:My faith.</span> <span id="s854">I wanted to live and see if still somebody was... The desire to live is very strong.</span> <span id="s855">Many a girls got up, and when we got up in the morning to see them hanging on the wire, and their bodies were like charcoal.</span> <span id="s856">I figured, God gave it to me, He has the right to take it.</span> <span id="s857">But many a time you think...but there is always hope.</span> <span id="s858">You know, you never know.</span> <span id="s859">Why you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s860">Nothing definite.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q:Did you continue to pray during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A:I always did, as much as I could.</span> <span id="s863">You know I have faith in God, and I always figured, maybe somebody is alive, maybe somebody will live.</span> <span id="s864">You know, you always hope and pray.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q:Was there anybody within your barrack or within your working group at Freiberg who was a support to the rest of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A:Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s867">Everybody was busy with themselves, with the desire of living, and just live to the minute when you will be able to have a ladle of [unclear], which was, like you see the diamond, this is good soup that sticks to the spoon.</span> <span id="s868">This is stuff you have to live through to realize what I am saying.</span> <span id="s869">And one nice day, they picked us together and they took us on trains, and they took us from Germany to Austria.</span> <span id="s870">The journey took 27 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q:This was everyone that you were working with?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A:Yes, in this camp.</span> <span id="s873">They were evacuating the people.</span> <span id="s874">While the Americans came close to the German border, they evacuated us to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q:And how many people was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A:A lot of people.</span> <span id="s877">I don’t know, hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s878">They took us on trains, but we were very slow going.</span> <span id="s879">When we were going through Czechoslovakia...</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q:You said to Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A:Yes, to Mauthausen, I was liberated in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s882">While we were going to Czechoslovakia, we stood on the sidelines, because we could only pass while the train lines were empty.</span> <span id="s883">We could see soldiers and ammunition and food for the soldiers to the front.</span> <span id="s884">So while we were looking out, we seen a table, and Czechoslovakian women brought in potatoes and bread and cake, and I don’t know, whatever it was, from far away we couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s885">When they were ready to give it to us, he opened the door, and he said we should stand in line.</span> <span id="s886">Can you tame lions?</span> <span id="s887">When the door was open, a wagon of crazy, half dead people came.</span> <span id="s888">So he was ashamed himself what they saw, he locked the door.</span> <span id="s889">And we arrived in Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q:Did they give you any food or water?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A:When we went on the train, they gave us a piece of bread, a piece of salami, some little things.</span> <span id="s892">But we were very long on the train.</span> <span id="s893">I don’t remember how long, maybe 10 days, maybe more.</span> <span id="s894">So one day, he went down.</span> <span id="s895">He let the train was on an up.</span> <span id="s896">He went down, and they brought him a pitcher of water with parsley, and he disposed it between us, like a hot drink.</span> <span id="s897">Anyway we arrived at that Mauthausen, and to that Mauthausen they brought over thousands and thousands of people from all Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q:This was in March of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A:Yes, March of 1945.</span> <span id="s900">And people from all Germany came to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s901">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s902">A tragedy of the whole world.</span> <span id="s903">They baked bread from chestnuts, hot.</span> <span id="s904">The people were so sick they ate it.</span> <span id="s905">Everybody had bloody diarrhea.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q:They baked bread from chestnuts?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s908">And hot, because so many people.</span> <span id="s909">Who can supply, and the people ate it because they were so hungry, and everybody had bloody diarrhea.</span> <span id="s910">God, they gave you a bed in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s911">What a tragedy!</span> <span id="s912">What a tragedy!</span> <span id="s913">What an end!</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q:This was the most overcrowded camp, then, you had been in?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A:Yes, because, right, right.</span> <span id="s916">And we were liberated by the Americans there.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q:Was there much talking among the prisoners in Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A:I tell you, once I’ve seen a crematorium, and I’ve seen the dead in my eyes.</span> <span id="s919">We were in a barrack, and with me was a lady, her name was Mrs. Greengrass and her daughter, Bronka.</span> <span id="s920">She was a nurse in Lodz.</span> <span id="s921">And we were sleeping on one bunk, and we were talking, and we became very friendly.</span> <span id="s922">So one day, they chased us all outside, and into Bronka with her mother came a gentleman, and he said, “Bronka, take your mother and go inside.”</span> <span id="s923">So I said to myself, if she goes inside, I’ll go inside.</span> <span id="s924">And when we came inside, we heard a very big noise, like when you come into a chicken coop, the chickens run away.</span> <span id="s925">Well, whoever they caught, the crematorium was a half of a block from our Block.</span> <span id="s926">And at the end, while we were laying in this Block, I must tell you a story.</span> <span id="s927">We were laying on the floor, of course, and the corner was a little room, and Gypsies were the ones that watching over us.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q:Gypsies were your guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A:Yes, Gypsies with green corners.</span> <span id="s930">Yes.</span> <span id="s931">Gypsies, murderers.</span> <span id="s932">They were our guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q:Gypsy murderers?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A:Yes, were our guards.</span> <span id="s935">And so we were laying, and a lady lays next to me.</span> <span id="s936">There was a friend, Salla [?]</span> <span id="s937">, I was with her the whole time, and here another lady, and she said in the middle of the night, “Oh, my stomach!</span> <span id="s938">Oh, my stomach!”</span> <span id="s939">I said, “Lady, keep quiet.</span> <span id="s940">It will pass.</span> <span id="s941">Because they will come out and kill you.”</span> <span id="s942">And it passed.</span> <span id="s943">After 10 minutes she said, “Oh, my stomach!</span> <span id="s944">Oh, my stomach!</span> <span id="s945">I can’t take it!”</span> <span id="s946">It passed.</span> <span id="s947">The third time we heard a baby cry.</span> <span id="s948">So they came out, the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s949">Listen to what faith can do if God wants life.</span> <span id="s950">She cut here, and said, “Oh, a baby again.”</span> <span id="s951">She cut the cord, and I cut from my black dress plenty full lice, a piece, and she tied it.</span> <span id="s952">And they took her, in the back of it there were a couple pieces of wood, it was called like a hospital, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q:There were a couple of shelves?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A:Yes, this was called the hospital.</span> <span id="s955">And I didn’t see the woman anymore.</span> <span id="s956">So then it took eight days until we were liberated.</span> <span id="s957">And we were laying these eight days, with no food completely, because the Germans were running away.</span> <span id="s958">We seen them run, but we couldn’t go out because we were surrounded by electric wiring, so we couldn’t run out.</span> <span id="s959">So they ran away; nobody cared about us.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q:How long between the time the Germans left the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A:Eight days it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q:From the time the Germans left until the Americans...</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A:No, no, no.</span> <span id="s964">Eight days it took until they ran away.</span> <span id="s965">I guess it was eight days.</span> <span id="s966">And we seen them throw the ammunition away, and running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q:Was there any food available to you during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A:No.</span> <span id="s969">We were all so sick, we all had the diarrhea.</span> <span id="s970">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s971">And then we seen a white flag across the street.</span> <span id="s972">But we couldn’t open the, because it was electrified.</span> <span id="s973">So, after a short while, a jeep came in with five American soldiers.</span> <span id="s974">While they walked in, they didn’t go any farther.</span> <span id="s975">They fell to the wall and started to cry, that’s what kind of picture they seen.</span> <span id="s976">And who could went out.</span> <span id="s977">So the Germans around gave bread and pig fat.</span> <span id="s978">I was with a friend of mine, her name was Salla [?]</span> <span id="s979">.</span> <span id="s980">I said, “Salla [?]</span> <span id="s981">, don’t eat it.</span> <span id="s982">Your inside is empty.</span> <span id="s983">Listen to me!”</span> <span id="s984">But she didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s985">A couple days after, her behind was this big.</span> <span id="s986">I took her into that hospital, Salla [?]</span> <span id="s987">, on my hands.</span> <span id="s988">All of a sudden I hear a lady, “Lady, lady, come over, come over!”</span> <span id="s989">I go there.</span> <span id="s990">This lady is laying with a beautiful little girl.</span> <span id="s991">The one that gave birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q:The one that had given birth the week before?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A:Yes, she was laying there with a beautiful little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q:She had another?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A:No, this girl that she gave birth.</span> <span id="s996">They took her to that hospital.</span> <span id="s997">And when I brought the friend of mine in...</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q:Oh, you saw the woman...</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A:She called me, she said, “Lady, lady, come here, come here!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A:I said, “God, if you want, you can perform miracles.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q:Had she been with her baby all that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A:Yes, it was after the Liberation already, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q:When she delivered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A:She delivered, and it wasn’t liberated yet, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q:Was she able to be with her baby before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A:She must have been, because they took her to that hospital, and we never seen her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q:The Gypsies took her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A:Yes, they took her to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A:But I didn’t see her until I took my friend over there, and she said, “Lady, lady, come, I want to show you my naches, my pleasure!”</span> <span id="s1012">It was a beautiful little girl with the black hair.</span> <span id="s1013">Beautiful little girl.</span> <span id="s1014">I guess she is alive, I am pretty sure.</span> <span id="s1015">And that’s when we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q:And your friend did get sick from eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A:She did, and she didn’t make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q:She died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q:From eating the fat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1022">Sure.</span> <span id="s1023">She had dysentery.</span> <span id="s1024">Many had.</span> <span id="s1025">After the Liberation, they died.</span> <span id="s1026">What else do you want me to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q:Your friend, then, died there in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1029">Many, many died from the dysentery after the Liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q:And you feel that she died from the dysentery, from eating the food that was too rich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A:Yes, because the American soldiers brought...cereal, but it had conserved meat with fat, and whoever ate it, got the dysentery, and many of them died like flies.</span> <span id="s1032">They couldn’t [unclear], and they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q:What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A:I went into the hospital, and I figured to myself, as long as I will be able to, I’ll help the people.</span> <span id="s1035">Well, big cans of drums were standing with what people made, what is it, BM, and it was running over.</span> <span id="s1036">There was no medication, hardly a thermometer.</span> <span id="s1037">And a farmer, an old farmer, a German, came and brought milk, and instead, he took the food that the Americans gave us, for their pigs.</span> <span id="s1038">So after three days I seen that I wouldn’t be able to make it.</span> <span id="s1039">It was an old, old German, and I said to him, “Why don’t you take me to your house, I’ll help you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q:Let me back up for a minute.</span> <span id="s1041">This man took the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A:The American food, and instead of this, he brought milk for the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q:He exchanged it for the milk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q:So what were you eating then, the milk and the bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A:Yes, I was very careful.</span> <span id="s1047">I was very careful in eating.</span> <span id="s1048">I did not have dysentery, but I thought, seen that I’m going to fall if I did not take care of myself.</span> <span id="s1049">So the man told us that he has a three-year-old girl.</span> <span id="s1050">He married an old maid, and they had a young child, so I said, “Look, why don’t you take me to your farm, and I will take care of the girl, or whatever you need to do.”</span> <span id="s1051">So I was there maybe for eight days.</span> <span id="s1052">And I drank water, and potatoes, lean things, and I came a little bit, and I still kept in contact with the girls in the camp.</span> <span id="s1053">And then one day when I came to the camp to visit, they told me that a transport is going to Poland.</span> <span id="s1054">So I said, “I’m going also,” although I knew that there was little chance, but I figured maybe through a miracle I’ll be able to find somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q:This was when, May?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A:May of 1945.</span> <span id="s1057">So I registered for the transport back, and the lady gave me bread and cheese and hard-boiled eggs, and I don’t remember what else, and with that transport we went home back to Poland, and we came to Lodz and to the city where we were, and I had a bad experience there when I came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q:What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A:The city gave me a little room with broken windows, and I didn’t have anything whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q:This was your native town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1062">I went back, I went to the lady that was in the slaughterhouse where my father worked.</span> <span id="s1063">My father was a shochet [ritual slaughterer].</span> <span id="s1064">And they were the ones that took care, cleaned the slaughterhouse all the years, and we were raised practically there, because we always used to go there and play in the field and in the garden, in order to get a ride back home.</span> <span id="s1065">We walked there, you know, like children.</span> <span id="s1066">So I went there, and I said to her, “Give me something, whatever you can,” because if you didn’t work, because the Russians were there, you didn’t have that paper that they should give you a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1067">And she didn’t give me anything.</span> <span id="s1068">And I went back and I cried; I was so disappointed.</span> <span id="s1069">And I visited a girlfriend from my school years, and she had her house and everything, and I asked her for a photograph.</span> <span id="s1070">I said, “Give me, Yanka, you have so many, give me one, I would like to have something, too.”</span> <span id="s1071">So she said, “No, you don’t need it, I need it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q:What, a photograph...</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A:From the school days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q:This was a non-Jewish friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A:Yes, a non-Jewish friend, and she did not give me.</span> <span id="s1076">When I came in, she was eating dumplings and milk, and didn’t even offer me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q:Did she want to talk to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A:Yes, she did talk.</span> <span id="s1079">And I said, “Give me a pillow,” and she said, “My brother is somewhere in a camp.</span> <span id="s1080">He’s gonna be coming home, and I need the pillow.”</span> <span id="s1081">So I went home and I was plenty disappointed.</span> <span id="s1082">And then somebody told me that in a certain city, there is a sister of mine, Binderovich [?]</span> <span id="s1083">was her name, in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1084">So I borrowed a pocketbook from a friend of mine, and the pocketbook had outside pockets, and I had an American passport, like a temporary passport.</span> <span id="s1085">When I was liberated, they gave us a little paper, and I also had money and a ticket, a train ticket.</span> <span id="s1086">The money I received from certain American people.</span> <span id="s1087">Our Federation sent somebody to Poland with money, and they divided the money between the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q:From Federation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1090">They had the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q:There was a Jewish community group already established in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A:Not necessarily, but single people came, and in our city, the man that came was a representative from our city.</span> <span id="s1093">And he gave everybody some money, and I had this in a top pocket, and while I was going to that little city, it was night, and I was sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, and when I awoke, my pocket was empty.</span> <span id="s1094">I didn’t have the money, I didn’t have the ticket, and it was the practice in Europe that the ticket they give you when you go out.</span> <span id="s1095">So I waited until everybody was out already, and I said to that man, “Listen, look at me, judge whether I lie or not.</span> <span id="s1096">I had the ticket; it was stolen.</span> <span id="s1097">Believe me or not.”</span> <span id="s1098">He said, “Yes, I believe you.”</span> <span id="s1099">I went out, this was Gdansk, where all those things are now with Lech Walesa, that city.</span> <span id="s1100">It was bombed.</span> <span id="s1101">It was in a terrible condition.</span> <span id="s1102">I came out, and I go to a policeman, and I said, “Could you tell me where there is a Jew?”</span> <span id="s1103">He said, he showed me some rooms, but there was no Jew, and somebody else told me, and I went to that place, and it was not my sister.</span> <span id="s1104">It was the same name, but it was not my sister.</span> <span id="s1105">And I was very hungry.</span> <span id="s1106">I passed a market, and I smelled bread, and I nearly fainted.</span> <span id="s1107">So, all of a sudden I seen a man passing this way and that way, and another way, and I said, is he Jewish or not Jewish?</span> <span id="s1108">Should I approach him?</span> <span id="s1109">I thought, what am I going to do here?</span> <span id="s1110">Then he passed back, and I went to him and said: “Sir, are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1111">He said, “What’s the problem?”</span> <span id="s1112">I said, “The problem is that I came here, and I haven’t got money to go back.</span> <span id="s1113">I don’t have anything to...” He said, “Don’t make such tragedy out of it.</span> <span id="s1114">Come between Jews and rest.</span> <span id="s1115">We’ll give you money and you’ll go back.”</span> <span id="s1116">And sure enough, this was the man I married.</span> <span id="s1117">And I went back; I was there.</span> <span id="s1118">He had a little business with a partner there already...</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q:This was in Gdansk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A:In Gdansk.</span> <span id="s1121">And I was through the night there, and I ate, and then he took me.</span> <span id="s1122">I told him where I am, and the following day, two days after he was there, and through that something developed and we married.</span> <span id="s1123">And this is my husband of 34 years.</span> <span id="s1124">I had a terrible tragedy.</span> <span id="s1125">I lost a young son, 24 years old, a beautiful son.</span> <span id="s1126">Life in America was not easy for me.</span> <span id="s1127">I worked very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q:You lost your son through an accident, you said?</span> <span id="s1129">A hit and run accident?</span> <span id="s1130">This was recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A:Six years ago.</span> <span id="s1132">And this gave me the last push.</span> <span id="s1133">That was the last one that I..</span> <span id="s1134">.</span> <span id="s1135">I never recovered.</span> <span id="s1136">I recovered from all of them, but this one, I could never recover.</span> <span id="s1137">I have a daughter, 32 years old, very beautiful daughter.</span> <span id="s1138">She is married, and she adopted a little boy from South America.</span> <span id="s1139">She cannot have children.</span> <span id="s1140">Two years ago she adopted a little boy, and named him after my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q:How old is your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A:32 years old.</span> <span id="s1143">This is my grandson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q:Oh, he’s beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A:Yes, he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q:And chubby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A:He is a sweet little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q:You said that you met your husband.</span> <span id="s1149">Can we go back for a minute?</span> <span id="s1150">Did you marry then in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q:And you lived where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A:No, not long.</span> <span id="s1154">I lived...</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Tape 2 of 2, side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q:This is tape 2, side 2, of an interview with Mrs. Rose Fine.</span> <span id="s1157">You lived in Danzig2 after you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A:Right.</span> <span id="s1159">And then the trend started to go anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1160">We heard what happened here and there; we heard that people were harassed by the Poles, and that we are not welcome.</span> <span id="s1161">And then I took my husband and I wanted to show him my home town, and the house, apartment, where we lived, our janitor moved in.</span> <span id="s1162">And there was a little lock and chain on the door....</span> <span id="s1163">We stood there.</span> <span id="s1164">So I said to my husband, “Go knock, and I’ll show you where I was living.”</span> <span id="s1165">And she opened the door, and through the chain I said, “Mrs. Jelak, I want to show my husband where,” and she wouldn’t let me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q:This had been your janitor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1168">So, there was one door open to the dining room, and there stood a little bed, a white bed, with chrome, beautiful, and I said, “See this bed was where the girl slept,” and I was very disappointed, very disappointed.</span> <span id="s1169">And some of them mentioned, said, “How come so many of you are still alive?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q:Had this janitor been friendly to you when you lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A:Yes, but he made a living from us, he had to be.</span> <span id="s1172">But once he was free, he started to show his pig face, you know.</span> <span id="s1173">And one time we went to Lodz, and we smuggled the border to Germany, to the American side, and from there we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q:Did you have trouble getting to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A:No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1176">It was through the Joint.</span> <span id="s1177">I’ll be very thankful until the day I die; I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s1178">We came into a home, was a poor home.</span> <span id="s1179">The country for us was poor, because we had to struggle from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q:You’re talking about when you came here now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q:When did you emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A:In 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q:So you’re talking about four years of moving...</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A:No, we were in Germany for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q:You were in Germany for four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A:Three years or four years.</span> <span id="s1188">We smuggled across the border, and until we came to the United States, it took us until 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q:And where did you live in Germany?</span> <span id="s1190">In the American...</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A:On the American side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q:In Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q:And what was your experience like, living in Germany during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A:They are big anti-Semites; there is no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s1196">They are all Jew haters; there is no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s1197">The one hid it; one didn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s1198">There is no rule without an exception.</span> <span id="s1199">There might be between a million, one or two that are different, but the majority hate a Jew.</span> <span id="s1200">There is no two doubts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q:Were you members of the new congregation in Munich, the new synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1203">Sure, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s1204">We had contact with Jews,

right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q:Was there a support group of Jews in Munich during those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A:Yes, very nice.</span> <span id="s1213">We had to cling to each other because we were the only ones.</span> <span id="s1214">What we felt, the air was poisoned.</span> <span id="s1215">It wasn’t our country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q:Were you able to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A:I didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1218">I went to ORT3 school.</span> <span id="s1219">I learned to sew.</span> <span id="s1220">That’s how I know how to sew.</span> <span id="s1221">Then I had a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q:Was she born there?</span> <span id="s1223">Your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A:I had another tragedy, I don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1225">I lost another child, one and one-half years old.</span> <span id="s1226">It was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q:In Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A:I told you it’s a long story.</span> <span id="s1229">It was a life full of a lot of pain, a lot of heartache.</span> <span id="s1230">[unclear] had a brain tumor and died.</span> <span id="s1231">Yeah, it’s not easy.</span> <span id="s1232">I hope it’s enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q:So you came here in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q:And your husband was able to find work when you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A:Yeah, it was tough.</span> <span id="s1237">He worked for 45 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s1238">It was tough.</span> <span id="s1239">I had to go to work when my child was two years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q:Did you come to Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q:Because you had known people here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A:No, my permit was for Philadelphia.</span></p>

id="s1246">Q:Had she been with you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A:No, she left the ghetto two days before I did, and we lost track.</span> <span id="s1248">She was with one of my sisters, and my sister died four weeks after the Liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q:Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the years in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A:What can I tell you, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1251">There is much more that you can go into details and talk and talk, and you can sit days and nights; and there is no end to it, if you want to go detail by detail.</span> <span id="s1252">It was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s1253">It was something that was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1254">The only thing I can tell you is that I don’t hear my voice.</span> <span id="s1255">That’s not me.</span> <span id="s1256">Isn’t it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A:To you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A:To my ears, it is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q:Thank you very much, Mrs. Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A:My pleasure, my pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q:This is some additional information, a story that has happened to Mrs. Fine recently.</span> <span id="s1264">Could you tell us about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s1266">In my home city, a gentleman, a gentile man, hid in the attic a Torah, a Sefer Torah [Torah scroll], and a Mr. Reinsky, from Georgia, a friend from my city, went home to visit our hometown, and the gentleman was willing to give him back.</span> <span id="s1267">It took a nice couple of months before the city, whoever it was, would allow him to take it back.</span> <span id="s1268">The government allowed him to take it, and he went back and brought it over, and there was a big, big celebration in Georgia, in Atlanta, Georgia, where they welcomed the Torah.</span> <span id="s1269">And there were beautiful speeches by the Rabbi, by the cantor, and I was also one that made a speech.</span> <span id="s1270">I was very proud, because it connected me with the beautiful memories of my hometown where I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q:Is there any knowledge of how the Torah got into this man’s keeping?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A:I don’t know, but I could ask him.</span> <span id="s1273">As a matter of fact, we are going to have a reunion in June in the Concord Hotel, and while I’m there I’ll ask him.</span> <span id="s1274">And I don’t mind telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q:And was this news known in the United States that this man had the Torah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1277">Between our people it was.</span> <span id="s1278">I don’t know whether it was among other people.</span> <span id="s1279">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1280">But it was a beautiful Sefer Torah.</span> <span id="s1281">As a matter of fact, he gave me a silver becher [cup], with the name [unclear] engraved.</span> <span id="s1282">And I would like any American to see how beautiful things European had, if you think that we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1283">Beautiful, beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q:This was a European piece?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A:Right.</span> <span id="s1286">There was one man, a Jew, one man in the city, still living in the city, an old man, so he gave him a couple of those bechers, and he gave me one.</span> <span id="s1287">Beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q:And where was it from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A:From [unclear] from my city, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q:So you have one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A:Right, I have a little one.</span> <span id="s1292">There is a heart engraved, beautiful.</span> <span id="s1293">He gave it to me because I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q:Do you have any idea...</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A:I also have a tape from my speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q:Good!</span> <span id="s1297">Do you have any idea how many people from your town survived the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A:Now many.</span> <span id="s1299">Maybe 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q:Out of how, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A:Oh my gosh, maybe 5,000, 6,000.</span> <span id="s1302">Not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q:This was a happy day for those of you who were lucky enough to be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1305">I have mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s1306">There is nobody to sigh with you, nobody to cry with you.</span> <span id="s1307">A life by itself is not a happy life.</span> <span id="s1308">So you marry and have your child, and there is no bubby [grandmother], no zayde [grandfather], no aunt, no uncle, only a friend.</span> <span id="s1309">I am not sad, but of course, I thank God, but if you want to analyze it, it’s not right.</span> <span id="s1310">Not here, not there.</span> <span id="s1311">You’re alone.</span> <span id="s1312">If you’re from 10 children in a family, who had 21 grandchildren, and there is only one alive, it’s hard; and then life is cruel to you, you know.</span> <span id="s1313">I should know.</span> <span id="s1314">Nobody has it peaches and cherries, and I had knocks that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q:It didn’t stop for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A:No, it didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q:It was good to talk to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A:Likewise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q:Thank you.</span></p> <p><span
