birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Elzbieta Lusthaus.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And the date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: May 15, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Krakow, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Would you talk about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s23">My parents were living in Iwonicz, which is a spa in the mountains.</span> <span id="s24">My father was a physician, and he and my mother had been married for two years when I was born.</span> <span id="s25">They were very happy together, they were looking forward to my birth, and things were pretty idyllic.</span> <span id="s26">In 1939, the war broke out in Poland.</span> <span id="s27">The Germans invaded Poland, and my father, being a physician, had to join the Polish Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Before he left for wherever he was going to be sent, he went to say goodbye to his parents, who were living in Lwow.</span> <span id="s29">At that time Poland was partitioned, and Lwow was in the Russian sector, and where we were living was in the German sector.</span> <span id="s30">And when he tried to get back to us, he was taken as a prisoner of war to Siberia.</span> <span id="s31">When he didn't come back, my mother became very worried.</span> <span id="s32">But she was a very strong and resourceful woman, and so what she did was she sold everything she could in the little town, because I think we were probably one of the few Jewish families; there may have been one or two others.</span> <span id="s33">And she went to Tarnow, and Tarnow was where her mother was living.</span> <span id="s34">And so where does a young woman who doesn't have a husband with a small child, go?</span> <span id="s35">Back to her own mother, and we lived in Tarnow.</span> <span id="s36">And when I did the show interview, I didn't know that we were in a ghetto, but I found some papers of my mother's which said that we were in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s37">Part of the time we lived in Tarnow with my grandmother, and then we were taken to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s38">And my mother was allowed to go out and work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s39">My mother was a pharmacist, but I don't know if that's what she was working as.</span> <span id="s40">I remember when they took my grandmother.</span> <span id="s41">I was probably about three years old, I remember when she went.</span> <span id="s42">And from my mother's papers I learned that she was concerned that they were going to do another transport with young children.</span> <span id="s43">And so because she was able to go out, she had connections, and she found someone who sold her Christian papers, so that we went to a place called Milanowek Potashawol (phonetic).</span> <span id="s44">I think it was probably around 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Now, this was in '43, and so you would have been five years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s47">It may have been '42.</span> <span id="s48">I have pictures of myself in Tarnow in '42, so I would assume it was either '42 or '43 that we went to Milanowek.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And you had different names on the papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s51">My name was Barbara Stachura and my mother was Maria Stachura, and we lived with a lady by the name of Mrs. Gesia, which is a diminutive of Genowefa Bandyrowa, and her two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And how did you find them or how did they find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: They were friends of friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s54">Somehow they had no connection to us but they were willing to hide us, and so we lived with them until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s55">And at times I lived upstairs with my mother, at times I lived in the basement.</span> <span id="s56">I was usually drugged when I was put in the basement because it was a dangerous time and my mother had access, I guess, to medication.</span> <span id="s57">At times I was allowed to play outside, and my best friend at that time was Wisia, and Wisia was the younger daughter who was nine years older than I, so she was probably 14 or so, give or take, and she was my best friend, and I'm still in contact with Wisia.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Now, backing up, some of this story has been told to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s60">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What is the earliest thing that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I don't remember my father, obviously; he left when I was 16 months old.</span> <span id="s63">I certainly remember my mother.</span> <span id="s64">I remember my grandmother, and I remember the Germans taking her.</span> <span id="s65">That's a very, very vivid memory for me.</span> <span id="s66">I know there was a place that had stone seats, and my mother had always said to me if anything bad is happening, you go into this place and you hide under the seat.</span> <span id="s67">And when they took my grandmother, I went and I hid under the seat.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: This was in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, this was in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Okay, in the okay.</span> <span id="s71">Okay.</span> <span id="s72">So you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I remember that.</span> <span id="s74">And I was three, probably three or three and a half.</span> <span id="s75">And I don't remember going to Milanowek, but I remember living there.</span> <span id="s76">I remember the house, I remember the room that we had.</span> <span id="s77">We had a very, very large stove which had tiles on it, and that was the only place that you got warmth.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So you and your mother had a room for yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And did you spend all of your time in the room, or did you live with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: We lived with the family.</span> <span id="s82">The house was just partitioned into lots and lots of little rooms, and there were lots of people living there.</span> <span id="s83">People were coming and people were going.</span> <span id="s84">It was also the headquarters for the Polish Underground, and there were little eagles on the windows, and when it was safe, they flashed certain colors, and there was a cupboard with a false back.</span> <span id="s85">I mean, this was a very exciting place in which to be.</span> <span id="s86">But I thought I was Christian.</span> <span id="s87">I went to church; my mother never went to church.</span> <span id="s88">I never questioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Who did you go to church with?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I went to church with the Bandyrowa family, with my best friend Wisia and her mother and her older sister, and at times I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So that's something that you just always did, and it</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You didn't think anything of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No.</span> <span id="s95">I was getting ready for my first communion, I was preparing; I mean, this was it.</span> <span id="s96">And the Germans were there and everybody hated the Germans, and there were secrets, but in those days, unlike now, children didn't question.</span> <span id="s97">If the parents said this is what's going to happen, that was it.</span> <span id="s98">Sometimes my mother would go away for days at a time, and I never questioned.</span> <span id="s99">If I asked Wisia, she would say I think your mother's working in a different town, or the Germans are looking for people, and she was hiding, or whatever.</span> <span id="s100">And there were other people in the house that were hiding, so it was not anything alien in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: And what was your understanding of what the other people were doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: There was a war going on, there were bombs falling, people's houses were being destroyed, people's families were being killed.</span> <span id="s103">People shared.</span> <span id="s104">You know, if you had food, you shared it with other people; if they had food, they shared it with you.</span> <span id="s105">I remember being hungry.</span> <span id="s106">There wasn't always enough food, but we grew vegetables, and we had milk that was brought in, and we did the best we could.</span> <span id="s107">But everybody shared, and it was war, and there were bombs falling.</span> <span id="s108">There was very little meat, because all the meat went to the front for the soldiers, and the Germans were taking a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s109">And everybody hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s110">I mean, that was a common thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: And do you remember hating the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s113">And there were times when my mother would put me to bed and she would tie up my throat, and she would put carbolic acid around, because the Germans that was a smell that you used in hospitals, that was a smell that you used to disinfect.</span> <span id="s114">And they would come and she would say krank, meaning sick, and she said we'll pretend that you're sick.</span> <span id="s115">Period.</span> <span id="s116">And if they asked me questions about my father, I knew my father was in Siberia, and that was a positive thing, because obviously if he were in Siberia, he was proGerman, and we were, you know, just a good Christian family whose father had been taken away by the Russians.</span> <span id="s117">Then after the war ended, and the Russians came in to liberate us, then my mother said now we can't tell the Russians that Daddy is in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: So you were about seven then?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: The war ended in '45.</span> <span id="s120">I guess, yeah, probably around seven.</span> <span id="s121">So now we're going to tell them that he's in a concentration camp or a labor camp, and that was okay with me.</span> <span id="s122">I mean, I was a very good child and I did what my mother told me.</span> <span id="s123">There was not a question of saying why or, you know, there was a war and people were getting killed, and I didn't want to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Do you remember being afraid that you would be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Oh, yes, because the bombs were falling, and for years afterwards when I saw planes, I would expect bombs to come.</span> <span id="s126">Even when I was you know, after we had left Poland, I was very, very scared of bombs and the noise and planes going over, because that's what planes did in Poland during the war, they dropped bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You said that you spent some time in the basement.</span> <span id="s128">Was that when the bombs were falling that you went to the basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Sometimes, also sometimes when they were looking for Jews, and my mother looked very Jewish.</span> <span id="s130">I guess I didn't, although when I talked to Wisia when I did the show interview, she told me that one of the things she was supposed to do was to keep me dirty, and so when I played outside with all the children, I was always covered with mud because I wasn't blond, and everybody else was blond.</span> <span id="s131">And that was fun, too.</span> <span id="s132">I mean, imagine being a little kid and your big sister puts mud on you and your mother doesn't say anything about it, everybody thinks it's cool.</span> <span id="s133">So that was kind of a fun fun part.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So Wisia was nine years older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And she was your best friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: She was my best friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: She looked out for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: She looked out for me, exactly.</span> <span id="s140">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Were there other children in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Some.</span> <span id="s143">Actually, the caretaker who lived in a little hut near the house, who was responsible for taking care of this house, had I think ten or eleven children.</span> <span id="s144">There were seemed like zillions of children, and we all played together.</span> <span id="s145">We tried to lead as normal lives as possible.</span> <span id="s146">Sometimes we went to school, sometimes we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: What made the difference whether you went to school or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Depending upon what the situation was in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s149">If the Germans were coming, then school was not in session.</span> <span id="s150">If we needed to hide, we hid.</span> <span id="s151">But nobody questioned, everybody hid, everybody did what they were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And what kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I went to Catholic school with the Sisters of St. Ursula, the Grey Ursulines, and I finished I don't think I even finished second grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And did that seem natural to you, to be going to a Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, I was Catholic.</span> <span id="s156">I was Catholic.</span> <span id="s157">Of course.</span> <span id="s158">I went to church, and I prayed, and I prayed that my father would come home, and I prayed he would be there when I went to do my first communion.</span> <span id="s159">And I know now that if anything had happened to my mother, that this family would have kept me.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: And you would have stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And I would have stayed, and I would have been a good Catholic girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: What else do you remember about that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Flowers on the trees, fruit on the trees, you know, that we ate.</span> <span id="s164">When the Russians came in to liberate us in '45, they came and they took over the house, and they wouldn't allow anybody out.</span> <span id="s165">And we had a woman who delivered milk, and she had to go and deliver milk but they wouldn't let her leave, and I remember she tied I thought they were sheets but it turned out it was a rope, and she went down the rope, through the bathroom window, and everybody thought that was a really interesting kind of a place.</span> <span id="s166">And I remember when the Germans were leaving as the Russians were coming, and everybody was cheering because they were leaving.</span> <span id="s167">And there had been some German children in the neighborhood that were pretty nasty, and they were fleeing with their families, and that was kind of nice, too, because they were doing what we had been doing, and now we were sort of on top and they weren't.</span> <span id="s168">And the Russians were nice, and they were giving us food and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: The Russians were nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Very nice, extremely nice.</span> <span id="s171">They came and they liberated liberated us, got rid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s172">And then we left shortly after that.</span> <span id="s173">Now</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: So there was no mistreatment from the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Oh, no, not at that point.</span> <span id="s176">I mean, we left within a couple of months of when the war ended.</span> <span id="s177">My mother and I were taken by Wisia's father was apparently in prison, the Germans had imprisoned him, and when the Russians came, he was released.</span> <span id="s178">And so he drove us to the Krakow area, and my mother put me in a convent and she went looking for family, and of course she found no one.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: She put you in a convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: What were the circumstances in the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: She was I was still one of I was one of the young children, and I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s183">And the school was in a convent, and this was a different set of nuns, different order of nuns.</span> <span id="s184">I don't know how you would translate that into English.</span> <span id="s185">They were called Prezentki, and maybe I can find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Now, were you still being considered a Catholic child?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No.</span> <span id="s188">At that point, when I when the war ended and the Russians came, my mother told me we're going to tell the Russians that Daddy's in a German camp, and I want you to know that we're not Catholic, that you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s189">And I was horrified, because I you know, I was into the dogma, and into the teachings of the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s190">And I went to talk to my priest, and my and I said I'm not Catholic, Father, I'm Jewish, will I burn in hell?</span> <span id="s191">And he said yes, go away.</span> <span id="s192">And that was a pretty horrifying kind of a thing, that was pretty awful to be told that, because I had been through no fault of my own, all of a sudden I had changed.</span> <span id="s193">But when we when we left to go to the Krakow area and my mother said I'm going to put you into school so you're safe, she's said you're still going to have to pretend that you're Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: You were horrified when the priest said</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: you're going to burn in hell?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Did you talk to your mother about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s200">She said well, that's what they think, but that's not what we think.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And then how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I was confused because I hadn't really met any Jews.</span> <span id="s203">I didn't know what Jews were like.</span> <span id="s204">But before we left Milanowek to go to the Krakow area again, my mother said we're going to go see if we can find any of our Jewish relatives, and then you can see how nice Jews are.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: When your mother said you're a Jew, what did you think that meant, being a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: It meant that I was the awful person.</span> <span id="s207">You have to remember this is in the early '40s, where the Polish Catholics thought that the Jews had crucified Christ and they were awful people and, you know, there was a lot of antisemitism in Poland.</span> <span id="s208">You know, I can speaking as an adult, I didn't know that then, but they were the bad people.</span> <span id="s209">They were the people that the Germans were taking away because they were so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So you had picked up that</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Oh, oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: from other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Oh, sure, oh, sure.</span> <span id="s214">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And then you were told you were one now?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Right.</span> <span id="s217">It's an awful feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: So when you got back to Krakow, your mother said you had to be in the convent for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: And how did that feel to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Well, my mother was looking for relatives.</span> <span id="s222">I was hoping she'd come back with a whole lot of relatives, and we'd all live together happily every after.</span> <span id="s223">But she never found any relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Did she find what had happened to the relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: After the war there was a book published of survivors, and nobody that she knew was in the book, not even my father.</span> <span id="s226">So she assumed he was dead and she had to make a life for herself, but she wasn't going to stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s227">There was no point to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">So she got us smuggled out by Russian guards in crates of china.</span> <span id="s229">Again, I was medicated, and I was put china was put in there, then I was put in there, and then straw on top, or maybe the other way around, and we went over the border to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Now, how did she arrange the smuggling with the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s232">I don't know.</span> <span id="s233">I assumed she paid them.</span> <span id="s234">I assume she had money saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: But she never told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I never asked.</span> <span id="s237">You know, it was something you didn't talk about.</span> <span id="s238">I don't think I ever talked to my mother about what had happened until maybe when we got to the United States, and she was always very reluctant to talk.</span> <span id="s239">It was not a pretty part of her past that she wanted to discuss.</span> <span id="s240">So I never really knew.</span> <span id="s241">But we went to Czechoslovakia, we lived in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Now, before that, did you know that you were going to be drugged and put into a crate?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: No, but I'd been drugged before, and my mother said you're going to take this medication, you're going to fall asleep, and when you wake up, we'll be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: And is that what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: So you did remain asleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: The entire time you were in the crate?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Where do you think she got the medication?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: She was a pharmacist.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: My mother was a pharmacist by profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So she had access?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And knew something about dosages?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And so she was in a crate, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: She was in crate, I was in a crate, and there were apparently other people in crates, because when I woke up, we were all standing and they were all there were several of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So the journey was from Krakow to</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Where in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s264">But it was very close to the Austrian border, because then we went to Austria, and we wound up at a place called</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: So before that, so you woke up and you were out of the crate</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: when you woke up, and do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s269">Yeah, I remember.</span> <span id="s270">We were in a field, and we ate potatoes.</span> <span id="s271">And then we started walking, and part of the time my mother carried me and part of the time I walked.</span> <span id="s272">And we wound up</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: You were with your mother and some other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Was there a guide with you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s277">You have to remember, I was seven years old.</span> <span id="s278">My mother said we're walking, we walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And getting over being drugged?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: I had been drugged before.</span> <span id="s281">It was only you were woozy for a while and you were kind of confused, but she was there, and she was always there, so whatever she wanted was okay with me.</span> <span id="s282">And then we went to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: So you walked from a field in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Right.</span> <span id="s285">To Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: You walked all the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: We may not have walked all the way to Vienna.</span> <span id="s288">I'd have to look on a map, I guess, to see where, but somehow we wound up in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And you did a lot of walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: We did a lot of walking, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: And in Vienna they had a place called the Rothschild Hospital, which was sort of a transition point for people.</span> <span id="s293">I remember we slept in a big room with all girls and all women, and the men and the boys slept in another room, and we got meals and we got clean clothes, and we were sprayed with DDT in case we had lice or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Do you know who sponsored this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: I think UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: And we were there for maybe a couple of months, I would think, until something was arranged for us.</span> <span id="s298">My mother was looking for relatives and couldn't find anybody.</span> <span id="s299">But thinking that my father was dead, because he hadn't been in the book, either, she decided that we would go to Israel.</span> <span id="s300">And so we joined a camp for children in Germany, orphaned children going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s302">You're in Vienna, and your mother decided to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s303">So how did you</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: She I would assume that UNRRA helped her go, you know.</span> <span id="s305">This was just a transition point.</span> <span id="s306">People didn't stay there for an extended period of time in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Do you remember going from Vienna to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes, and we went in a truck; I'm pretty sure we went in a truck.</span> <span id="s309">And we went to a camp for Jewish orphans, and there were hundreds of Jewish orphans, and there were grownups who were taking care of them.</span> <span id="s310">There were teachers and there were doctors, and there were people who did things.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So your mother was in the camp with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s313">She got a job as a pharmacist, and we were going to go to Israel where she hoped maybe she had relatives there.</span> <span id="s314">And we were in this camp probably for about from the point we left Poland until we went to Italy was six months, about, or maybe maybe less, even.</span> <span id="s315">But we were in this camp, and they were getting ready to get a ship to take us to Israel, and a medical commission came through the camp to check the camp to make sure that all conditions were good.</span> <span id="s316">And my mother recognized one of the doctors in the commission, and, you know, they hugged each other, and he said oh, my goodness, you're alive.</span> <span id="s317">And she said this is my daughter.</span> <span id="s318">We both survived, and my husband didn't.</span> <span id="s319">And he said oh, no, he's alive; he's in Italy.</span> <span id="s320">So he sent a telegram to Italy, and the next day an ambulance came, because if you're a doctor, that's your mode of transportation.</span> <span id="s321">And I met my father.</span> <span id="s322">I was eight years old, and I met my father for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s324">You were in the camp in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: And your father was in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And so he contacted your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And then you and your mother went to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And how did you get from the camp in Germany to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: By ambulance.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Oh, you went the whole trip from Germany to Italy</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: by this ambulance?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: So he got the ambulance?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: For you</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: and your mother to travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Right.</span> <span id="s344">And he had he had been in Siberia, and he said the only reason he survived was because he was a doctor and they needed him to take care of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s345">And so he would get better rations and better clothing, even though he lost several toes, you know, to frostbite.</span> <span id="s346">And then there was an amnesty in Poland in Siberia, and the nonpolitical prisoners were allowed to join the Polish Army fighting with General Anders with the Allies, and he joined the Army.</span> <span id="s347">They went to Egypt and they fought against Rommel, and then they went to Italy and they fought at Monte Cassino.</span> <span id="s348">And then, you know, he obviously got permission for us to come.</span> <span id="s349">And then we were in Italy for six months, and then the Army went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: You were in Italy for six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And your father was in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: In Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Where were you and your mother living?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: With him.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: He had a house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: He had a hut or whatever those things were in Italy.</span> <span id="s360">Maybe he had an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: So you just moved in with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s365">In fact, I had pictures of that.</span> <span id="s366">You know, we'd go swimming to the beach, we toured</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: We, you and your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh, yes, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s369">You know, the war was over by that time, and the Army still hadn't been demobilized but the war was over, so this was a miracle that we had survived, it was a miracle that he had survived.</span> <span id="s370">So I guess there were other people there with families.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And did he also have to work during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Oh, yes, I mean, he was still</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: He was working?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: He was still working, but he got time off.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So you would spend part of the day with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Well, I would spend some you know, there was a school I went to.</span> <span id="s377">I was learning Italian, I was playing with the Italian children.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: What was the school that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: It was an Army school for children.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Of the people that were still in the Army.</span> <span id="s382">And then the Army went to England, and my father continued to work as a doctor, and everybody had families.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: So your father went to England, and you and your mother went also?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: With him, yes.</span> <span id="s385">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: And where did you live in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: In England we lived in a place called Bedlington no excuse me, Morpeth.</span> <span id="s388">No, maybe it was a little place between Bedlington and Morpeth.</span> <span id="s389">It was called Hartford Bridge, and there were all the people that were there with the Polish Army was there, and there I went to English school.</span> <span id="s390">And I went to</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: With English children?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: With English children.</span> <span id="s393">And then I passed an exam, and I went to grammar school.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Now, did you know English when you went to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No.</span> <span id="s396">No.</span> <span id="s397">But I learned it very, very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: But you just started right off in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s400">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And learned English as you went along?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: And you were then about eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: It was I can tell you, it was December of 1946 that we arrived in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: So you were about eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I was eight.</span> <span id="s407">And what they did was they assigned an English girl to me in the class, and she and I sat together, we had double desks, and she would point at things, and she was sort of my mentor.</span> <span id="s408">And I would point to this and she would say table, chair, and that's how we learned.</span> <span id="s409">There was no bilingual education.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Were there other refugee children in this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s412">Oh, yes, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s413">Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And who were your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: The refugee children, and also some of the English children that I went to school with.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: And at this point where was your confusion about being Catholic or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Well, in the German in the camp in Germany I had started learning about Judaism.</span> <span id="s418">I had trouble with the writing, but I learned the concepts.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: With the Hebrew writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: With the Hebrew, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Now, where did you learn about this and learn the writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: In Germany, in the camp for Jewish orphans where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: There was a school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Or this was informal teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s427">It was very formal it was a very formal camp.</span> <span id="s428">These were children that had lost their parents, they needed structure, so we had school, we had play time, we went on trips.</span> <span id="s429">I saw my first elephant in a zoo there, I rode a horse.</span> <span id="s430">I mean, we were we were in heaven, we thought, considering what we had all gone through in terms of deprivation and having lost families and not being able to eat and being in hiding.</span> <span id="s431">They were really worse than I was; at least I had one parent.</span> <span id="s432">You know, many of them had none.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So in that camp you were learning some Hebrew, and you were with other Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: And how were you feeling about it at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, we were you know, they didn't have horns, you know.</span> <span id="s437">In Poland the concept was the Jews had horns.</span> <span id="s438">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s439">The adults were very nice.</span> <span id="s440">Maybe the things I had learned as a child were not exactly true, you know, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s441">But, you know, at the age of seven or eight you don't really have to make decisions; you can wait and see what happens when you grow up.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: So then when you got to England, you were in a school that was not a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: And how was that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: It was okay.</span> <span id="s446">I mean, that was the third religion, it was Church of England, and the principal said if we spoke to my parents and said if I didn't want to attend the services, it was okay.</span> <span id="s447">And my father said no, you know, I want her to be exposed to all religions, it's okay.</span> <span id="s448">So you know, they would have a prayer, and you didn't have to pray if you didn't want to, you could just stand and bow your head and say your own prayer or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: What had your parents' religious practices been before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: My father apparently came from an extremely orthodox family.</span> <span id="s451">My grandmother had shaved her head and she wore a wig.</span> <span id="s452">My mother came from a very observant family, but not to that extent.</span> <span id="s453">So but they both had strong traditions.</span> <span id="s454">And they continued, you know, when we had our own home, they continued.</span> <span id="s455">And Judaism is a religion that you can practice in any way you want, to any degree you want, so it's very permissive in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So you were going to school with the Church of England?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: And your parents were observant at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: To some extent.</span> <span id="s460">We didn't eat pork, you know, certain things that we didn't do.</span> <span id="s461">But when you're in the Army, you can't always do exactly as you want.</span> <span id="s462">We were still in the Army.</span> <span id="s463">And then the Army was demobilized, and then my parents had to make a decision as to what they were going to do.</span> <span id="s464">And my mother had discovered that her mother's sister, her greataunt, was living in the United States, and she was willing to bring us to the United States.</span> <span id="s465">So we came to the United States in 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: So you had to wait several years?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Was that for a quota that you had to wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Apparently.</span> <span id="s470">Then they passed some special law that allowed us to come to the United States as you know, we were stateless, and we were allowed in.</span> <span id="s471">And my greataunt and uncle guaranteed that they would take care of us and support us.</span> <span id="s472">And we were healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: So you had been in England for several years?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: In England?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: In one place, in one school?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No.</span> <span id="s481">I went to first I went to elementary school, and then in England when you get to a certain age, you sit an exam, and if you pass it, you go on to there are two tracks, there's a commercial track and then there's a college track, and if you pass the test, you go to a grammar school, it's what's called grammar school.</span> <span id="s482">And I was fortunate that I passed.</span> <span id="s483">And so I went to a school where I learned Latin and French and algebra and geometry.</span> <span id="s484">And then when I came to the United States, they said oh, you're 13, you're going to 8th grade, and it didn't matter that I'd had French and Latin and geometry and algebra.</span> <span id="s485">And I was bored, very bored.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So you were academically very ahead of American children?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: How did you feel about leaving your situation in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Well, this was the first time I'd really had a family.</span> <span id="s490">My parents had decided to do this.</span> <span id="s491">My mother was happy, my father was happy.</span> <span id="s492">They felt there were more opportunities in this country, so we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Were there any things that were hard for you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Friends.</span> <span id="s495">My friends, the people at school.</span> <span id="s496">Yeah.</span> <span id="s497">We liked England.</span> <span id="s498">I liked England very much.</span> <span id="s499">Even the weather was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: So you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, we came to Newark, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Is that where your</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: That's where my greataunt and uncle were living.</span> <span id="s504">First we lived with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Do you remember your arrival in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s507">Came on the Queen Mary.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And what did you think of the voyage?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: It was lovely.</span> <span id="s510">We had wonderful food and we had nice cabins.</span> <span id="s511">There was entertainment on the ship.</span> <span id="s512">I mean, I didn't come to Ellis Island in steerage, I came on the Queen Mary.</span> <span id="s513">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s514">And our aunt and uncle were there, and they took us to their house.</span> <span id="s515">They had a huge house.</span> <span id="s516">I had never seen a house that big.</span> <span id="s517">Now that I look back, it's probably smaller than the house I have now with my husband, but, you know, it was immense.</span> <span id="s518">There was food and there was everything.</span> <span id="s519">And it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: So you lived</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: We lived in Newark with them briefly, and then my father had to pass his medical boards, so he had to go back to school and, you know, kind of take a course to sort of review things.</span> <span id="s522">And then he passed his boards, and then because we weren't citizens, he couldn't practice in either New York or New Jersey, so he was offered a chance to work in Maryland.</span> <span id="s523">And so he came to Maryland a year ahead of us, because I was in my last year of high school and they didn't want to move me again, you know, I'd been moving around so much.</span> <span id="s524">And so in 1955, we moved to Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: How was high school for you as</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: It was simple.</span> <span id="s527">It was very simple.</span> <span id="s528">In fact, what I did, I went to two summer sessions and I repeated the stuff that I had taken in England, and at least I did it for six weeks instead of, you know, six months.</span> <span id="s529">So I graduated in three and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: How was it as far as making friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Well, I was a rarity, I had an English accent and I had, you know, a different life than they had had.</span> <span id="s532">They had lived in one place.</span> <span id="s533">They had had friends in one place, and, you know, I was sort of different, so I made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s534">It was kind of nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: And did you have refugee friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span> <span id="s537">No.</span> <span id="s538">No, we lived with my aunt and uncle, and then we had our own apartment.</span> <span id="s539">Then when my father was studying and then he had to pass the boards and he had to do an internship for a year, and my mother worked.</span> <span id="s540">My mother worked to support us, and I did the housework.</span> <span id="s541">So everybody had their own jobs.</span> <span id="s542">So I really didn't have that much time.</span> <span id="s543">I'm sure there were refugees in Newark, but I mean you didn't walk around and say are you a refugee.</span> <span id="s544">My mother had friends from where she worked.</span> <span id="s545">My mother worked in a bakery and my father was away for part of the time because he had an internship in Bayonne, New Jersey, which was nearby, and then we went to Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And your mother or your father, did they have any refugee or survivor friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: My mother found cousins that were here, and then she found her best friend, who was living in Brooklyn, someone with whom she had gone to school in kindergarten and elementary school, and they were overwhelmed that they had found each other.</span> <span id="s548">And this friend had a daughter exactly my age, one month younger, and we've been friends now since 1951, and we still maintain a friendship, which is kind of nice.</span> <span id="s549">Even when we don't see each other, we still have history together, you know, that we can pick up as we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Did you know her?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Before you came to the states?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No.</span> <span id="s554">No, she had been in hiding, also, and they came to the United States earlier, and her father had been killed, also had been killed, you know, in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So you moved to Maryland?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: With your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: To this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: We lived in Carroll County, and my father was a psychiatrist in a mental hospital.</span> <span id="s561">We had a house on the grounds.</span> <span id="s562">And unfortunately, he died in 1960.</span> <span id="s563">So</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: He was fairly young?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: He was 60 years old.</span> <span id="s566">My mother was 48 when he died.</span> <span id="s567">And so he died, and my mother decided to go to New York because the house where she lived came with the job.</span> <span id="s568">And so within six months she had to vacate the house.</span> <span id="s569">So she came to she went back to New Jersey to her friends at the bakery, and she got a job at the bakery again.</span> <span id="s570">And I was married two years later, so I stayed in Maryland with my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Now, when your father died, were you living with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s573">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: So you had to leave the house, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s576">Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: So in 1960, you would have been 22?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s579">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: We're missing a space here.</span> <span id="s581">You graduated from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Oh, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s583">Oh, and then I came to Maryland, and I went to college, I went to the University of Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: And then I graduated from Maryland in February of 1959, and I got a job working at the hospital.</span> <span id="s586">And then I went to graduate school for a year.</span> <span id="s587">I was training as a social worker, and then my father died.</span> <span id="s588">And the hospital had they gave me a stipend, which meant they paid me a full salary while I went to graduate school.</span> <span id="s589">I worked for three days a week and I went to school two days a week, to graduate school at University of Pennsylvania, and any holidays that I had from school, I had to work.</span> <span id="s590">And then when school was over in no, excuse me.</span> <span id="s591">Then when my father died, I owed the hospital a year of my life, you know, I had to pay back essentially by working, and so they I decided since I was getting married anyway, that I would drop out of graduate school and I would pay them back the year, because in case my husband got transferred somewhere, then I would want to go with him.</span> <span id="s592">So by then it was we were married in 1961, and we lived in Maryland, and my husband worked for the National Bureau of Standards, and I finished graduate school.</span> <span id="s593">And then I had a car accident where I broke my neck, so I was (The recording ended at this point.)</span></p> <p><span id="s594">(New recording began.)</span></p> <p><span id="s595">MS. GARRETT: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer Collection interview with Elizabeth Strassburger.</span> <span id="s596">Tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: When the tape was cut off, you were talking about moving to Syracuse with your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: And your two children were born there?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Right.</span> <span id="s601">But prior to moving to Syracuse, I did eventually go back to graduate school, and I did get a master's degree in social work.</span> <span id="s602">And I worked for almost a year for Montgomery County, and then we went to Syracuse, and my two children were born there, and I went back to work as a social worker.</span> <span id="s603">And after being in Syracuse for about eight years, we moved back to the Maryland area, and we've been here ever since.</span> <span id="s604">That's been since 1970.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Was your husband a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: My husband came here at the age of 2.</span> <span id="s607">He was brought over here by relatives from Pittsburgh, but and he was born in Germany, but he came here before the war actually started.</span> <span id="s608">So even though technically by our museum standards he is a survivor, he doesn't feel that way because he really doesn't remember anything that happened prior.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: How do you think all of your experiences as a child affected your subsequent life?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: You know, I never thought about it very much, because it really wasn't the "in" thing when I was growing up.</span> <span id="s611">People didn't talk about the war, and people didn't talk about the atrocities and whatnot.</span> <span id="s612">And I guess it was not until maybe the mid '70s when a friend of one of my friends with whom I worked was writing a book about children of the Holocaust, and my friend Joan said would you talk to Ina, Ina Friedman.</span> <span id="s613">And the book is called Escape or Die.</span> <span id="s614">And she said would you talk to her, because she's really interested in your background.</span> <span id="s615">And I had to talk to my mother, because I couldn't really put my finger on things, and my mother didn't really want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s616">But I did remember, and so I talked to Ina, and Ina wrote the book.</span> <span id="s617">And the tapes of that are at Yad Vashem, and then she sent me the book.</span> <span id="s618">And I don't know if my story was all that interesting, but I was very organized, because the way she's written it is pretty much exactly what I said to her.</span> <span id="s619">And then I continued working.</span> <span id="s620">My children grew up, and my daughter is married.</span> <span id="s621">She's a physician and she's married to a physician.</span> <span id="s622">And my son is visiting me now, and he's in the music field.</span> <span id="s623">I've been married for 36 years to the same man, which is kind of nice.</span> <span id="s624">And in 1994 I retired from my job with Montgomery County.</span> <span id="s625">I had been a therapist with emotionally disturbed children, and I went to work as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s626">And it's very, very meaningful for me to work as a volunteer, because I feel I survived, and so I have to give back.</span> <span id="s627">And I work in the Department of Collections, which I think is the best department in the whole museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Why do you think that's the best?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Because the people are just the most giving, caring, talented people I have ever met, and they're so dedicated.</span> <span id="s630">And my boss, Susie Goldstein, is just a gem.</span> <span id="s631">She's a young woman, she's my daughter's age, but she's so brilliant in terms of what she knows.</span> <span id="s632">And we collect artifacts, you know, we get them from people, and we catalog them.</span> <span id="s633">And a lot of the things are Polish documents and Polish postcards and Polish diaries, and I translate those because my Polish is still pretty good.</span> <span id="s634">I speak well, and I read well, but my writing is atrocious, because, as I said, I only went through second grade.</span> <span id="s635">And I think I'll work at the Holocaust Museum until they carry me out, because it's just a very, very nice thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: How did you decide that you would like to work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I think once the museum opened and when I stopped working, I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do volunteer work, and this seemed to be just the right thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: And is most of your work there translating?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I translate, I type, I file.</span> <span id="s640">I do whatever, whatever they ask me to do, but my primary job is translating.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: And how much time do you spend there?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: At this point I'm going one day a week, but when it gets warmer I think I will go two days a week.</span> <span id="s643">And now we survivor volunteers are going to be involved with the Kovno Exhibit.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: With the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Kovno is the Jewish ghetto in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s648">The exhibit is opening the 19th and 20th, I believe, or the 20th and 21st of November, and we're going to be involved in making sure that the survivors of the ghetto get to the museum and the busses take them, and then have a hospitality suite that we're going to have for them.</span> <span id="s649">There were a lot of survivors apparently that are coming to this exhibit.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And this project is being done, did you say, by the survivor volunteers at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s652">We're going to be just helping.</span> <span id="s653">Oh, no, this has been a severalyear project that's been going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: So the survivor volunteer group at the museum</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: is especially active</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: in this project?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s660">We're going to be the hosts and hostesses that are going to be welcoming the survivors of the Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s661">And it's just for the opening, it's just going to be for the two days of the opening.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Could you say something about the survivor volunteers as a group at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s664">We started meeting with Martin Goldman, who is a gem, and we're discussing issues, things that concern us and the things that we'd like to see happening in the museum.</span> <span id="s665">I guess we'd like to have a little bit of a voice in what's going on, because once we go, you're not going to get any more survivor volunteers, we're it, we're the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">And that's the other group that's so very dedicated, that I am so impressed with, is how dedicated the people are, and you know, we talk and we're kind of a support group to each other, which is kind of nice, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So you're a group within a group?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s669">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Are there other survivor volunteers in the collections department?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s672">Yes, there's we come on different days, so I don't really know them, but there's a woman who translates French, and there's another woman who translates Polish, and she goes to the Linthicum, which is the warehouse for the collections department where we have a lot of the artifacts there, too, and she translates.</span> <span id="s673">She just doesn't like to come downtown, so she prefers to go to Linthicum.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: So you have a lot of feelings about your work with the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And the museum itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s678">I think it's a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s679">It's very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: What about in your personal social life?</span> <span id="s681">Are you involved with survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s683">I don't know any survivors.</span> <span id="s684">You know, my friends are from my work or my husband's work.</span> <span id="s685">We play bridge.</span> <span id="s686">We play bridge with the same six couples for 25 years, we play duplicate bridge, we meet at each other's homes, and we're sort of a tight group.</span> <span id="s687">And then I have friends from my early days, from college, and a lot of my sorority sisters are living in this area.</span> <span id="s688">And in fact it's kind of cute, but one of the young women in the collections department is a sorority sister, you know, 30 years apart, but still we laugh about it that we were in sorority together.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So your friends are mostly not</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Right.</span> <span id="s693">I mean, I don't if they happen to be survivors, that's fine, but I don't think I look for survivors.</span> <span id="s694">Most of the survivors that I've met are at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: And do you see people that you work with at the museum outside of the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Not really, but we're going to because we're going to have to plan all these things for the opening of Kovno, so we're going to be getting together as a group and discussing how we're going to do these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: And what about being Jewish?</span> <span id="s698">The last we talked about that in the interview, you were still a child.</span> <span id="s699">What happened to that confusion?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Well, I'm very I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s701">I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s702">I get I still get a fuzzy, nice fuzzy feeling when I go into a church, and I've gone to weddings and I'm very comfortable in a Catholic church.</span> <span id="s703">But I'm Jewish and my children are Jewish and my soninlaw is Jewish.</span> <span id="s704">When my daughter was married, I had no family at the wedding, obviously, so I really maintain my husband's family.</span> <span id="s705">He comes from a very large family with lots of cousins and aunts and uncles, and I maintain that relationship.</span> <span id="s706">And my daughter's inlaws are really fantastic people.</span> <span id="s707">Their name's Herskowitz, and they've sorted of adopted me so I feel like I do have a family, which is very important.</span> <span id="s708">And I wonder what would have happened if there had been no war and if I had lived in my cocoon in Poland.</span> <span id="s709">My parents came from welltodo families.</span> <span id="s710">We had lots of servants.</span> <span id="s711">We had, you know, everything that we could desire, and we lost everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: What do you imagine would have happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I guess we would have stayed there.</span> <span id="s714">My father was, you know, a physician in the spa.</span> <span id="s715">Probably would have traveled, probably would have gone skiing in Switzerland or whatever, and I wouldn't have had these experiences, so I guess everything happens for a reason.</span> <span id="s716">But my mother was a very strong woman, obviously, because she saved us, and my mother always said if you have something, if you have money or whatever, you need to spend it, because if you don't, the devil comes and takes it.</span> <span id="s717">So you really need to enjoy if you have things.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: And have you lived by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s720">Yes.</span> <span id="s721">You know, we like to travel, and we go skiing a lot, and we have a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: And what about your Jewish religion as far as involvement in a synagogue or observance of holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: We observe all the holidays, and if Ellen, my daughter's motherinlaw, does Rosh Hoshana, then I do Passover, or vice versa.</span> <span id="s724">We do a lot of things together.</span> <span id="s725">That's very important because it's family, you know, it's more than just observing a holiday, it's family.</span> <span id="s726">You don't have to go to synagogue, you can just feel it in your heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: So that has evolved for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Into something meaningful?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: And what about having children?</span> <span id="s732">What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Well, my children were luckier than I was.</span> <span id="s734">They had two parents all the time.</span> <span id="s735">Even when we moved, they had two parents.</span> <span id="s736">You know, they're very, very nice young people, so I guess we've done a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: What</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I'm looking forward to grandchildren someday.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: What was it like for you when your children were the age that you were when you were in the ghetto and in hiding, and they were having a life very different from the life that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I didn't you know, I didn't even think about it.</span> <span id="s741">Having children was such a special miraculous kind of a thing, and watching them grow and do all the things, and taking pictures of them and just enjoying everything they did.</span> <span id="s742">I did you know, I didn't really compare.</span> <span id="s743">You know, they went to Hebrew school and they had Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and they grew up to be nice people.</span> <span id="s744">That's the most important thing.</span> <span id="s745">The past is sort of a prelude to the future, I guess.</span> <span id="s746">You can't dwell on it because you can't undo it, you can't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s747">I think it's made me a stronger person, but if I could change it, I would have rather not had that kind of a past.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: What have I not asked you that I should have?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s750">You're very thorough.</span> <span id="s751">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to say or anything else you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No, I guess I would just encourage people to come to the museum, because it's a very special place.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s755">Well, thank you very much for your contribution and for giving your testimony today.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer Collection interview with Elizabeth Strassburger.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
