she knows but my parents belonged to a social club which did not admit</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">12:19 Q: I noticed that all the Jewish literature you have is recent.</span> <span id="s18">Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">M: Because until then, with the exception of The Diary of Anne Frank, nobody really talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">13:35 M: My son applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War, so before then we had never really talked about it.</span> <span id="s21">He knew I had been involved against the Germans and he knew that we had both worked in displaced persons camps after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">T: We met after the war while we were working in the displaced person camps.</span> <span id="s23">I was in the army.</span> <span id="s24">Then I was discharged, and we moved to the states, and had two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Why did you not talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">M: No one was interested.</span> <span id="s27">Everyone was tired about hearing about</span></p> <p><span id="s28">it.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What were you doing at that point, when the occupations began?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">M: I wanted to go to medical school to be a psychiatrist but you had to be 19 to be accepted to medical school.</span> <span id="s31">I was 18 when I graduated, so I decided to spend half the year in England and half the year in Switzerland so I could work for a social services agency and get some experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: This was in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">19:16 M: I was in England in September 1939 when the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">I stayed there with my parents.</span> <span id="s35">As the Dutch weren't in World War 1, we expected to stay out of it.</span> <span id="s36">I left in November, on the last plane out.</span> <span id="s37">In January of 1939 I went to work in a little town called Nijwegen, a little town about 15 miles from the German border where there were factories where children worked.</span> <span id="s38">Most of these children were from large Catholic families.</span> <span id="s39">They would come there after work to a settlement house to learn how to sew, cook, clean, etc, So I was there when the Germans came on the 10 May.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">When we got up in the morning we could hear the planes overhead.</span> <span id="s41">I was living with a family whose youngest child had just come up for army service.</span> <span id="s42">The Germans just came in and we were totally unprepared.</span> <span id="s43">The Dutch Army was kind of a joke, anyway.</span> <span id="s44">They were using old WWI airplanes.</span> <span id="s45">They held off the Germans for 5 days, though.</span> <span id="s46">After a few days I rode my bike to Amsterdam to see if my family was alright.</span> <span id="s47">Everything was fine; the apartment was fine.</span> <span id="s48">I stayed a few days, then went back to Nijwegen.</span> <span id="s49">In the fall I started the School of Social Service in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">M: Being occupied is a shock, to say the least.</span> <span id="s51">You only gradually become aware of it.</span> <span id="s52">The Germans did not immediately start segregating and attacking the Jews.</span> <span id="s53">It's much easier to segregate the population if the rest of the population is with you-not against you.</span> <span id="s54">So they start with propaganda, and they start with a</span></p> <p><span id="s55">film.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">The film was called, "The Eternal Jew."</span> <span id="s57">One of the instructors told us to go and see it, and we laughed out loud.</span> <span id="s58">It was totally ridiculous.</span> <span id="s59">One of the students said the next day that 23:58 they didn't believe a word of it but what it had done is that it has divided us into they and us.</span> <span id="s60">But now I look at people and say,"Hey, you're Jewish."</span> <span id="s61">There is a difference now.</span> <span id="s62">There were those people who were bound and determined to help the Jews but the split had been made.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Was the film made in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">M: Yes, it was German, as far as I know it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: So that was the early steps?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">M: That was what was so diabolically clever about it.</span> <span id="s67">It was the "inclementality" if I can use that word.</span> <span id="s68">The first official thing that they did was to forbid the Jews to be a part of the Civilian Air Patrol.</span> <span id="s69">The steps were so small, which was clever, because it did it not give you a reason to protest.</span> <span id="s70">Then there was the important step-which no one realized called the "Aryan Station" in that they sent two forms to all people who were in professions in the government, teachers, doctors, etc. if you were Aryan you filled out form A and if you were Jewish you filled out form B. of course it was a tremendous help to the Germans to figure out who was Jewish and who was not.</span> <span id="s71">But very few people saw that-almost everyone signed it.</span> <span id="s72">Like with all those measures it was under penalty of death and deportation if you didn't do what they told you.</span> <span id="s73">That was always the threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">26:29 Q: There wasn't a government also-besides the occupational</span></p> <p><span id="s75">government?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">M: There was a difference between Holland and France or Holland and Denmark because in Holland the Germans took over the civilian</span></p> <p><span id="s77">administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So in other words there was no one to say, "Don't anyone fill these out?</span> <span id="s79">As in the Danish case?"</span></p> <p><span id="s80">M: That was very local.</span> <span id="s81">The President of one university said don't fill it out.</span> <span id="s82">There was one high school principal, I think it was the Amsterdam Lyceum, who told his staff, too, don't fill it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Your father had this important position in the government before, so what did he do through all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">M: He didn't sign.</span> <span id="s85">There were no immediate repercussions but of course the Germans took prominent people hostage so when the resistance did something they didn't like they would take out five or ten people and shoot them.</span> <span id="s86">When they came to get my father in 1942 he was so ill with cancer that they didn't bother.</span> <span id="s87">I think one of the reasons that they came to get him was because he didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s88">sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">T: There was no "Dutch" Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">29:00 Q: One of the problems was that so many Dutch collaborated</span></p> <p><span id="s91">with the Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">M: Well they cooperated with various degrees of collaboration.</span> <span id="s93">Some of the Burgermeisters were excellent, but some were not.</span> <span id="s94">For instance, there's the story of the Burgermeister of Amsterdam who was dealing with the Nazis who told him, "Now we have to deal with the Jewish problem" and he told them, "We don't have a Jewish problem; we have a German problem."</span> <span id="s95">The degree of collaboration varied greatly-even within the police departments.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">30:30 When they were trying to round up the Jews they tried to get the police to help them.</span> <span id="s97">Some did, some didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: I always say when I do interviews with rescuers that "I couldn't have done that myself."</span></p> <p><span id="s99">M: Well if someone had asked me before the war if I could have done that I don't know what I would have said.</span> <span id="s100">I didn't make any decisions - it started off with my friends; one of the many difficulties was that no one would believe it.</span> <span id="s101">My father had read "Mein Kampf" from beginning to end-and it said that all Jews were going to be exterminated from Europe.</span> <span id="s102">When I started to talk like that, when I told my Jewish friends and classmates they would be angry with me!</span> <span id="s103">No one would believe it.</span> <span id="s104">When the time comes for a decision to be made-that is when everything falls into place...when I did make a decision it was made later on, when I was taking care of the children myself full time and their father-and I heard that the Germans were coming to raid the area where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">I remember particularly where I knew that a certain house was going to be raided and I didn't know if they had been warned.</span> <span id="s106">I made the decision not to go warn them because what would happen to them, my own kids, if the Germans came when I wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">33:50 You can say that was a very good decision to make; you were responsible but you can also say it was chicken.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">H: That's what I meant about "shades"; Marion's brother when they had to wear stars-he put a star on.</span> <span id="s109">That was a "step."</span></p> <p><span id="s110">M: My brother and his friends all put stars on-they were 12 years old.</span> <span id="s111">My mother told him to take it off, but my father supported it.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">M: My brother had another experience with the Germans.</span> <span id="s113">Just to show what kind of people they were.</span> <span id="s114">My brother and his friend were walking home from school and the Gestapo headquarters were between my home and the school and they were calling the Germans (?)</span> <span id="s115">which means dirty Kraut or something like that and the Germans overheard.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">They took them in to the building and held them.</span> <span id="s117">After about three quarters of an hour they let my brother go but the other boy-they called his mother and asked her if they would give him a beating or did she want her husband arrested.</span> <span id="s118">Of course she was fixing lunch for the children-she told them to give the boy a beating.</span> <span id="s119">They told her to come and pick him up, and when she did, he was dead-12 years</span></p> <p><span id="s120">old.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">M: Well when you talk about the decision-it reminds me of the Kresch(?)</span> <span id="s122">which were day care centers where they collected Jews for deportation.</span> <span id="s123">The adults were sent to the theater and the children were next door at the day care center.</span> <span id="s124">There was a lot of traffic between the theater and the day care center and the day care center workers smuggled 1000 Jewish children from the center-the teacher's college helped place the children in foster homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Something I wanted to mention were all the people that helped...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">M: There was also, near where I lived, there was a house where there was anywhere from 17-20 people.</span> <span id="s127">One day I was asked to kidnap a child, and did.</span> <span id="s128">I just knew she was in danger so I went and got her.</span> <span id="s129">When I was in Holland last November someone gave me a book written by the mother that had the circumstances surrounding her story.</span> <span id="s130">What happened was that she-they were betrayed-they took in too many-everyone knew they would be betrayed because there were too many in (45:00) the house.</span> <span id="s131">They asked the Gestapo while they were in the house if they would take the children-while they were searching for the others in the house-if they could take the children to the two local village doctors so they wouldn't have to go to jail-the Gestapo agreed but they did make the doctors promise that they wouldn't release the children to anyone but the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">They took the girl's mother, Lince, to Gestapo headquarters and they interrogated her but she refused to talk so they said, "We'll get your child-then you'll talk."</span> <span id="s133">and her husband managed to escape while being taken from headquarters to jail and he warned people in the village and got word to me to go and pick her up.</span> <span id="s134">And with me was Karel Poons, who was gay and Jewish-double jeopardy.</span> <span id="s135">The night before we had tried to get the doctor to give her to us voluntarily but he refused, saying he had sworn a Christian oath 46:32 not to release her.</span> <span id="s136">They were furious when they got to the doctor's house, they arrested him.</span> <span id="s137">She said the Germans had posters everywhere looking for her.</span> <span id="s138">An interesting thing-when people asked me things now and I say I don't know it's not because I don't remember but because I tried not to know.</span> <span id="s139">The less you knew the less they could make you say if you were caught.</span> <span id="s140">The ballet dancer, we had hidden him with a woman painter-if you had two Jewish people and a family of five you had to make sure when the Germans came that there were not seven beds being slept in.</span> <span id="s141">The Jews slept with the rescuers which sometimes led to all sorts of abuse of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">This woman painter decided she was going to make Karel straight- sexually.</span> <span id="s143">After about two weeks-he came to me and said, "I can't stand it-l want to go to a concentration camp."</span> <span id="s144">So he moved to a little house in the garden.</span> <span id="s145">He didn't tell me anything he knew and I didn't tell him anything I knew that could cause trouble for us- even though in a lot of things we were in it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">M: Oh yes, he's 76 now-living in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: You've said in The Courage to Care that it was the film and then seeing the children taken away in the trucks was when you decided</span></p> <p><span id="s149">to help...</span></p> <p><span id="s150">M: No, before that because at that time I was already helping friends.</span> <span id="s151">I had never seen, at that time, the Germans in action but I knew about the threats.</span> <span id="s152">That time I saw them was when I decided to help the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: When did you hide the first person?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">53:12</span></p> <p><span id="s155">M: A man I knew-we found him a place to hide and I took him food-he lived with a family.</span> <span id="s156">A lot of people would take either one but not both of Jews.</span> <span id="s157">One would take adults but not children and vice</span></p> <p><span id="s158">versa.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">M: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What are the numbers of people that you helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">M: I helped in so many degrees.</span> <span id="s163">There was a couple who had gone into hiding and while in hiding she became pregnant-and the family that we had hidden them with couldn't hide the baby.</span> <span id="s164">So we went to a high school teacher-a friend in Rotterdam-and asked them to take the baby when it was born.</span> <span id="s165">We asked them because they had been giving money.</span> <span id="s166">They said yes, so the wife pretended to be pregnant and when the baby was born I took it to stay with them.</span> <span id="s167">I spent a total of a week or so there's so many I only knew for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s168">So if I had to guess I'd say about 150-that includes the most</span></p> <p><span id="s169">casual of contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: So did the baby and/or his parents survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">M: The parents did not, but the baby did.</span> <span id="s172">He was born prematurely so I stayed with him for a week.</span> <span id="s173">When I was there they had prepared a splendid nursery for him but they didn't care anything about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">However I heard from a friend after the war that they had totally accepted him and, when the parents never came back, they adopted him.</span> <span id="s175">What they were debating at the time was whether to tell him or not; I don't know if that was a good idea or not to not tell him.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So you think they should tell him?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">57:03 M: Well that leads me to when I was working in the Displaced Persons Camps.</span> <span id="s178">Lots of people had been brought to Germany by force and we were trying to help them get back to where they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Lots of DP's were talking about their American relatives-and one boy, Aaron Schneider, who was about 14 years old, had American relatives, an aunt and an uncle in Brooklyn and I started enthusiastically processing him to go to the United States and the head of the Jewish Council came to me and said, "You can't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">We Jews have lost a million children.</span> <span id="s181">We are going to establish a new world."</span> <span id="s182">But I said, "He wants to go to America."</span> <span id="s183">A few days later I returned to find my office ransacked and papers and stuff thrown everywhere to prevent this from happening.</span> <span id="s184">In retrospect I'm surprised they didn't do worse.</span> <span id="s185">I took the child to the Interstert(?)</span> <span id="s186">which was a children's search center-the Nazis had taken Aryan looking Jewish children and placed them with German parents.</span> <span id="s187">Interstert were trying to find them.</span> <span id="s188">They arranged for him to get to the US.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Another time, back during to the war I had brought a baby to a farmhouse in the country.</span> <span id="s190">They told me apologetically when I left that they had told the children in the house that this was my illegitimate baby so that when the neighbors asked where the new baby came from the children would tell the right story.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So when did you see your mother during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">M: I remember telling my mother once to not tell anyone that I had brought a Jewish man home with me and she said of course not, but the next morning my mother asked the milkman for an extra quart of milk because we had an "underground" with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">1:07 Q: Did she have any idea, what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">M: Yes, she has some vague idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">M: In the back of a friend of her's house, was a little house where her son-in-law arranged for me and a father and three Jewish children to live- the father being a friend of the son-in-law (the son-in-law was the director of the Municipal Electrical(?)</span> <span id="s196">works) one of the things that he did-well there was this old communications system that had been built over by a</span></p> <p><span id="s197">1:09:40 new one and was not in use anymore-he revitalized it for the resistance so that, under the nose of the Germans and all who worked for the communications system we could send the messages to England and internally.</span> <span id="s198">It was this man whose wife asked me if I could hide the Jewish father and his three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Have they kept in touch with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">M: The father died about three years ago.</span> <span id="s201">After the war he had appointments to two Dutch universities-he was the director of the Dutch Central Economic Planning.</span> <span id="s202">He was a prolific writer.</span> <span id="s203">While in hiding he'd take down a lantern and some paper and write books.</span> <span id="s204">He worked during the day at a house across the street as to maintain the fiction that there were just those three children there-somehow it seemed safer.</span> <span id="s205">One time when the Germans came during the day the</span></p> <p><span id="s206">oldest boy-they asked</span></p> <p><span id="s207">1:11:45 him where his father was and the boy-he was about five at the time said, "You took him away yourself!"</span> <span id="s208">He was very convincing-and of course the father hadn't been taken away.</span> <span id="s209">After the war the son took a Gentile name and eventually joined Lufthansa.</span> <span id="s210">Erika, the little one, emphasizes her "Germaneness"-she called her daughters Erika and Esther-and the other boy is an administrator in Germany.</span> <span id="s211">I don't understand-we told them to be Gentile-and German-and we taught them with rosaries and crucifixes to be Catholic in case the Germans questioned them.</span> <span id="s212">I guess we can't expect them to just give it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">T: There was a story now-in Holland-about how child survivors didn't know they were Jewish and were confused at the end of the</span></p> <p><span id="s214">war.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">1:17:13 Q: How did you end up in Jewish displaced person camps</span></p> <p><span id="s216">after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">T: I don't know.</span> <span id="s218">I was in the army-fought my way through from the coast of France to deep Turingen.</span> <span id="s219">In fact, my division went into Buchenwald 6th Armored Artillery Division-and we didn't have enough military commanders-so I found myself in charge of an area.</span> <span id="s220">Anyway, I was wounded, and my commander promised me leave, and while on the plane to London I saw a copy of the Stars and Stripes-they had an article about the DP camps.</span> <span id="s221">So I went to the London office and applied, and they hired me on the spot.</span> <span id="s222">Then after the war she and I married in Germany and I came back to school.</span> <span id="s223">At that time they started the IRO which was the International Refugee Organization and we had to decide whether we wanted to continue it or not, so we decided to go to the US.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: How long did the camps last?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">T: I got out of college in 1950 and they were still around.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: After what you saw in the war, did you talk about your</span></p> <p><span id="s227">experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">M: So many people told me they didn't talk about their experiences</span></p> <p><span id="s229">1:22:00 because of guilt because so many of their colleagues died, and they lived.</span> <span id="s230">I didn't see things that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">T: I don't think either of us decided to talk about our experiences in the war or in the DP camps until this letter came from the Israeli consulate totally out of the blue-saying that Marion had</span></p> <p><span id="s232">won a metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">M: We never talked about it because there was always something else to do.</span> <span id="s234">We never asked the DP's to talk about their experiences because we knew what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s235">When we came over here in September of 1947 I called the Jewish agency in Boston and said that I knew about the relatively small number of Jewish DP's who</span></p> <p><span id="s236">were coming</span></p> <p><span id="s237">1:25:57 to the US would need help so I went down to their office and interviewed with them and they told me they were sorry but it was their philosophy not to hire Gentiles.</span> <span id="s238">So I said that was too bad and went to work for the New England Medical Center.</span> <span id="s239">They called me the next year and asked me if I was still interested and I said yes and so they hired me because I speak fluent Yiddish.</span> <span id="s240">I learned it from them at the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">M: Our director (at the camps) was a man called Dominic Capolungo who was a close friend of Fiorello LaGuardia and he was not interested at all in the DP camps-anyway, Lieutenant Grup(?)</span> <span id="s242">, a Texas ranger, shot a Jewish person in the leg and as a result everything was shaken up and we were all fired except me and a</span></p> <p><span id="s243">nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">M: In the Jewish agency in Boston there was a great upheaval-l went from a junior case worker to a senior case worker to a district supervisor all on the strength of my Yiddish.</span> <span id="s245">We had agreed not to have any children until he finished college but I got pregnant while working at the Jewish center and gave birth to a son on Christmas day-we called it the second immaculate conception- Anyway, so I stayed home and took care of kids for six years.</span> <span id="s246">By this time we were so busy we never talked about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">1:30:58</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You stayed home with the children for six years?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">M: Then I went to work for a very fancy private psychiatric hospital in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: By this time you had finished medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">M: I never went to medical school.</span> <span id="s252">When the Germans came they tried to make everyone swear the loyalty oath but I didn't do it, and I don't blame the people who swore it with mental reservations.</span> <span id="s253">They never found the social work school because it wasn't near the rest of the universities-so I went there and completed it in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So you gave up your life entirely after that during the war to</span></p> <p><span id="s255">the rescue effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">M: I didn't really think of it as giving up my life-l didn't think</span></p> <p><span id="s257">about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Could you have done anything else had you not done that?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">M: I didn't think about doing anything else.</span> <span id="s260">I just wanted to make sure that I could do everything I could to help out-I'd been asked to take care of a man and his children and I was sort of doing that part time and I couldn't wait to move in and do it full time-then after the war was over-I'd been taking care of a baby for almost three years since she was a week old, and then I had to give it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">It was hard.</span> <span id="s262">So when I saw an ad in the newspaper asking for people to work in displaced person camps...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">1:32:20 I went there for two reasons: one, it was a job and two, I thought that I'd find out quicker what happened to some of my</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: When did this medal come?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">M: First there was this letter from the Israeli consulate telling me that there would be a medal-they called and told me about the Revisionist movement in Chicago about people who were trying to prove that the Holocaust never happened-they wanted to show it for publicity.</span> <span id="s267">I didn't start telling about it for a long time-the first time was in a synagogue in Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s268">I am very much a follower of Elie Wiesel who believes that one must tell the story over and over-I was astonished to find myself slightly weepy.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: It must be difficult-painful- for you to remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s270">M: It's not as hard now as it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: When did you tell your children about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">M: I have three-a single one and a set of twins.</span> <span id="s273">I'd had a picture of Erika-the littlest one- on my desk for most of my life and I'd asked them who they thought she was and they said they thought she was me when I was little.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">T: They were in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">M: One has a Ph.D in History, one has a Ph.D in Philosophy, and one went to Dartmouth and works for the Department of Education.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: What was their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">M: They were interested; they were surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">T: They're proud of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Did you see your children doing that sort of thing-doing what</span></p> <p><span id="s281">you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">M: They are all incredibly good fathers-also our son arranged a conference on Ethics in Washington on building character.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">1:49:06</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: What would you want your grandchildren to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">M: I don't know how children, especially small children, can differentiate between what happened 50 years ago and 1000 years ago.</span> <span id="s286">It's very difficult to know.</span> <span id="s287">I think what's not so important is knowing but how the parents behave against anti-Semitism or</span></p> <p><span id="s288">anti-blackism or anti-anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: How can you say the war years marked you, or changed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">1:54:06 M: I don't think I would be all that different.</span> <span id="s291">The reason I went for a career in psychoanalysis was because I wanted to see how Hitler could get so many people to do what he wanted.</span> <span id="s292">But I always wanted to be a psychiatrist-even before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Do you think it could happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">M: Well I saw it happen but I naively thought that it would end.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">But the problem is now that it's not just the Jews- I thought that everyone could have wanted to help them-establish Israel and so forth-but I see all the murders, abuse, etc.</span> <span id="s296">I'm less optimistic about humanity than I was 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s297">If you want to raise a generation of people who care about each other and who really sacrifice for each other each mother should sacrifice a few years of her career to stay home and take care of the children to show them they're important.</span> <span id="s298">If the mother doesn't show the child she's willing to sacrifice for him because he's important why should the child think that anyone else is important?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">TAPE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s300">8:00</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: What was your reaction to fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">M: I think I had my mother's ability to ignore fear until I spent some time in jail.</span> <span id="s303">You carry the fear with you always on some level.</span> <span id="s304">I remember in Amsterdam the only people who had trucks during the war so whenever you heard the truck you knew the Germans were coming.</span> <span id="s305">When I first came here whenever I heard a truck in the middle of the night I got scared- especially if he [her husband]</span></p> <p><span id="s306">wasn't here.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">.</span> <span id="s308">END.</span></p></body></html>
