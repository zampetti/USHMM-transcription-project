Mandel.</span> <span id="s17">The Y, of course, stands for Yehudah.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Where were you born and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in a very small village called Csepe, spelled C-S-E-P-E in Hungary.</span> <span id="s20">That in the part of Hungary which was extremely religious.</span> <span id="s21">Later on, it became .</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What year were you born?</span> <span id="s23">A: In 1904, March the 3rd.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Will you tell me about your parents and about your family as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: This village or rather the inhabitants, Jewish inhabitants of this village, were extremely religious, very observant people, and so, of course, were my parents.</span> <span id="s26">My father who had ordination to be a Rabbi studied in his youth as a..</span> <span id="s27">.</span> <span id="s28">different Yeshivas, but he never was a Rabbi to be employed as a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s29">My mother was a sweet, wonderful soul who unfortunately ended in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s30">My father died at age 53.</span> <span id="s31">Now we were seven brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s32">I had three sisters and beside myself...I'm the oldest one of the boys...there were other three boys.</span> <span id="s33">You want me to give you the names.</span> <span id="s34">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: No.</span> <span id="s36">We'll get the names later.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: What...uh...Tell me about what your life was like as children.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: As children, everybody's life was the same as mine, so I will tell you about my own life.</span> <span id="s39">At the age of 3, 3 and a half, maybe 4...uh...I started to go to Cheder.</span> <span id="s40">That's the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s41">And I think when I was four, maybe 4 and a half years old, I read Hebrew very well.</span> <span id="s42">I, of course, didn't understand, but I knew how to read Hebrew very well.</span> <span id="s43">And I went on through that Cheder and in that Cheder where we started first to learn prayers.</span> <span id="s44">Later on we extended to other things, like the Bible and so on.</span> <span id="s45">And...uh...this occupied our lives.</span> <span id="s46">We went to Cheder in the morning about 6:30, stayed there, had a service in the Cheder proper, a daily service, and at 8 o'clock, we had to go to the public school.</span> <span id="s47">We were in the public school until ll:00.</span> <span id="s48">From ll:00 to 12:00, we went back to the Cheder, and were there until noontime.</span> <span id="s49">The main meal in Europe, you know, used to be in noontime.</span> <span id="s50">And...uh....in the afternoon, the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s51">After we had lunch, we went back to the regular school and...uh...at 4:00 when we were dismissed, we went back to Cheder until about 6:00 or 6:30.</span> <span id="s52">And this is...this was their current day by day, day after day.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What was it like being a Jew in that town?</span> <span id="s54">Was there much anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s55">Were you comfortable?</span> <span id="s56">This village had two...uh.</span> <span id="s57">.</span> <span id="s58">churches.</span> <span id="s59">One was a Greek Catholic church, and the other was a reform church.</span> <span id="s60">The priest of the Greek Catholic church did announce before Passover...weeks before Passover...that now will come the time when the Jews are looking for blood to the...for the Matzahs.</span> <span id="s61">Now you can imagine what impression this made on the inhabitants and the children who were taught by this priest and his helpers.</span> <span id="s62">So that it happened that when we came out of the Cheder, our own age children were waiting for us with big heavy sticks to beat up the Jewish children, Jews, because we killed Christ and so on.</span> <span id="s63">That the...all, that's all they knew.</span> <span id="s64">The reformed priest...uh...priest, he was more consilient.</span> <span id="s65">And from that school...from that church, we have never heard this kind of...uh...pronouncement, let's say.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: As a young boy, you early became interested in music.</span> <span id="s67">Uh...Tell me how you became interested in music and what happened with the music.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I did not become or rather I wasn't able to study music, if you are referring to study music, and prepare myself for my profession.</span> <span id="s69">However, I knew one thing.</span> <span id="s70">I had a very nice, pleasant voice and when I was 8 years old, let's say, it was a rarity to...to happen, I was chosen to perform on the three festival days, the evening service, the Maror service.</span> <span id="s71">And I did that.</span> <span id="s72">And I had a very pleasant voice and that's all I knew, but there was no possibility to study music as much.</span> <span id="s73">I..</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">I couldn't do that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Tell us really about your growing up and how you did be...be able to study music eventually.</span> <span id="s77">A: I..</span> <span id="s78">.</span> <span id="s79">I was...I lived in my little community up to the age of my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s80">After Bar Mitzvah, I left...uh...my village, and I went to study in a place.</span> <span id="s81">It was close by, about 15 kilometers from our village.</span> <span id="s82">And I studied in Notchulus.</span> <span id="s83">That was the Capitol city of our State.</span> <span id="s84">I come from a State which was called Ugochar.</span> <span id="s85">And while being there, we had a special minyan for the Bikurim...for the Bikurim.</span> <span id="s86">And the Birkurim minyan....</span> <span id="s87">uh...being that my friends and the other students knew I have a pleasant voice I was always asked and...uh... sometimes forced to perform the services like the Musaf services on Sabbath or when it was Rosh Hodesh, something like that.</span> <span id="s88">So from there on, I knew that I have voice...a voice and it seemed to be I have a nice voice because I was engaged by a who...who...who served a larger community to sing with him at...in his choir on the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s89">That was all musical...uh...preparation I could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Tell us about what happened.</span> <span id="s91">Follow your growing up for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Now, I stayed in Nocholus for 2 years.</span> <span id="s93">And there I..</span> <span id="s94">.</span> <span id="s95">we were not allowed to go to regular public schools.</span> <span id="s96">We had to prepare our studies privately and take exams at end of the season, at end of the year in the public schools from or given by teachers who were public school teachers.</span> <span id="s97">And I finished there Junior High in Nocholus.</span> <span id="s98">I studied in Yeshiva, and studied privately for the exams in the Junior...Junior High School.</span> <span id="s99">I stayed in Nocholus up until 19...1918, and from there because the Rabbi in a certain big place, big congregation, big city, Umgra was a former schoolmate of my father and they studied together.</span> <span id="s100">They were .</span></p> <p><span id="s101">My father insisted I should go to study in Umgra.</span> <span id="s102">I went and stayed there for close to 4 years.</span> <span id="s103">I got my first...uh....Hiruia from...from Umgra.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Your what?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Hiruia is the written...uh...document to be qualified as a Rabbi in , and from Umgra, I studied there up to the point where I was drafted into the Czech army.</span> <span id="s106">Now, in Umgra I don't have to tell you it was an extremely...uh... religious community as well, and for instance, we, Bikurim who studied under this Rabbi who I told you about before, were told that when we walk by the Reform Temple at a certain street we cannot...we shouldn't walk on the side of the temple.</span> <span id="s107">We have to cross the street and walk by to the next block and only then go back to that side of the street.</span> <span id="s108">This...from this can give you...uh...picture the way we lived.</span> <span id="s109">Now, one thing, however, was very good.</span> <span id="s110">The...uh...discipline, not only this which may sound here in America funny and foolish, but the discipline in every way was so immense, it's hard even to describe it.</span> <span id="s111">Everyone stuck to...to the...to the rules of...of Yeshiva, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s112">The best (clearing throat) (drinking water) (pause) To give you an idea how strict the discipline followed or...or prevailed there, I have to tell you a very little story.</span> <span id="s113">I had a nice voice, and when I was already about 15 or 16 years old, somehow the cantor of that community, of that congregation, which was strictly 100 percent an orthodox congregation, and their cantor was a man by the name Gottleb, who heard my voice and wanted me to join his choir.</span> <span id="s114">My father, who was a friend, former schoolmate of the Rabbi under whom I studied, came especially to Umgra to speak to this Rabbi and ask him could I, would I, would he allow me to sing in that choir.</span> <span id="s115">The Rabbi did not give me permission or whatever.</span> <span id="s116">He used to go to that shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s118">Take some water.</span> <span id="s119">Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: So I did not have the opportunity to study music even to the degree what this choir that sang in the Orthodox shul would have given me.</span> <span id="s121">And so I grew up without any musical background.</span> <span id="s122">However, I was a very good , which means I could lead any service and so on.</span> <span id="s123">The voice was nice and here I come again to a..</span> <span id="s124">.</span> <span id="s125">to a story...uh...in Umgra.</span> <span id="s126">Again, my friends who came together with me to Umgra from my previous Yeshiva knew that I have a nice voice and there was one Friday, a Rosh Hodesh.</span> <span id="s127">I'm sure you know what Rosh Hodesh is.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Explain it for the camera please.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: It is the first day of the month where in the olden days, of course, sacrifices used to be introduced in a..</span> <span id="s130">.</span> <span id="s131">in the Holy Temple, and now we observe this beginning of the month by having special services.</span> <span id="s132">We have included Hallel and Musaf service and so on.</span> <span id="s133">Now the Yeshiva in Umgra had a so-called where the Bikurim, the students of the Yeshiva, could get food.</span> <span id="s134">And they did.</span> <span id="s135">And people, very religious people from a neighboring village called or in Yiddish used to deliver the milk for the Yeshiva it should be...uh...100 percent kosher.</span> <span id="s136">And so...uh...uh...one day at where my classmates and other Bikurim forced me in...in...in to perform the service, the Musaf service.</span> <span id="s137">One man who brought milk in the big can walked by and heard me.</span> <span id="s138">And he asked one of the Bikurim who is the who is governing there.</span> <span id="s139">So he says he's not a .</span> <span id="s140">He's just a one of us, .</span></p> <p><span id="s141">And the man then waited for me until I was finished and spoke to me.</span> <span id="s142">Because this was very close to Umgra they would come and pick me up.</span> <span id="s143">Would I perform a service of Shavuot in their congregation...in his congregation.</span> <span id="s144">(Clearing Throat Pause) We went out there.</span> <span id="s145">Yeah.</span> <span id="s146">He also said I can invite as many friends as I want and they won't come back empty handed.</span> <span id="s147">So I performed the service, got paid...uh...in this and my friends were loaded up with all kind of goodies.</span> <span id="s148">Butter and cheese and...and eggs and what not.</span> <span id="s149">So everyone was very happy.</span> <span id="s150">Later on, this went from mouth to mouth and I was invited to different towns for little congregations, bigger congregations.</span> <span id="s151">I became a star.</span> <span id="s152">And I and this maintained myself financially plus my two brothers who came to study in the same Yeshiva later.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: When...as this developed, tell us what...when did you get your first...your own congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Now, after the Yeshiva...let me go back for a moment yet to the...to the Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s155">My father...before the brother was the youngest, David, brought up my...my youngest brother in short...in shorts to...to be introduced to the Rabbi and asked if he could join also.</span> <span id="s156">The three of us were already studying there, so maybe David could study too.</span> <span id="s157">And the Rabbi took a lot at him with the short pants and said, "No.”</span> <span id="s158">He told my ....my father gave this Rabbi...uh...a lot of ...uh...uh...honor.</span> <span id="s159">They used to be on first name term as young people.</span> <span id="s160">He called him Rebbe and he called my father Avrom.</span> <span id="s161">So he said to my father, "Avrom, I don't have a Cheder.</span> <span id="s162">I have a big Yeshiva.”</span> <span id="s163">So my father told him.</span> <span id="s164">I ask of you one thing.</span> <span id="s165">Listen to this young boy with the , the short pants.</span> <span id="s166">He knows the pages of Talmud by heart almost.</span> <span id="s167">The Rabbi gave him an exam and told my father, "You know what.</span> <span id="s168">Your fourth boy, David.</span> <span id="s169">Buy him long pants.</span> <span id="s170">He can study in Yeshiva.”</span> <span id="s171">Now you asked me when did I get my first professional...uh...engagement let's say.</span> <span id="s172">(Pause - drinking water) Actually, I got my first professional engagement when I was drafted into the Czech army.</span> <span id="s173">We finished the semester in Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s174">And I had to report to the...uh...military on the lst of October.</span> <span id="s175">However, it came out that the beginning of October were the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s176">So I traveled and finally I got the position in a place .</span> <span id="s177">And there I done the whole service.</span> <span id="s178">There was an orthodox congregation where I did the main service, the Musaf and so on.</span> <span id="s179">And in the Organ Temple in uh...the and other things.</span> <span id="s180">And actually, they paid me very well, and that was the amount of money I took along with me to the...to the Czech army and I was never...uh...I had enough money to...to help myself if I needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s182">By the Organ Temple, you mean the Reform Congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I mean the...it wasn't Reform as in...no.</span> <span id="s184">In Hungary, there were...there were differences.</span> <span id="s185">There was the Orthodox, the Nelro.</span> <span id="s186">Nelro didn't mean reform.</span> <span id="s187">It just meant that Jewish congregations were something like...here let's say, they're conservative.</span> <span id="s188">Some of them had organs.</span> <span id="s189">Some even had...had mixed choirs and there was the status quo when the two...namely, this is history, when orthodox departed from the Nelro congregations, there were some who didn't go on either side, but remained where they were status quo.</span> <span id="s190">No change.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s192">Okay.</span> <span id="s193">So you're now leaving the Czech army.</span> <span id="s194">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I served in the Czech army and maybe it's a very interesting thing too.</span> <span id="s196">And indicative of my life and the way I..</span> <span id="s197">.</span> <span id="s198">the way we were disciplined and the way we lived.</span> <span id="s199">At.</span> <span id="s200">.</span> <span id="s201">uh...the basic training which everyone had to follow...follow through, I think at the beginning of November when the birthday of the President of Czechoslovakia, at the time, Masaryk, which was President, was celebrated.</span> <span id="s202">Uh...First Lieutenant came out to the training grounds and asked if is there...if there is someone who has a nice voice and could sing the Yanick part in the .</span> <span id="s203">I never in my life up to the 20th birthday was in a movie or knew what opera is or knew what a note is or knew what music ...musical training is, but my friends who were from the same Yeshiva and in the same...uh...group...uh...told me, "Why don't you tell them.</span> <span id="s204">Why don't you go?</span> <span id="s205">You...you have a nice voice.”</span> <span id="s206">So finally one of them told him that this young man has a nice voice.</span> <span id="s207">And...uh...he said, "What he wants?</span> <span id="s208">Do I know what opera is?</span> <span id="s209">Could I learn it?"</span> <span id="s210">I said, "No, I have no idea what you are talking about.”</span> <span id="s211">So he gave me an order on a certain hour to see him in his office.</span> <span id="s212">He was the superintendent for...uh...entertainment for the...uh... military.</span> <span id="s213">The Czech army stressed very much learning of any kind.</span> <span id="s214">There were many, many people who came into the army and didn't know how to read and write.</span> <span id="s215">So the army taught them.</span> <span id="s216">And finally, he gave me an order to be in this hour, in a certain hour in his...uh...office.</span> <span id="s217">I went there.</span> <span id="s218">Uh...He asked me do I know this?</span> <span id="s219">Do I know?</span> <span id="s220">"No, I know nothing.”</span> <span id="s221">So the end was that he asked me to sing something, anything I want.</span> <span id="s222">So I sang a Hungarian song.</span> <span id="s223">And...uh...he liked it, and after that maybe for weeks and weeks, he taught me phrase by phrase, note by note the melody what to sing, how to sing.</span> <span id="s224">At the time, I didn't even speak Czech yet.</span> <span id="s225">So that was another question.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">However, I learned everything.</span> <span id="s227">And you know, at the time I was young and...and the brain...uh...uh...was good so I..</span> <span id="s228">.</span> <span id="s229">and the ear was good.</span> <span id="s230">I learned it.</span> <span id="s231">He said, "I will be along side of you at this performance.</span> <span id="s232">I will tell you and push you in when you have to go in and do and sing this and that.</span> <span id="s233">And I will motion to you when you have to come out.”</span> <span id="s234">And this is the way the...uh... went over.</span> <span id="s235">You can imagine what a great performance (laughing) it was...it was, but that's...that's the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: When did you leave the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: In 1926, April.</span> <span id="s238">I had a plan because I was influenced by a brother of my latest teachers, Litest Smiller, who told me that I have a beautiful voice, but it...it is not worth too much.</span> <span id="s239">I..</span> <span id="s240">.</span> <span id="s241">I don't know how to...I don't know any music.</span> <span id="s242">So I want...I thought....Yeah.</span> <span id="s243">One more thing about this...uh...First Lieutenant.</span> <span id="s244">This First Lieutenant went to the point, because he liked my voice and so on, and was a very decent person and said, "You have a beautiful voice.</span> <span id="s245">I will apply to the Division.”</span> <span id="s246">That's...uh...I don't know how many...uh...to the Division of...of I don't know what part of the military.</span> <span id="s247">"We have scholarships.</span> <span id="s248">I will try to get you a scholarship where you will be able to study for 4 years in the Academy and prepare yourself for...for...uh... operatic career.”</span> <span id="s249">I was flabbergasted and I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't dare even to tell my parents, namely my father, that this kind of a happiness and great career was standing before me.</span> <span id="s250">However, I had an uncle, my brother...my mother's brother who was a lawyer, who studied in Budapest and came down, was a lawyer later on in our vicinity.</span> <span id="s251">Was about 40 miles...40 kilometers from our village.</span> <span id="s252">I wrote to him.</span> <span id="s253">I didn't dare to approach my father directly.</span> <span id="s254">So he went over and told my father about this big luck, tremendous thing what...what I'm confronted with.</span> <span id="s255">And my father's answer was, "Moshe,"...that was his...my uncle's name...."We have four sons and three daughters.</span> <span id="s256">If ...that's my Yiddish name...will do that he will go to the and desecrate the Sabbath, and desecrate the High...the Holy Days and sing in this career," which in my...in his own opinion wasn't...uh...the way a Yid should lead his life, "then please tell me that we have only three sons and three girls.”</span> <span id="s257">That's a cruel thing, but it ended my operatic career, so when I came home... My father wanted, of course...I was already 20...in my 2lst year, I should get married and settle there in a beautiful store, very rich people, and the only thing I would have to do is count the money and be in the...and so on.</span> <span id="s258">Uh...So I didn't want this.</span> <span id="s259">I wanted still to go privately and study music.</span> <span id="s260">And my father didn't give in on the other hand, so the deal between us was made.</span> <span id="s261">No Academy of music.</span> <span id="s262">No marriage.</span> <span id="s263">But back to Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s264">And then I went back to Yeshiva to Pressberg where I studied for about...uh...2 years and that was my last Yeshiva, and there I got my second which is....you know what a is?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Explain it for the camera.</span> <span id="s266">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: is again a written document of the Rabbinic court that the person is qualified to be a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s268">That was the second part.</span> <span id="s269">From there, from Vienna which is very close to...from , Pressberg, which is very close to once in a..</span> <span id="s270">.</span> <span id="s271">in awhile I used to go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s272">I had a teacher there and there I already I already started to learn some music.</span> <span id="s273">However, I stayed the Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s274">I..</span> <span id="s275">.</span> <span id="s276">I couldn't leave the Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Did you father and the Yeshiva head know that you were study?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: He wouldn't have like it.</span> <span id="s279">He wouldn't have like it.</span> <span id="s280">Uh...Maybe he wouldn't have minded my knowledge of the music, but he surely would have minded that I'm leaving Yeshiva and go to there to study.</span> <span id="s281">Now in Pressberg there were many smaller congregations, synagogues and they knew that I knew how to .</span> <span id="s282">They invited me.</span> <span id="s283">And this is what I made a living for myself from, and this is what gave me the opportunity financially to travel to Vienna and take some lessons.</span> <span id="s284">So there it started.</span> <span id="s285">One Saturday, when I after the , a man came over to me and told me he is from Vienna.</span> <span id="s286">He works in Vienna.</span> <span id="s287">He's originally from Pressburg, works in Vienna at and is a member of a congregation called Temple.</span> <span id="s288">, and their , a young man just left and he thinks I will be the proper person for them.</span> <span id="s289">Why don't I apply?</span> <span id="s290">So the next time when I went to...uh...Vienna, I applied.</span> <span id="s291">They invited me for a Shavuot ...uh...to perform the services.</span> <span id="s292">I performed the services and I was elected to be their cantor, and was with them for about 3 years, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">After this, there was a written out for...uh.</span> <span id="s294">.</span> <span id="s295">the looked for a cantor for its 21st .</span> <span id="s296">That's a district.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: .</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: The is not as strict as the Budapest because there the Q: Translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Taxes.</span> <span id="s300">The taxes were not collected by the...by the state if the person, let's say a Jew didn't pay to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s301">However, it was extremely well organized and the...the central congre...central congregation let's say had its offices and its administration.</span> <span id="s302">They...uh...they...uh...the nations and the...were always coming in well, and they never had any financial troubles.</span> <span id="s303">There the only thing was...was similar to...to the Hungarian setup was that they also had synagogues for each district, led and controlled by the Central Congregation.</span> <span id="s304">Now when I applied for this...uh...congrega...for this position at the .</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: This is in Vienna.</span> <span id="s307">When I applied, there was to my luck, a person by the name Gross, Mr. Gross, who every year for the needs of his business traveled to the Leipzig international market.</span> <span id="s308">And on his way home to...back to Novi Sad, where he lived, by special permission he listened to the applicants which...uh...were quite a few.</span> <span id="s309">I think a hundred, over a hundred applied, and 16 people were given permission .</span> <span id="s310">In order words, a check...checkup on the person who eventually will get permission to perform a service.</span> <span id="s311">And I was one of them, and this Mr. Gross like me, and went home and because they didn't have a cantor , ...the chief cantor left them....their chief cantor left them a year and a half ago or so.</span> <span id="s312">He went home, give a report and ...uh...I was invited to give a..</span> <span id="s313">.</span> <span id="s314">a..</span> <span id="s315">.</span> <span id="s316">uh...a , a trial performance in Novi Sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: In Novi Sad or .</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: No.</span> <span id="s319">This is already in Novi Sad from...from Vienna.</span> <span id="s320">You see this man, this Mr. Gross was from Novi Sad.</span> <span id="s321">And...uh...I came down, gave the so-called Proba, the trial service and I was elected.</span> <span id="s322">Few...few days later I got a phone call I'm elected.</span> <span id="s323">On the 28th of April 1928, I came down as the elected chief cantor of the congregation in Yugoslavia in the town of Novi Sad.</span> <span id="s324">I lived there and married there...uh...for...I married...I lived there for 6 years.</span> <span id="s325">I had a ...uh...lifetime agreement given to me by that congregation the third or fourth year.</span> <span id="s326">And if you are interested, I will tell you what happened from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s328">Let's go from Novi Sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s330">In Novi Sad I had a magnificent position.</span> <span id="s331">There was one congregation.</span> <span id="s332">No small shuls.</span> <span id="s333">No side temples.</span> <span id="s334">No nothing.</span> <span id="s335">One congregation with 800 Jewish families, an organ, a magnificent choir of 40, a choir leader, an organist.</span> <span id="s336">In other words, the service was organized better than any one or as good as anyone could imagine.</span> <span id="s337">As I say, I served there for 6 years.</span> <span id="s338">Between the 5th and 6th year, I get a letter from a man by the name Mr. from all places in Kovno, from Kovno.</span> <span id="s339">He writes to me and says, namely in the 30s.</span> <span id="s340">This was around the 30s.</span> <span id="s341">I started to give concerts of Jewish content, of synagogue contents, let's say, in the state radio in Belgrade.</span> <span id="s342">And I used to give these concerts and he heard me and said...he wrote in Yiddish that he liked what he heard and he would like to know if I would be willing to come down to that part of the world, Kovno and so on, to give a few concerts.</span> <span id="s343">Money is no problem, and in order to make sure that I understand it money is no problem, he will have in a few days write to me and suggest to me by an official office concert bureau, and this bureau, which is a recognized concert arranger and organizer, will write to me and I should be in contact with them, tell them what I want, and he is backing it, and money is no problem.</span> <span id="s344">I shouldn't forget that.</span> <span id="s345">So when I started to prepare for this road from south...he was from Yugoslavia, which was south, ....uh...to the cold vicinity of Kovno, Russia...former Russia, my own family asked me, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s346">You have the most magnificent position here.</span> <span id="s347">Everyone likes you.</span> <span id="s348">You have no problem.</span> <span id="s349">You make three times as much money as you can spend.</span> <span id="s350">Even your wife is...is engaged by the State.”</span> <span id="s351">She was a school teacher.</span> <span id="s352">"Where are you running?</span> <span id="s353">What are you trying to accomplish?</span> <span id="s354">What are you trying to do?"</span> <span id="s355">However, as a young man...let's not forget, in 1933 I was still only a very young, very, very young man.</span> <span id="s356">And I was interested what's on the other side.</span> <span id="s357">So I went.</span> <span id="s358">And I sanged two Saturdays.</span> <span id="s359">I performed services in Kovno, in the so-called .</span> <span id="s360">That's a big time temple there.</span> <span id="s361">And...uh...I sang twice for the benefit of Yeshivas, Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s362">And all under his guidance.</span> <span id="s363">This man...this Mr. was a millionaire, very rich person, and he had part of his...of his mansions, so to say, advice given to me so that I can study and sing and learn and do whatever I want and he made sure that one of his...uh...uh...carriages...uh... Of course, it was a carriage and horse wagon will take me whenever I have to go to rehearsal, whenever I have to go for a..</span> <span id="s364">.</span> <span id="s365">for a choir practice and so on.</span> <span id="s366">And I was there for about 2 weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Suddenly, and everything was beautiful, very good.</span> <span id="s368">So suddenly, one Shavuot he introduces me to a man by the name Mr. Becker.</span> <span id="s369">Mr. Becker was the President of the in Riga.</span> <span id="s370">And Mr. Becker told me, "They are seeking the services of a Hazan for 2 years already.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">was their cantor before I came there, and they would like very much if I could come over for...to give a audition in the .</span> <span id="s372">I went and performed services and it was left to...rather they had 82 people for... uh...to audition, and they...they were left with three.</span> <span id="s373">One was their former cantor, , who was a great opera singer in his time, and the second was a man by the name who was...came from...uh...from Yohannesburg, and myself.</span> <span id="s374">In Riga, it developed to be a great...uh...a great affair let's say.</span> <span id="s375">There were the , and the , and the .</span> <span id="s376">However, there was a great , the so-called with whom I became very friendly.</span> <span id="s377">And...uh...when these people just couldn't get to first base and many people wanted me and this...uh...the end was told them, "If you want , you'll take Mandel.</span> <span id="s378">If you want opera singer, you take and so on.”</span> <span id="s379">So finally, I was elected in the , and we went there.</span> <span id="s380">And we lived in Riga for 3 years.</span> <span id="s381">As a matter of fact, Manny was born in Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s383">So you are in Riga.</span> <span id="s384">It was 36, 37, early 38.</span> <span id="s385">What was it like.</span> <span id="s386">What were conditions like in Riga at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: This is a very good question.</span> <span id="s388">I will answer it to you.</span> <span id="s389">My answer to my own people who criticize me that I'm leaving Novi Sad was this Mr. Becker took me, showed me Riga.</span> <span id="s390">First of all, he got a magnificent city.</span> <span id="s391">Not that there's anything wrong with Novi Sad, but Riga was a magnificent city.</span> <span id="s392">A tremendously, culturally developed...high culture in every way you can mention.</span> <span id="s393">There was a steady opera.</span> <span id="s394">There were Jewishly spoken.</span> <span id="s395">Mr. Becker took me not only to Yeshivas, but he took me to day schools where the teaching went on from kindergarten on up to university.</span> <span id="s396">Everything was taught in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s397">And these schools were recognized as regular schools and you could go to any university with a diploma from that school, from those schools.</span> <span id="s398">And I said to myself and with my wife, "Look, if we will ever have a child, let me him go to this kind of a school because there is Yiddish and , Jewish...Jewishness and humanism bound together as I have rarely seen it anywhere else.</span> <span id="s399">And this was one of the reasons we went to Riga.</span> <span id="s400">In Riga, we acquired many, many friends...many, many admirers.</span> <span id="s401">However, when...uh...the call came from Budapest that they need a Hazan in Temple, I thought this is still the highest point any cantor can...can look for or wait for, namely Riga itself as beautiful congregation as it was, it wasn't an organized congregation, let's say like Budapest you know where law ruled the congregation, where church and...uh...and faith was...was divided.</span> <span id="s402">So after long, long, long speculation and consideration, we...we decide we both were born in Hungary, spoke Hungarian very well, and...uh...and we decided to leave Riga.</span> <span id="s403">Now, how I came to Budapest is the story...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: We're going to have to condense it.</span> <span id="s405">Can you just tell us about being in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Now, I came to Budapest, and I put it this way.</span> <span id="s407">I came to Budapest in 1936.</span> <span id="s408">I was elected and I did not go back to Riga anymore because I was concerned if I go back, I won't be able to...to leave there.</span> <span id="s409">Because people and I have many, many friends and admirers and so I stayed in Riga...in Budapest, with the excuse that I will start now to rehearse for the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s410">In Budapest, there were two main temples.</span> <span id="s411">One was the traditional where I served, the Temple, and the other was the Temple.</span> <span id="s412">The was bigger, had close to 5,000.</span> <span id="s413">Still stands.</span> <span id="s414">That's the only synagogue which was...remained so-to-say in existence, in comparatively good shape.</span> <span id="s415">And in our...in other words, the Dohine Temple had an organ, had a mixed choir, men and women, and...uh...very fine choir leader.</span> <span id="s416">The was a traditional temple.</span> <span id="s417">In our temple, there were 40 in the choir, men and children, soprano and were sung by children.</span> <span id="s418">Now...uh...I started as I said in 1936 and was in Budapest the chief cantor of the Temple for 10 years.</span> <span id="s419">You have also to know that the Budapest, the Pest because at the time it wasn't Budapest yet.</span> <span id="s420">It was Pest.</span> <span id="s421">And the Pest community had synagogues according to need in every district.</span> <span id="s422">If two were needed, there were two synagogues.</span> <span id="s423">But chief cantors and chief Rabbis were only in the and Temple.</span> <span id="s424">So the Dohime Temple had two chief cantors, and the Temple had two chief cantors.</span> <span id="s425">In the Dohime, there was and in the was Bornstein and Mandel.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Uh...In these congregations, you asked me before if there were many people.</span> <span id="s427">There were so many people, the Temple had about.</span> <span id="s428">.</span> <span id="s429">uh...3,000 seats.</span> <span id="s430">So many people that because it was a narrow street, police had to be brought in every time when we had services in order that when the people leave the synagogue they shouldn't kill each other.</span> <span id="s431">And this I think is a very interesting thing, and I want to include it in this discussion here.</span> <span id="s432">We were down as I have already said, we...I served in.</span> <span id="s433">.</span> <span id="s434">uh...Budapest 10 years, from 1936 to 46.</span> <span id="s435">In 41, I think it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Let's not jump.</span> <span id="s437">Okay.</span> <span id="s438">Let's...Let's try to stay in order here.</span> <span id="s439">Okay?</span> <span id="s440">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s442">Uh...Things began to change.</span> <span id="s443">You were here as the...the chief cantor, but the world around you began to change in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: The first...</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: How did things begin to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: The first and second...uh...Jewish law against the Jews rather.</span> <span id="s449">You know what that means.</span> <span id="s450">Jewish law.</span> <span id="s451">That meant Jews couldn't hold any positions at government.</span> <span id="s452">Jews couldn't later on have even their own business.</span> <span id="s453">Uh...Non-Jews couldn't have been seen by Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s454">Jews couldn't serve as physicians in...in hospital or even have their own office.</span> <span id="s455">This was in...started in 1938 and continued in 1939 and went on to the point when...uh...the German then occupied Hungary finally.</span> <span id="s456">But as far as...uh...the beginning is concerned, it was...when I came to Budapest, I was given working papers, so-called working papers, permission to work as a non-Hungarian citizen in Hungary for...I got permission for 4 years.</span> <span id="s457">In other words, I should have been in good order up until 1940.</span> <span id="s458">But as soon as...after the first High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s459">That means before 1937 already, the French policei.</span> <span id="s460">The ones who controlled the people who...who are not citizen butt in and they made sure that we will be asked to leave Hungary or arrest us.</span> <span id="s461">So that danger was tremendously big and that was the time when I think in 1938 or the beginning of 39, I went to London to try out there.</span> <span id="s462">And I was elected.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">However, I came back to Budapest because 3 days after this...uh...Saturday when I performed services, the President of that congregation, I should have been elected to be the cantor of the Dukes Place Synagogue.</span> <span id="s464">But this wasn't to be because the night after we...we had a meeting with the Board, I got a telegram from Budapest sent to me by Secretary General saying your case is in good order again.</span> <span id="s465">We expect you home lovingly.</span> <span id="s466">So, being that my family was already settled in Budapest and so on, I didn't ask for expenses.</span> <span id="s467">I didn't ask anything.</span> <span id="s468">I ran like crazy and went back and...uh...went back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s469">It seems it's all fate because I could have...I could have just signed the agreement and stayed in London, but no, it wasn't to be.</span> <span id="s470">So I came back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s471">Now, during these terrible years, 38, I was...the first time I was called into labor camp was in 38 or the beginning in 39 because the big trouble really continued, which started as a said before that the doctors couldn't be doctors.</span> <span id="s472">The lawyers could be lawyers.</span> <span id="s473">The professionals couldn't be professionals anymore.</span> <span id="s474">It expanded to the point where me, at the time, yet younger Jews were called into labor camp and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s475">I was called in and...uh...I served for the first time in...not too far from Budapest, in a place Shirastopeck, meaning nothing.</span> <span id="s476">We built airports.</span> <span id="s477">I'm asking you for what.</span> <span id="s478">I don't think an airplane ever... ever appeared there.</span> <span id="s479">But we did.</span> <span id="s480">Just to...to make it hard on us.</span> <span id="s481">And this went on almost to the very end.</span> <span id="s482">The first two years I would say 38, 39 and maybe the beginning of 40.</span> <span id="s483">Yeah.</span> <span id="s484">I was still within the border of Hungary.</span> <span id="s485">I was called in many, many times, but not over...not sent over the border.</span> <span id="s486">Later on...uh...toward the end of the...of the war, we were in Galicea.</span> <span id="s487">We were in Poland.</span> <span id="s488">We were in former Russia up to the Dunn River we went, and that's the way they us and gave us difficulties.</span> <span id="s489">They finally...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: We don't.</span> <span id="s491">.</span> <span id="s492">We want to go to the end.</span> <span id="s493">Okay?</span> <span id="s494">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: The thing I would like to do is (coughing) is to pause here and change tapes and then we go back.</span> <span id="s496">I want to know more about the labor camp.</span> <span id="s497">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s501">We're on.</span> <span id="s502">Yes.</span> <span id="s503">The camera is back on.</span> <span id="s504">Uh...Cantor Mandel, in Budapest around 1941 with all of this happening, what was it like for you, for your family, inside the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: It was terrible and worse yet in other families, but as far as I and we were concerned, I was still employed by the congregation.</span> <span id="s506">I got my monthly check and we could make a living.</span> <span id="s507">However, my mother remained at the time still in that village where I was born.</span> <span id="s508">My father has died already, so I brought her up to...to Budapest and she lived for a very short while in our house and later on, she lived...my brother became a student at the Rabbinical Seminary at the University because that was...uh...the Seminary student had to finish college as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">They had to get a degree from the university.</span> <span id="s510">So in order to save him from labor camp when he came up, I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the Rabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...Seminary.</span> <span id="s511">It was no problem because he had a tremendous amount of Hebrew knowledge.</span> <span id="s512">And...uh...in...uh...1939, 40, even the beginning of 41, if we wanted to get something good, it had to be sent to us from Novi Sad.</span> <span id="s513">For instance, we...we needed some meat for Passover, so my in-laws sent with a cert....by a certain man, who was the superintendent of our buildings in Novi Sad, they sent up...I don't know...geese and whatever we needed.</span> <span id="s514">Uh...Jews...later after the second law again the Jews couldn't go out to the store at any time during the day and buy anything.</span> <span id="s515">They had a certain hour or two...I don't remember exactly...during the day when they could go out.</span> <span id="s516">And of course when they...when they could go out everything was gone.</span> <span id="s517">It was a very, very hard life with a lot of things missing.</span> <span id="s518">We were very lucky because my in-laws who lived in Yugo...in Yugo...again that was formerly Yugoslavia was Hungary again.</span> <span id="s519">They helped us out with many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Now, as far as within the family, everything was fine because we had the...the benefit of the big congregation and everyone knew...uh...who we are and didn't bother us too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">However, when it came to...uh...being a Jew it didn't make any difference when the...when it was handled by the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s522">And so...</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because they were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them where you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen.</span> <span id="s525">Even if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws covered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Now, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this is against the law, that's a terrible, terrible thing.</span> <span id="s527">I did one more thing in Budapest which I probably have never mentioned, but I will mention it now.</span> <span id="s528">This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary General of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the Jew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and organize a district in the 7th district, which didn't exist before.</span> <span id="s529">People were taken up or rather thrown out from their own homes and they were moved together with other people, so there was a big problem.</span> <span id="s530">One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't.</span> <span id="s531">One family had old people; the other had the young people and children.</span> <span id="s532">But they were moved together in apartments, and other apartments were taken away because there were some districts where the Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility for them to live.</span> <span id="s533">Now, I organized the 7th inner district at the time, and made sure that we know who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a kosher home; who doesn't; and so and so that they forced getting together of these families in one apartment instead of three or four was let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't have been available.</span> <span id="s534">And I was the secretary of that 6th...7th district for quite awhile (drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about....</span> <span id="s535">Yeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the ghetto so that the Jews would be together already.</span> <span id="s536">And this was done.</span> <span id="s537">Now what is your next question?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What happened to you as the years progressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: As the years progressed, 1940...Yeah, all the time, starting from 1938, either I was home for 4 weeks and then called back to the labor camp and was there for 2 months let's say.</span> <span id="s540">And I had the congregation force their way through their influences that I was allowed again to come home for let's say the month of the...of the High Holy Days or any holiday or Pesach or Shuef.</span> <span id="s541">So I came home and I stayed home for...for the time I was allowed to stay home...to stay home.</span> <span id="s542">And the winter months as a rule were taken more easy than the summer months.</span> <span id="s543">Summer months we almost constantly were in camp and for the winter months, sometimes we were allowed to...uh...go home and we lived there.</span> <span id="s544">Now what happened for instance, I can tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time.</span> <span id="s545">In 1941, my sister-in-law who lived in Novi Sad, came for a visit to Budapest.</span> <span id="s546">And at the time our son, Emmy...Manny, was a very small child.</span> <span id="s547">He was born in 1936, and this sister-in-law, who loved him with all her heart, she told my wife, her sister, "Look, the child has a cold.</span> <span id="s548">He's coughing and all that.</span> <span id="s549">Novi Sad is still about a l00 kilometer south.</span> <span id="s550">I will take him down.</span> <span id="s551">Maybe his cough with subside easier there.”</span> <span id="s552">So we went with her and...uh...I made arrangements because there were two chief cantors in Temple that my colleague who was with me will take over all my duties for Sunday.</span> <span id="s553">There were many, many weddings and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s554">He will take over, and I will take over for him the next time when it's his next.</span> <span id="s555">So we went down to Novi Sad on Thursday and stayed with this sister-in-law in her apartment and Friday morning before...at dawn, my father-in-law, who lived close by, came over to his daughter, to us, to tell her, tell us, inform us that there is a pogrom outside and the Jews and are picked up and congregated somewhere.</span> <span id="s556">So it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s557">That was a Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">We...we waited in the house.</span> <span id="s559">About ll:00 the gendarme with full glairy, fixed up with his machine gun and all that came to take us to a certain spot where the Jews were con...were gathered, and from there they were marched down to the Danube.</span> <span id="s560">We didn't know that this will happen, but this is what it was.</span> <span id="s561">The Jew...the and the Jews were down...were taken down to the Danube River.</span> <span id="s562">The Danube River was frozen maybe...I don't know how many inches thick, but they...they threw some...uh...material, some military bomb or something into the water, probed the....uh...the thing open...ice, the ice open and took the people into a place where they had to undress and naked to go on the trampoline which was over the Danube River, and they were shot into the River.</span> <span id="s563">They were shot and fell into the River.</span> <span id="s564">Now, this went on for a long time.</span> <span id="s565">We saw trucks arriving there with and Jewish people and they were all put into a line.</span> <span id="s566">I think a line of two and there was always a gendarme or a policeman who was told and informed by the government that all these people who are being...who are being taken here are being taken here because they are the enemies of Hungary.</span> <span id="s567">The really...the newly occu...back occupied Hungary because you know that was Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s568">It was Hungary, then Yugoslavia, then the Hungarians occupied it again.</span> <span id="s569">So when our next came, before us was standing the owner of the house...uh... where my sister- in-law lived.</span> <span id="s570">When our next came, the policeman came over.</span> <span id="s571">I was holding Manny in my coat, in my fur coat because he...he had fever, and...uh...he took a look at me and said...uh..."What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s572">Chief Cantor, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s573">You are not a Czechnik?"</span> <span id="s574">Czechnik meant the...the people who hated Hungary.</span> <span id="s575">The serp people and others who hated Hungary.</span> <span id="s576">You are no Czechnik.</span> <span id="s577">And he was all terribly excited, and ran over to the Lieutenant who was there was in charge and told him, "The...the Chief Cantor from the is here.</span> <span id="s578">He's...he's not a cheknik.</span> <span id="s579">He's...I know him, and I 'm there many times."</span> <span id="s580">Namely, as I told you before, the Temple was a very narrow street and because people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so he was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman.</span> <span id="s581">So he knew me very well.</span> <span id="s582">And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or fourth try, the lieutenant told him, "Put him aside.</span> <span id="s583">Stand him...let him stand aside.”</span> <span id="s584">This saved our lives because Hortee (pause - drinking water) Hortee then called off the killing, and this is when it stopped at our .</span> <span id="s585">So if anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't believe it, but it's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Can you go back to that scene with these people at the River?</span> <span id="s587">Tell me what it was like, what you saw, and what you were like.</span> <span id="s588">What was the scene like at the River?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: The scene was...the scene was 29 degrees celsius.</span> <span id="s590">People were crying, and when we heard tut, tut, tut, tut, another few shots, we...we knew what's happening.</span> <span id="s591">We imagined what's happening.</span> <span id="s592">And people were crying and hollering and...and throwing themselves to the floor, to the ground and as...as...as...as can well be imagined what happened.</span> <span id="s593">But before we should have gone in and be the next ones to be killed, the killing stopped.</span> <span id="s594">From there, we were taken into a..</span> <span id="s595">.</span> <span id="s596">into a gymnasium...uh...walked back and...uh...when we spoke about where we are going and...and what happened, the...uh....one of the policeman was walking along side with us told me, "You are very lucky people.</span> <span id="s597">I don't know if you know what's happened inside the they called it.</span> <span id="s598">It was a bathing stop at the Danube in Novi Sad all the time, and then it became the killing spot.</span> <span id="s599">So he said, "You are very lucky people.</span> <span id="s600">You don't know....do you know what happened inside?"</span> <span id="s601">And...uh...he told us the story.</span> <span id="s602">It was Friday afternoon when we arrived to this gymnasium where we were held...uh...for a couple of hours and told that now we are clear...we are in the clear.</span> <span id="s603">Everything is fine because it was proved that we are not chekniks.</span> <span id="s604">And then we went home to our apartment and, of course, as you...we didn't stay.</span> <span id="s605">Saturday evening we went home, back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s606">In Budapest, it was...this kind of thing at the time did not happen yet.</span> <span id="s607">41.</span> <span id="s608">It happened many times after that in 42 and 43 when groups of 50 and...and maybe hundred were gathered and were taken to the Danube River by 10 or 12 and shot into the River.</span> <span id="s609">This happened.</span> <span id="s610">Later on, this became a daily occurrence in 43 and...uh...and 44.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Did you see some of these roundups?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: The roundups I did see because even from the place where I stayed... My family wasn't with me at the time.</span> <span id="s613">They were in Bergen-Belsen at the time because...uh...there was... uh...an effort to save some people, and there were sixteen hundred and some people...Jews who were transported from Budapest to...uh...through...through different stops, but finally they got to Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s614">This was a Catholic group if you know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s616">I would like you to pause.</span> <span id="s617">I would like you to tell us the story of how your family became part of the group that went to Bergen Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Now, my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen, the Kosner group as they called it...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew that so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the time...I was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said, "Though (that's my Hungarian name) isn't home, we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son, Emmy, and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical student he was not taken into...into labor camp.</span> <span id="s619">So he was extremely active.</span> <span id="s620">He probably had something to do with it to...to bring it to the attention of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: You would have been in the Ukraine in labor camps?</span> <span id="s622">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: In labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Labor camps.</span> <span id="s625">And my family was...was in Budapest.</span> <span id="s626">So they were taken with the Kosner group.</span> <span id="s627">First it was that they go straight to Israel, then it was said the...as I hear now from people who were part of the group...uh...they were...they were supposed to go to Auschwitz and finally, they made up to go to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: How did you find out that your family had been taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: I did not find out...uh...until I didn't come back...until I didn't escape in...uh...November, the end of November.</span> <span id="s630">In , I left the company, company, and we walked mainly nighttimes...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s632">I'm confused.</span> <span id="s633">Could we stop?</span> <span id="s634">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s635">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: You are in which town where?</span> <span id="s637">You are in where?</span> <span id="s638">A: Now, you have to understand what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: As the Germans got...got...as...the Russians performed their attacks against the Germans pushing them from east to west, so the labor camp people...the labor camp laborers, Jews, were always pushed together with them.</span> <span id="s641">Why?</span> <span id="s642">Because the Germans and even the Hungarians had a tremendous amount of food and other necessities in different places and we had to hurry up and load the wagons and...and trains for them that their material should be taken...uh...westwards instead of being taken by the Russians.</span> <span id="s643">So we moved always with this ...with this attack.</span> <span id="s644">(Cough) And finally, when we got to ShotroyRehe, I heard that....at ShotroyRehe, there is an organization (coughing - drinking water) which takes the Jews in the direction of Vienna they told us at the time and whoever cannot walk is shot.</span> <span id="s645">So I spoke to a few people who I could reach and told them I am doing this.</span> <span id="s646">If you want to come with me, maybe a great risk but this is what I will do.</span> <span id="s647">And that must have been the beginning of November.</span> <span id="s648">When we were already pushed back to the point of...uh...my birthday's let's say...or...or</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: November of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: November of 1944.</span> <span id="s651">And so we left the company and tried to get in the direction of Budapest and it took about 10 or 12 or 14 days until we accomplished our goal to get to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Could you tell me...Really, I would like to know how you got away from the camp and what that walk was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: The...the getting away from the camp was simply take a risk every second of the...of that time to be shot by a Hungarian Nazi.</span> <span id="s654">Not necessarily a..</span> <span id="s655">.</span> <span id="s656">a man, but a 12, 13 year old boy who had a gun and if he shot a Jew, they probably gave him a thank you.</span> <span id="s657">Not...uh....he didn't...he wasn't exposed to any punishment or anything of that.</span> <span id="s658">And this is the way we got away.</span> <span id="s659">We just slipped away, left everything what we had, and had the same clothes and the same shoes, maybe sometimes without soles, but we...we went in the direction of Budapest because we thought there is the revenge.</span> <span id="s660">I remember walking through a town immediately...uh...the...at the border of Budapest where there were Hungarian papers who said THE FALL OF BUDAPEST IS EXPECTED ANY HOUR.</span> <span id="s661">THE RUSSIANS ARE HERE AND THERE IN THIS AND THIS SPOT.</span> <span id="s662">And when I came to Budapest the ghetto, of course was...I..</span> <span id="s663">.</span> <span id="s664">we...we didn't know that there was a ghetto in Budapest.</span> <span id="s665">The ghetto was already working.</span> <span id="s666">The Jews were already concentrated in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s667">As I heard later, the Germans have prepared to...uh...to put some bombs in the ghetto and...and to kill all the Jews who are there, but this didn't happen and when I arrived in...uh... Budapest the 17th of November, I took my life....</span> <span id="s668">I knew already that my family is in Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Because my...the place where we lived was part of the ghetto, and a friend of mine who lived in one of the so-called...uh...houses which were...which were not... which were except...an exception and not ghetto...how did they call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Protected house?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Protective house.</span> <span id="s673">Uh...He told me that my family went with this and group to the Kosner group and he doesn't know where they are now, but they are not home.</span> <span id="s674">Ella and the child and another...uh...relative's child of ours went with my brother and my wife to...with...with the Kosner group.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Tell us what you....</span> <span id="s676">You can slow down.</span> <span id="s677">Please.</span> <span id="s678">Tell us what your reaction was when you heard this news.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: My reaction was...first, I will...I will...I'll start at the first reaction which I got when I arrived and I took my life into my life into my hand because you couldn't walk into the ghetto and walk out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s680">So we were about...I was about 2 blocks let's say from the place where our apartment was and I at one...one early morning, as I have said, took my life into my hands and through all kinds of machinations, I got to the place where our apartment...the house where our apartment was.</span> <span id="s681">Our apartment was on the top floor, magnificent apartment, with Persian rugs and pictures and this and that.</span> <span id="s682">And every piece of furniture in that apartment was done by the...by the meister, you know.</span> <span id="s683">And when I came in through the bombings and so on, snow...this was the top apartment.</span> <span id="s684">Snow was falling in...uh ...very freely on the rugs.</span> <span id="s685">And the...the where we had our dishes, let's say, which Rosenthal dishes, there were pieces on the floor because a bomb hit it.</span> <span id="s686">And.</span> <span id="s687">.</span> <span id="s688">uh...I was told that...that...uh...uh...80...80 some people are living in our apartment.</span> <span id="s689">At the time when I came into the apartment, it was not locked and I could in...could get in to the apartment, and I saw there is no roof.</span> <span id="s690">There is no...nothing.</span> <span id="s691">Now, this was the first impression.</span> <span id="s692">The family isn't there.</span> <span id="s693">This is the picture I found, so if I didn't get a heart attack there, right then and there, it is just by...by the grace of God.</span> <span id="s694">From there, I went back to this friend who told me about my family with the Kosner, Kosner group and we started to speculate, "What can I do?"</span> <span id="s695">So I, at the time I was quite young yet and my face was full and I looked like a real peasant so the idea was by the people who led this rescue mission there, that the best thing for me would be to pose as a non-Jew who was on the front and came home now...uh...because of...uh...he got hurt and was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s696">And of course, I got papers for all this because the...our...our machinery worked perfectly to make any kind of false papers.</span> <span id="s697">And I got those papers.</span> <span id="s698">I was called a runner.</span> <span id="s699">What was the runner?</span> <span id="s700">Uh...The Schutzpass business started.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Was already on at the time when I came home, when I arrived home in 1944...uh...November, December, so the... the request to me was made.</span> <span id="s702">I should be a runner for that commission about whom no one knew, at least we thought so, and they will give me papers as a Goy who was...who was injured on the frontline and came home and now I'm here on...uh...rehabilitation and spend the time in Budapest.</span> <span id="s703">The assignment really was to go to the...the...uh... Swedish man, Raul...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s706">To the Wallenberg offices, get the Schutzpasses, be told where they have to be taken because they were in contact, and I as a Hungarian soldier can walk on the street freely...uh...I..</span> <span id="s707">.</span> <span id="s708">it wasn't so, but...but that's the way it was planned and I should take these Schutzpasses to the different spots where they are needed.</span> <span id="s709">This was my work after I came back from...from labor camp let's say.</span> <span id="s710">Many times I did something else.</span> <span id="s711">People were by the hundreds maybe thousands gathered in the concentration prison.</span> <span id="s712">There was such a thing in Pest, and there they were not only mishandled and so on, but many, many terrible things happened to them.</span> <span id="s713">Once we were told that in the Tolence house, that's the place from where they are thrown over the border, there...I don't know how many people...and we...the people who were assigned for this mission, dressed up in Hungarian gendarme uniforms and went to the place where they were gathered.</span> <span id="s714">This is in this case the Tolance house prison.</span> <span id="s715">And we cursed them and we said the worse things about the Jews and so, but we took I don't know maybe 50 or 60 Jews, and we had machine guns and and we...we ...we got them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">The got them out by false papers, of course, that we will take care of them.</span> <span id="s717">We are Hungarian gendarme , and we will take care of them.</span> <span id="s718">We'll...we'll... .</span> <span id="s719">And so they were given to us and we marched them back to different spots, different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">These...uh...houses which were...uh...saved I'd say or posted as non- as non .</span> <span id="s721">And this is...this is...between these two occupations, there didn't remain too much time too...uh...you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Can you...did you ever meet Raul Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yes, I met him many times.</span> <span id="s724">But I..</span> <span id="s725">.</span> <span id="s726">I never had a chance to sit down with him for 5 minutes because as...even if he was in the office when I came there and there was not one of us...he was in different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: You're talking about Raoul?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s729">Yes.</span> <span id="s730">He was there and he saw me and secretaries and so on knew who I am and they told him.</span> <span id="s731">And he said...he spoke German there.</span> <span id="s732">He said, "Give him...Give him whatever he has to get fast.</span> <span id="s733">Let him go because every minute is a loss.”</span> <span id="s734">And they...they used to give me the papers, these Schutzpasses, big pieces of paper.</span> <span id="s735">They looked beautiful falsifications.</span> <span id="s736">And I used to , so I..</span> <span id="s737">.</span> <span id="s738">his...there I had an interview with some people from...from one of the Scandinavian universities whom I don't remember anymore.</span> <span id="s739">Time ago.</span> <span id="s740">And...uh...he asked me, "Tell me the most important thing you can...you can think about when you think of Wallenberg.”</span> <span id="s741">So I told him, "You know what it is.</span> <span id="s742">My sadness that I never had a chance to sit down with this angelic person to...to talk to him for 5 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: What was the scene like inside the Wallenberg offices?</span> <span id="s744">Was this in the Consulate or was this elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s746">There...there...there were offices, official offices where only the Consulate or close by.</span> <span id="s747">They occupied another room or something.</span> <span id="s748">They did the best they could.</span> <span id="s749">There wasn't you go out and rent an apartment or rent an office.</span> <span id="s750">They did it the best they could.</span> <span id="s751">The official business was always handled from the Consulate itself.</span> <span id="s752">The non-officials, the falsifications, the printing jobs, the...the military there, what...what we used...uh...I don't know...uniforms, guns, and so on, they were kept somewhere else.</span> <span id="s753">And meetings were always in...never in the Consulates of course.</span> <span id="s754">They were in these private places.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Did you meet other people connected with Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Only my own kind because many people did one thing or another for...for the...for the cause.</span> <span id="s757">There was a Dr. who worked very closely with...he was one of the Rabbis in Budapest at the time.</span> <span id="s758">Very closely, Dr. and others and...and my kind who either went in because they really were excellently qualified to do the administration or they came in on a basis like myself.</span> <span id="s759">And what myself is I don't want to prepare you.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Can you describe to us...take us through one of those courier runs, from the time when you went in to pick up the Schutzpass to when you dropped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Now, I was at the time, of course, not in my house because I was never in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s762">In one of the...one of the houses, you mentioned before the name...</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Protected house?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Protected houses and the protection, the little Nazi, Hungarian Nazi, came in and commanded everyone down.</span> <span id="s765">And whoever he wanted, he took and said, "They'll be back.</span> <span id="s766">They'll be back.”</span> <span id="s767">He took them.</span> <span id="s768">They never came back.</span> <span id="s769">So this was the story.</span> <span id="s770">Uh...So I got dressed and tried very carefully to leave the protected house so that no one would see me and I got, let's say, to a..</span> <span id="s771">.</span> <span id="s772">to a Consulate, a Swedish Consulate which was in Buda and there...I got there.</span> <span id="s773">I never remember to have to wait because all the officials, all the workers there were told not to delay, not to delay.</span> <span id="s774">First of all, in some cases the Schutzpasses were respected, you know, and if...uh...a call came by any Nazi, they show them the Schutzpass, he respected it in case...in some cases, or rather in many cases.</span> <span id="s775">Now, I got there.</span> <span id="s776">Of course, I had to walk because at the time there was no more...uh...uh...street car or any...any communication, anything.</span> <span id="s777">So I walked to the place.</span> <span id="s778">I tried very hard no one shall see me when I leave the Consulate.</span> <span id="s779">Uh...Sometimes I succeeded, sometimes no.</span> <span id="s780">Sometimes, I met...uh...people who...who were Nazis and we had a discussion like, "Aw, those terrible Jews, what they did here," and because I spoke the language fluently in many cases, this helped me.</span> <span id="s781">And I tried to get back as soon as I delivered what I have to deliver to get back to the protected house.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">And I waited until I got a..</span> <span id="s783">.</span> <span id="s784">the next command to go either to free Jews from the...uh...from the Tolance house which is the the last stop before they are shot in the Danube or.</span> <span id="s785">.</span> <span id="s786">or do something else, whatever I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Will you know take us through one of those trips where you freed Jews from the Tolance house and tell us what that scene was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: The scene was 10 or 12 Jews, strong, young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s790">Repeat...repeat questions so the camera knows where you are.</span> <span id="s791">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: You were asked where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: In Budapest.</span> <span id="s794">And...uh...they...our administration knew very well who they have, and people who they could count on.</span> <span id="s795">In other words, they were really not broken down old people or ...or young people who can't move.</span> <span id="s796">They were people who were strength and energy and they...they knew if they will be dressed up as gendarmes, they will be gendarmes.</span> <span id="s797">They will act as gendarmes.</span> <span id="s798">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: The Tolence house now.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s801">Now, so when we got the command, let's say to go free these people in the Tolence house we got dressed and got together at a certain spot, wherever we were told.</span> <span id="s802">On a street corner because we...we weren't Jews.</span> <span id="s803">You know, we were...we were...uh...Christians and...uh...we got together wherever we told and from there under the direction of the one who was assigned to be the...the officer, the commander of this group and who was dressed up as a..</span> <span id="s804">.</span> <span id="s805">a lieutenant or something like that, he...we went in marched form up the place where we had to do the job.</span> <span id="s806">And when we got there, the man took the paper and showed it to...to whoever it was in charge there and told him we will take these damn Jews and do the right thing with them.</span> <span id="s807">Don't worry Comrade.</span> <span id="s808">Just give them to us.</span> <span id="s809">So...uh...if there were 20 or 50 or...or whatever amount of people, we took them and while we...and as soon as we got out of the...of the Tolence house which was, of course, protected by all kinds of gates and what not, as soon as we felt that we can tell the people, we marched close by to them, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s810">This is...this is just a play.</span> <span id="s811">You will be saved.</span> <span id="s812">We take you to this and this place, and we came here.</span> <span id="s813">We are Jews and we will...we will ...we won't kill you.</span> <span id="s814">You...we take you where you should be.”</span> <span id="s815">And so the people quieted down and they...they came with us and marched with us, and we took them wherever they...we were told to take this.</span> <span id="s816">This is...this was the scene.</span> <span id="s817">Uh...You have to know that in those days the streets of Budapest were completely empty.</span> <span id="s818">There was very little ...uh...uh...cars, very few cars.</span> <span id="s819">Anyhow, but there...there was no...no...no communication.</span> <span id="s820">People didn't walk on the street.</span> <span id="s821">They simply were scared, let along...I mean like cars or something like that.</span> <span id="s822">You very very rarely that you saw that at the time.</span> <span id="s823">First of all, most of the vehicles were taken by the...by the military, and second of all, who dared to go to the street?</span> <span id="s824">I mean there was bombing going on and...and what not, so they were just scared.</span> <span id="s825">Uh...Jews, of course, didn't dare to go out, and other people were scared too.</span> <span id="s826">So we could...uh...we could very well do our stick, whatever we had to do there.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What other kinds of things did you do with the underground?</span> <span id="s828">This was with the Zionist underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s830">With the Zionist underground.</span> <span id="s831">What other things?</span> <span id="s832">I stayed in...uh...we had to be...we had to bring...and we had to bring in paper and we had to...any kind of thing, whatever there was to be done.</span> <span id="s833">There was no such a thing like...we didn't have any water in the last times already because the water was cut off.</span> <span id="s834">So I stayed with a..</span> <span id="s835">.</span> <span id="s836">with a dish and waited until I got enough water to bring it up to make a tea or.</span> <span id="s837">.</span> <span id="s838">or boil it to some soup with...with something in it or...or bring it to an old person, an elderly person or a sick person.</span> <span id="s839">Give them a drink of water.</span> <span id="s840">That was one of the jobs we had to do.</span> <span id="s841">And it wasn't only myself.</span> <span id="s842">Many people...uh...did the same thing.</span> <span id="s843">We went down to the cellar where a little bit of pressure was still on, and gathered the water from the pipes which were in the cellar and so we took it up to the 4th, 5th floor for...to be used for...for whatever it is needed.</span> <span id="s844">And that went for...for bread and for cheese and for...for...for whatever we could put our hands on.</span> <span id="s845">Now, I had to go out and let's say bring back some bread.</span> <span id="s846">So I knew where the bakeries are for I live in Budapest.</span> <span id="s847">And...uh...so I went there, and if I got some bread I had a..</span> <span id="s848">.</span> <span id="s849">uh...coat, a white coat.</span> <span id="s850">I put my...I put...I'll never forget that...that was a specialty...have a bag, put my hand into the suits there.</span> <span id="s851">It's in my pocket, but actually I was holding the bread underneath my coat, and I walked home.</span> <span id="s852">Now, you know, the...this kind of terrible, terrible experience teaches people to do many, many things which you never thought you are able to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: The...the winter of 44, I gather, was very cold.</span> <span id="s854">Will you tell me about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Terribly cold.</span> <span id="s856">Terribly cold.</span> <span id="s857">The main thing I can tell you is...then I have to flash back to...uh...uh...Novi Sad.</span> <span id="s858">It was 28 below celsius, is...that would be about 50 something like that.</span> <span id="s859">And while we were, let's say, in ...uh...in...in Budapest during 44 and so, we were very young and we could stand it.</span> <span id="s860">And then we had very good training in Russia and with the Ukraine where we were in labor camp to get used to these things.</span> <span id="s861">Sometimes, the snow was a meter or meter and half tall or high, and people slept on...in the snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: They slept in the snow?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: In the snow.</span> <span id="s864">Yes.</span> <span id="s865">Put on their coat.</span> <span id="s866">Crawled into the...in the snow and the snow kept them warm.</span> <span id="s867">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: In that winter of 44... A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: 44, early 45, who were your friends in the underground that were doing the same things you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: As I told you, there was this Haskowich, who was one of my best friends.</span> <span id="s871">He was a brother of a colleague of mine.</span> <span id="s872">And ...uh...he...he gave me the first information about my family.</span> <span id="s873">Of course, I tried to get to Kosner.</span> <span id="s874">I had difficulties to get in.</span> <span id="s875">He was an extremely busy person, but finally I got to him and found out that my family is still not in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s876">They are still in...uh...in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s877">Uh...During this...uh...1944, after January...I don't remember, probably the 18th of January, when Russian soldier appeared in the cellar of that house where we were, we knew that every minute, every hour is danger.</span> <span id="s878">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s879">When this Russian soldier arrived, we thought we are freed, but it wasn't like that.</span> <span id="s880">The Russians just didn't...didn't just redeem us.</span> <span id="s881">They brought all kinds of problems.</span> <span id="s882">I..</span> <span id="s883">.</span> <span id="s884">you probably know about that.</span> <span id="s885">Uh...There's a story in that.</span> <span id="s886">And there were cases where soldiers carried 15 and 18 watches and put them on their arm, and is a very well know phrase known to everybody.</span> <span id="s887">"Give the...Give the...Give me your watch.”</span> <span id="s888">It was a hard, hard, hard life, but...uh...when it came we tried to get back to our own homes, and I went back to my home after...after a certain while.</span> <span id="s889">I didn't leave Hungary until 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Let's stop a minute.</span> <span id="s891">You gave...when the Russians came in, you eventually got back to your apartment.</span> <span id="s892">What about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: My family was still not there.</span> <span id="s894">My wife never, never wanted to get back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s895">She was so hurt in her...in her personality, in her humanness so to say, that she never wanted to step on the ground of Hungary anymore.</span> <span id="s896">I remember when we took our first trip to...uh...Israel, we had to...she still had...at the time, she had an aunt who she liked very much in Budapest.</span> <span id="s897">And we had to wait a day and a half in Vienna for the airplane for...for the plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s899">I'm confused.</span> <span id="s900">I..</span> <span id="s901">.</span> <span id="s902">I need some order here.</span> <span id="s903">You are in Budapest.</span> <span id="s904">You find out about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Family.</span> <span id="s906">I write to them.</span> <span id="s907">I write to them.</span> <span id="s908">I try to get...uh...get them to phone.</span> <span id="s909">There was no phone, of course.</span> <span id="s910">One letter after another.</span> <span id="s911">Finally, I got a letter from my wife saying she does not want to come back to Budapest where I have magnificent...uh...prospects in Budapest because (clearing throat) I kept my position.</span> <span id="s912">Though our, my Temple, was used as the ghetto...uh... the...uh...actually, they had no...in that vicinity where...where the ghetto was, originally, they had no hospitals.</span> <span id="s913">So they organized a ghetto hospital so to say in my Temple.</span> <span id="s914">And.</span> <span id="s915">.</span> <span id="s916">uh...this place...I don't have to tell you how it was by the time the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s917">All dirt and all smut and all...all this.</span> <span id="s918">So I organized (clearing throat - drinking water) and as I have said, we were freed, liberated about the 18th of January or sometime in that...that period of time and...uh...my birthday is on the 3rd of March.</span> <span id="s919">And while we were in labor camp, I always tried to keep our people warm and together.</span> <span id="s920">Speak to them, tell them things.</span> <span id="s921">I mean bring a little bit of...uh... , of humanity.</span> <span id="s922">And...uh...they remembered that, my comrades, and...uh...said...what...bread for instance was impossible to get and other things, and they asked me what would I want for...for birthday present.</span> <span id="s923">So I told them (cough) about 10, 15 people.</span> <span id="s924">You know what I want.</span> <span id="s925">You become for a day or two or three again a laborer.</span> <span id="s926">Come here with a pick and shovel and let's clean up the Temple.</span> <span id="s927">So the...the...the...uh...back yard and the yard and the front was cleaned at least to the degree that you could walk.</span> <span id="s928">It wasn't all...all dirt and...uh...I organized the rebuilding committee, and rebuilt the Temple, the part of the part of the Temple which was ruined.</span> <span id="s929">This was what I did after the...after the liberation.</span> <span id="s930">Between the...so that on the High Holy Days, we already went back to the Temple as a Temple and had services in the Temple, though there wasn't a seat left or so.</span> <span id="s931">But temporarily it was...it was fixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Tell us about finding your family.</span> <span id="s933">The time is short.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Now finding the family was this.</span> <span id="s935">As I wrote from time to time and didn't get answers, finally I got an answer.</span> <span id="s936">This letter that I told you about before.</span> <span id="s937">I knew...finally, I had to realize in spite of the wonderful prospects I have in Budapest where I could keep my position.</span> <span id="s938">I could become the Secretary General of the Jewish Chaplaincy Service in Budapest because Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Heroshi was the Chief Chaplain and he begged me to...to be his assistant.</span> <span id="s940">I cannot wait or I cannot hope my family should ever come...come back.</span> <span id="s941">So... uh...my first...uh...my last...uh...cable or was it a letter, I don't remember...reached already my family in Bari, Italy, on the way to Israel.</span> <span id="s942">So that my wife who was a teacher by profession went to Israel.</span> <span id="s943">She had a very dear friend, her classmate from first grade, who was a lawyer in Israel, very respected lawyer.</span> <span id="s944">And when they spoke about what she should do...is to go to a kibbutz or take courses and...uh...become a teacher in Israel.</span> <span id="s945">She knew Hebrew quite well.</span> <span id="s946">Uh...The decision finally was made, "No, she should go to a kibbutz with the children.</span> <span id="s947">So, they went to Sharharmikim, where she became a worker, a laborer there first, and later on she became the main.</span> <span id="s948">.</span> <span id="s949">uh...the chief...uh...the chief cook of the kibbutz and I must tell you her food was...what she cooked was extraordinary.</span> <span id="s950">And this is the way then finally I took 3 months of absence, of vacation to find my family.</span> <span id="s951">I knew where they are, and I knew I will never come back to Budapest and I started out to Budapest.</span> <span id="s952">Maybe here's another interesting point.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">When I started out and the congregation this time already, the gave me permission for 3 months to...to for a leave of 3 months.</span> <span id="s954">The organization which took care of people to get them back to their homes made...and many, many people waned to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s955">At the time it was the...the pressure was great for people to get to Israel.</span> <span id="s956">So...and from Hungary, you couldn't just go to Israel.</span> <span id="s957">You had to have special permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s959">We...we need...we have very little time.</span> <span id="s960">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: So if you could just tell us about coming to Israel and finding your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: This is exactly what I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s963">Uh...So I went...80 people.</span> <span id="s964">The story about them was that they were so badly beaten up by the Germans that they lost their hearing and they were all...they were not able to talk.</span> <span id="s965">So I was there commander and so we went through Yugoslavia, through...uh...through Zaga and other places to Italy.</span> <span id="s966">There were all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s967">In Zaga, we had a man who kept up this finger and had a..</span> <span id="s968">.</span> <span id="s969">something...uh... piece of material on it, and we had just to follow him for the one night we spent there.</span> <span id="s970">Then we got to...to...uh... to Italy and the final thing was that we got to preparatory to boarding the boat to Israel.</span> <span id="s971">We got to a place called Statsia, a little fishing village in Italy.</span> <span id="s972">There the English made the Italian government, the Italian forces to arrest us and we spent in Statsia about 9 weeks or 10 weeks.</span> <span id="s973">It was about Pesach time.</span> <span id="s974">I performed Seder services there I remember.</span> <span id="s975">Finally, Morrison, who was the Secretary of Labor in the English government and a Jew, came down to us and tried...Yeah...we...we...to convince us we shouldn't have a hunger strike and we shouldn't do this and that, and I wrote especially hymn for the Holy Pesach there and...uh.</span> <span id="s976">.</span> <span id="s977">and that c'est l'appell was everyday and everyone came out and we had a hunger strike for 98 hours.</span> <span id="s978">Then he came and convinced us we should stop the strike, the...the hunger strike, and really we did stop and we got permits to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s979">So that to Israel, I arrived legally as a legal immigrant.</span> <span id="s980">And there...uh...my wife was waiting for me, but we didn't meet at the boat.</span> <span id="s981">Why not?</span> <span id="s982">Because I was appointed to be the commander of that boat where , and the commander is not allowed to leave the boat until everybody and everything what...what they brought is taken off the boat.</span> <span id="s983">And I had...I had to wait.</span> <span id="s984">And my wife was the kibbutz .</span> <span id="s985">He brought her, and he said, "Look, it's ridiculous.</span> <span id="s986">Why shall we wait.</span> <span id="s987">probably didn't arrive.”</span> <span id="s988">I didn't arrive and I did arrive and went down the boat, left the boat and there was a taxi driver.</span> <span id="s989">I had one English pound in my pocket and I told him, "Look, I have this and this is all I have.</span> <span id="s990">I'll give you this.</span> <span id="s991">Take me to Sharharmiking where my family is and my wife is.”</span> <span id="s992">So he said, "Put it away.</span> <span id="s993">I will take you to Sharharmiking for nothing.”</span> <span id="s994">And so I traveled for the first time to Sharharmiking, where I asked for...for my wife's Hebrew name is .</span> <span id="s995">I thought she's in Israel.</span> <span id="s996">Probably she took the name back.</span> <span id="s997">So they told me, "We have no .”</span> <span id="s998">Who do you have?</span> <span id="s999">We have Ella Mandel.</span> <span id="s1000">She kept her regular name.</span> <span id="s1001">So finally, we met and I don't have to tell you what that...what that meant to all of us.</span> <span id="s1002">She lived in a little hut there, but it wasn't too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: We need to cut this.</span> <span id="s1004">Could you just tell us when you came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1005">You and Ella stayed in Israel how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: We stayed in Israel...I stayed for 19 months.</span> <span id="s1007">Ella stayed for a longer time, probably 3, 4 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: And when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I came to the United States in 1948, March, and my family...is it 1940.....yes, I think it was 1948, March.</span> <span id="s1010">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: And your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: About a year later, a few months and a year later.</span> <span id="s1013">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1014">Cantor Mandel.</span> <span id="s1015">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: You are more than welcome.</span> <span id="s1017">If I added something worthwhile, it's my pleasure.</span> <span id="s1018">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1019">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
