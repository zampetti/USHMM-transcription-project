maiden name used to be Bienstock.</span> <span id="s5">In Poland it was Irena Bienstock.</span> <span id="s6">I was born on May 3, 1931 in a small town in Poland.</span> <span id="s7">The town was called Drohobycz.</span> <span id="s8">I had a very nice childhood until the war.</span> <span id="s9">I grew up as the youngest of three children of Izrael and Ewa Bienstock.</span> <span id="s10">My father was in thread?</span> <span id="s11">business.</span> <span id="s12">He was a very prosperous businessman who was quite known in the town, who had many friends.</span> <span id="s13">I don’t say it was a poor family and it was very privileged, rich life.</span> <span id="s14">I am here to tell you my story because I feel I owe it to Frania Osobkowa.</span> <span id="s15">Her maiden name was Babecka.</span> <span id="s16">She was a very proud Polak, a Polish woman, very devout Catholic, the most beautiful human being I have seen in my life, good and selfless and helpful and it is her that I am thankful, that it is for her that I am here today to tell my story.</span> <span id="s17">Frania worked in our house as a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s18">My mother hired her when she was very young and she came to work for us before I was born.</span> <span id="s19">She took care of my older brother, of my sister and then eventually with me.</span> <span id="s20">It’s time to say that at the beginning she didn’t like me because she resented having to take care of three children.</span> <span id="s21">She knew all her friends had only two children to take care of and here she is, stuck with three children.</span> <span id="s22">My mother understood that she was very devoted to us so my mother didn’t want to lose her and after a time she hired somebody else to take care of me.</span> <span id="s23">But after a while she got very careless and we never could have anybody, and Frania, of course, she was not educated, she didn’t know how to write or to read.</span> <span id="s24">She was a very intelligent woman and today when I see the children are insecure and have to go to psychologists, I am thinking how lucky I was to be brought up by a woman who had so much common sense that we never had any security problems.</span> <span id="s25">We always believed that we were the best, smartest and most beautiful.</span> <span id="s26">Frania believed this and she instilled it in us.</span> <span id="s27">And I am very grateful to her for many, many things in my life.</span> <span id="s28">During the war, we were not, in the beginning, we were not really touched with that.</span> <span id="s29">She was already a mature woman and she lived outside of our house.</span> <span id="s30">Her husband went to war and she did not have any children and she was working menial work in a factory and when the time came that my parents saw that there was absolutely no way for me to survive, that as a last resort, they sent somebody ahead and asked her if she could help out.</span> <span id="s31">And she said, “Naturally, I expect to take care of them.</span> <span id="s32">And if you are not here after the war, I will have her christened and she will grow up as my child”.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">I know how to pray in Polish because of the prayers more better than I know my own prayers.</span> <span id="s34">She taught me I -- know it all -- I know about holidays.</span> <span id="s35">I spent with her two and a half years.</span> <span id="s36">I remember we didn’t have much to eat, we were very, very poor because my mother did not have any -- she eventually took in my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s37">We didn’t have any money, we lost everything and we had to live on the little money that she was earning in the factory which maybe would have been enough for one person but she had to feed four people on that.</span> <span id="s38">Most of the time we were hungry.</span> <span id="s39">Frania went to a neighbor and was offered a cup of tea with a lump of sugar.</span> <span id="s40">She would sneak the sugar in her pocket and bring it home.</span> <span id="s41">My mother and two children; I wonder if I could do it for my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Basically, even today I believe in providence and I believe in things that happened because they were meant to be.</span> <span id="s43">I do not believe too much in praying.</span> <span id="s44">I have seen many times in life that things have been just because probably God meant it so or whatever we call some kind of spiritual power.</span> <span id="s45">It is interesting how we were rescued by Frania, how Frania came into our life.</span> <span id="s46">When my mother was a cucooman, she helped me find my other brother, and he was a little chubby, cute baby.</span> <span id="s47">Once she took the baby in the carriage and went to park.</span> <span id="s48">On the way to park, she was stopped by a young peasant girl, who like most of the peasants in Poland, was wearing a long skirt in front of the wading pool and she was very poor and she was barefoot.</span> <span id="s49">She stopped by my mother’s carriage and she said, “Oh, what a beautiful baby you have there!”</span> <span id="s50">Naturally, each young mother thinks that her baby is beautiful and she was very flattered and she says really because it was a boy so my mother told her.</span> <span id="s51">And she said, “Can I stop and play with him a little bit?”</span> <span id="s52">And she took the rattle and was playing and my mother saw that she liked the baby.</span> <span id="s53">She told her how old she was, maybe fifteen or sixteen years old and my mother said what are you doing here and she said you know, I come for the employment and my father died very young and I was working for the priests, I was ---.</span> <span id="s54">She started to work when she was five years old in the little village and she was minding the geese.</span> <span id="s55">The priest had some geese so he took a five-year old girl and gave her a stick and she was minding the geese.</span> <span id="s56">And then as she was growing up, she was promoted to more important jobs.</span> <span id="s57">She was helping in the kitchen, and in the gardens and when she was sixteen years old or fifteen, her mother said for her to start making some real money.</span> <span id="s58">Because in the village, she could not make any money, she just worked there and she got food.</span> <span id="s59">They were poor people with many children so food to feed a child was a treasure.</span> <span id="s60">So when she was like fifteen years old, she came to us.</span> <span id="s61">She said, “I came here, I told my mother -- I came here to look for a job”.</span> <span id="s62">What do you want to do?</span> <span id="s63">“I would like to care of a child, help in the house”.</span> <span id="s64">So my mother said come to me, you have a job.</span> <span id="s65">She had a little kerchief and in her kerchief, she had (???????????????)</span> <span id="s66">.</span> <span id="s67">So, my mother brought her home, people didn’t ask for references like people ask today and they gave her a bed.</span> <span id="s68">She was very happy to take care of the baby, mostly, it was more to it.</span> <span id="s69">She was very good to him and from my parents, it was very thoughtful that they could realize that we had more help in the house.</span> <span id="s70">But she really took care of my brother and then my sister and as I have mentioned before, I came along.</span> <span id="s71">I don’t think I was really _____, it was not the style of middle class, upper class people to have three children.</span> <span id="s72">It was stylish to have one or two but when I came along she was very mad that she did not really want to bother with me too much so my parents had to hire somebody else, you may remember.</span> <span id="s73">I was told many times about this, my brother and sister used to tease me, Frania doesn’t like you like she likes us but eventually she did love me as much as anybody else.</span> <span id="s74">So when I came into hiding, she took me from ghetto, as I mentioned to you, she came at night, she took me out and we went walking and we went singing the carols and even today I remember the carols and I love Christmas like very much.</span> <span id="s75">As a matter of fact, the first Christmas after I married, already, in the United States, I was with my husband our first Christmas in Atlantic City and I said ________ because I don’t believe you – the Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s76">Today I am a practicing Jew more or less, and I said to my husband we have to go to services so, my friends, Christmas as a married woman, I went with my husband in Atlantic City to Christmas Night which was not as meaningful as it was in Poland but she took me out of the ghetto on Christmas Night and she took me to her house and took very good care of me.</span> <span id="s77">And gave me very much love.</span> <span id="s78">Then she thought I am not happy, I was missing my parents, so she brought over my sister and my mother.</span> <span id="s79">She could not do much for my father because she did not have much space in her apartment.</span> <span id="s80">We were lucky to meet my father after the war.</span> <span id="s81">Most of my friends, my Jewish friends, did not survive.</span> <span id="s82">I had very wonderful friends from before the war that didn’t survive the war.</span> <span id="s83">Since Frania was basically a very poor woman and did not have much money, she lived in a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s84">It was one room, that was living room, dining room and everything and a small kitchen and there was no place for us to hide--- it was very starkly furnished, she had the bed, one bed, she had the sofa and she had a closet, but this -was it, a small closet, a table and four chairs.</span> <span id="s85">There was not much room for us, no place to hide.</span> <span id="s86">But in Europe, the bed was fixed with all kinds of pillows, and covers and then you had a big, long bedcover and the bedcover would go to the floor.</span> <span id="s87">When I was alone, for a while, I would get along without my mother and without my sister, I was spending all my days underneath the bed.</span> <span id="s88">I was not allowed to move because neighbors shouldn’t hear.</span> <span id="s89">It was an apartment, not really, the apartment she lived in, she shared with another family so there was not even a wall between the two apartments.</span> <span id="s90">It was one big apartment broken into two or three, and they were separated by a door so on the other side of the door there lived another family.</span> <span id="s91">If I would move during the day and the neighbors knew that Frania was at work, it would be very suspicious so I was not even allowed to cough, not to breathe loud because on the other side of the door there lived a family, there lived an older woman who was all day at home and she would have noticed that something is going on in the apartment.</span> <span id="s92">They all knew that Frania is at work so I practically stayed under the bed most of the time.</span> <span id="s93">However, I suppose, maybe, at one point the neighbors grew, somehow, suspicious.</span> <span id="s94">Maybe, they didn’t grow suspicious, maybe it looked so.</span> <span id="s95">There was a point when I was _____ with my mother and my sister and we found out that the ghetto is being liquidated.</span> <span id="s96">It means that all the Jews from ghetto have been killed.</span> <span id="s97">Frania, in the evening, went to the bathroom or something, which was on the outside of the porch and she started to talk to a neighbor and the neighbor made some comment about the Jews being killed and the neighbor was not very sorry about it, no, and the neighbor said to Frania, “Do you know what?</span> <span id="s98">Some of our people are stupid enough to help the Jews?”</span> <span id="s99">She said what did that mean.</span> <span id="s100">“Some of our people are hiding the Jews!”</span> <span id="s101">Now, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s102">Frania came home and we had altercation, we were close enough.</span> <span id="s103">We got very upset and Frania said to my mother, “I had a feeling that she suspects something”.</span> <span id="s104">Maybe she didn’t suspect, maybe it was just a general statement, but Frania had a plan.</span> <span id="s105">So the next day she decided she’s not going to work.</span> <span id="s106">Somehow she notifies the place of work, there’s no telephone so she notifies the place of work and she says “I’m not coming to work today.</span> <span id="s107">I have to take a kitchen day”, or whatever she made up.</span> <span id="s108">She told her neighbor my house is really so neglected, I have to take general cleaning, make general cleaning … She opens all her windows, all her doors and started to tear the apartment apart, cleaning.</span> <span id="s109">She wanted the people to see, to come in, to be able to come in to the apartment and to see that she really does not have anyone.</span> <span id="s110">So, as evidence, we have to go from under the bed because it’s too dangerous.</span> <span id="s111">She put my mother in a closet.</span> <span id="s112">She put my mother in a closet which looked like today’s armoire and my poor mother was sitting in that closet, my mother was a tall woman, taller than I and I am not a small thing.</span> <span id="s113">My sister and I were stuffed in a box.</span> <span id="s114">The box looked like a huge suitcase, not a suitcase, a chest, some kind of chest that was really given to her by my parents.</span> <span id="s115">My father was bringing furs??</span> <span id="s116">His merchandise from the groat in that chest.</span> <span id="s117">My sister and I, we were sitting, like forged together in that chest, an she opened a little bit the cover and put something, some food, we should not choke on it.</span> <span id="s118">We cover and we were sitting there for two hours rigid, not being able to move.</span> <span id="s119">Finally, after Frania made big order in the house, airing, took the beds apart, took the mattresses outside so the people could see and neighbors came in and ‘Oh, Mrs. Osobkowa we have never been to your room’.</span> <span id="s120">So she showed her apartment, the mattress was out and the bed was empty.</span> <span id="s121">Nobody could even believe that there was --- that some things were ---.</span> <span id="s122">She was very resourceful and a very intelligent woman to do that.</span> <span id="s123">It was month of the infidel??</span></p> <p><span id="s124">I remember another incident when she came home in the evening from work and was completely pale.</span> <span id="s125">We could see that her face was white and she said, ---.</span> <span id="s126">My mother said, “Frania what happened?</span> <span id="s127">It seems that you are very disturbed.”</span> <span id="s128">Frania said, “Yes, as I was coming home, I passed by the market”.</span> <span id="s129">It was the main place of the town so for Drohobycz, it was like a market place.</span> <span id="s130">“And you know what I saw?</span> <span id="s131">They caught a family of Jews that were hidden by Polish people and they hanged them in the marketplace.</span> <span id="s132">Together they were hanging.</span> <span id="s133">The Jewish people together with the Polish people”.</span> <span id="s134">So my mother said, “You know, Frania, I feel so sorry for you”.</span> <span id="s135">So she said, “Don’t feel sorry for me”.</span> <span id="s136">She had two big pictures of saints, Maria and Jesus.</span> <span id="s137">She too the big picture of the man, holy picture and hung it over my mother’s sofa.</span> <span id="s138">She going to take care of it.</span> <span id="s139">This today when I travel with my husband, I always come in a town, I always go to church.</span> <span id="s140">And I always give money and I always take a candle and light it.</span> <span id="s141">She believed, my good friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">I could tell you many more stories about Frania’s generosity and beautiful hands.</span> <span id="s143">I remember one day when we went to sleep.</span> <span id="s144">We were very poor, we were very hungry.</span> <span id="s145">We had nothing already to sell and we went to sleep often, very hungry.</span> <span id="s146">We didn’t _________.</span> <span id="s147">And at night, we hear somebody moving around.</span> <span id="s148">I open my eyes and see Frania shaking and she says, get up.</span> <span id="s149">I say, what is it?</span> <span id="s150">She says, I don’t know, I couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s151">I cooked something.</span> <span id="s152">I found some black flour in the kitchen on cupboard and I make little dumplings and I put a little saccharine.</span> <span id="s153">Come, we’ll all eat together.</span> <span id="s154">She woke up my mother and my sister to share the food with me.</span> <span id="s155">Then came Christmas and we wanted to do something for her because she was believing in Christmas and it was important to her.</span> <span id="s156">We knew that it is important and we also knew that she was deprived of many things because she had to share everything with us.</span> <span id="s157">So I remember my sister was quite resourceful and found some old pajamas or whatever and made a little baby dress out of it.</span> <span id="s158">She was a young girl, but very dainty.</span> <span id="s159">She made some little things.</span> <span id="s160">We gave it to Frania and she went to the market.</span> <span id="s161">She sold it.</span> <span id="s162">She had a little money.</span> <span id="s163">I still remember the little apron or dress that my sister made or maybe it was a baby dress and an apron.</span> <span id="s164">She was like fourteen -- or fifteen years old girl but she was very good with her hands.</span> <span id="s165">We had a little bit money and Frania bought some flour, maybe some pottery.</span> <span id="s166">I don’t think we had ________money then.</span> <span id="s167">And then we went to another baking, cakes for her.</span> <span id="s168">The cakes were a sort of pancake.</span> <span id="s169">We cannot remember.</span> <span id="s170">We didn’t have yeast, so we couldn’t grow.</span> <span id="s171">We put some kind of powder.</span> <span id="s172">I remember when we often would take the ________ to bite.</span> <span id="s173">They were flat.</span> <span id="s174">They were not good.</span> <span id="s175">We pretended that they were cake.</span> <span id="s176">It was Easter.</span> <span id="s177">She came from the church.</span> <span id="s178">In Poland, it is very important to bring the food, the priest should bless it.</span> <span id="s179">She took the food cakes to church and the food cake was blessed.</span> <span id="s180">And we pretended that everything is good and delicious.</span> <span id="s181">We actually started like that.</span> <span id="s182">Then, the Russians were coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s183">We never knew what is going on outside.</span> <span id="s184">Naturally she didn’t have a radio.</span> <span id="s185">She couldn’t buy a newspaper because it would be suspicious.</span> <span id="s186">People, her neighbors, knew that she did not know how to write or to read.</span> <span id="s187">So she would come up with a newspaper, it would have to be everything we did had to be very calculated.</span> <span id="s188">But we heard some noises, we heard like shooting, artillery going.</span> <span id="s189">One day, the Russians came to the town and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s190">We went out.</span> <span id="s191">She did not want ever mention, her neighbors to know about it because I am embarrassed to tell you that many of the neighbors were very anti-Semitic and many said that it was good that the Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s192">So she did not want to antagonize the neighbors so we came out.</span> <span id="s193">And we couldn’t come back to the house because we did not want to embarrass her in front of her neighbors.</span> <span id="s194">I don’t remember such a great childhood.</span> <span id="s195">We had very bad experience because the Russian soldiers were not nice to us.</span> <span id="s196">They say to my mother, you must have done something wrong.</span> <span id="s197">You must have collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s198">Otherwise you wouldn’t have survived.</span> <span id="s199">We were expecting so much sympathy from a ________ after the war and we were all the time planning what the whole world is going to try to compensate us for our experience.</span> <span id="s200">This came from the Russian soldiers and they said, when my mother told them she was Jewish, “You must have collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s201">Otherwise ---“ So, you know, we had double problems, you know.</span> <span id="s202">So we found some other Jewish family and we stuck together for two days until we found some kind of an apartment.</span> <span id="s203">We had nothing to eat, we had no food, we had no money.</span> <span id="s204">My mother found, met someone, an old friend, also a Jewish woman, who unfortunately lost her two sons and survived with her husband in Poland.</span> <span id="s205">And when she told my mother of the two children, she gave her some money.</span> <span id="s206">She had some money left.</span> <span id="s207">She gave my mother money and said go and buy meat for you, buy some bread.</span> <span id="s208">And very soon my mother got to Frania and was working _____ ______.</span> <span id="s209">She got a job in a dairy of some kind of, not factory, but they were doing all kinds of making or producing their product.</span> <span id="s210">And whenever she could steal something, she would bring it to us.</span> <span id="s211">Then she never stopped caring.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">What I wanted to say, that eventually we left Poland and in 1949 or 1950, we left Poland and we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s213">As I mentioned before, I am the third of three children.</span> <span id="s214">And we are only two today.</span> <span id="s215">I had a brother who was five and a half years older than me and in the beginning of the war, he got sick and due to bad conditions, he could not be properly diagnosed.</span> <span id="s216">Just today, I talk to my sister, and we are wondering what really happened to him.</span> <span id="s217">I have a feeling that he had walking pneumonia.</span> <span id="s218">He was fourteen years old when he died, at the very beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s219">It was a terrible tragedy; it was the first time that I encountered death.</span> <span id="s220">In the time later, it became a daily trend.</span> <span id="s221">I have seen it so many times that ---.</span> <span id="s222">But it was the first time, it was a terrible tragedy,_________ of all families.</span> <span id="s223">Needless to say, Frania was shattered, almost unbelievable, as my mother.</span> <span id="s224">They went together to the funeral and they were both crying like they both loved him very, very much.</span> <span id="s225">She still, to the end, always talked about him.</span> <span id="s226">It was her baby, it was the baby that changed her whole life.</span> <span id="s227">This was the baby, that because of the baby she came into our family.</span> <span id="s228">The baby was fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s229">He was very big, he was very tall, he was a huge young man, to have him for her baby.</span> <span id="s230">Many times later, my mother said, you know, Frania, it is a good thing that he died.</span> <span id="s231">Because if he didn’t die, he would be killed.</span> <span id="s232">This one got killed, and this -- most of his friends got killed.</span> <span id="s233">And Frania would say, no, I would never let him be killed.</span> <span id="s234">I would have prevented it.</span> <span id="s235">So, we were left in the ghetto with our parents.</span> <span id="s236">In 1945, one year after our town was liberated, we still did not live together.</span> <span id="s237">Frania was still embarrassed that she saved Jews.</span> <span id="s238">She came to our house only in the evening, people shouldn’t see, but we were in constant touch.</span> <span id="s239">We had seen that?</span> <span id="s240">Over time, Polish people would be evacuated to the new Polish territory and we all left Poland.</span> <span id="s241">We considered ourselves Polish citizens and all Polish citizen left.</span> <span id="s242">Only the Ukrainians remained there.</span> <span id="s243">We were traveling in very primitive trains and it took a long time, four weeks, until we arrived at our destination.</span> <span id="s244">Many, many times that she was traveling with us together, we were already together, and one more thing.</span> <span id="s245">People came from concentration camps and people told us that they saw my father in Auschwitz, in Plaszow, in Bielitz, in Germany, in different concentration camps.</span> <span id="s246">There were even some people who said that he was dead.</span> <span id="s247">There were some men that came to my mother and said, “You are a widow.</span> <span id="s248">Why don’t we get married?”</span> <span id="s249">Men_______ who loved their families.</span> <span id="s250">My mother was not interested in getting married again and we were going to Poland and we were sure that my father is dead.</span> <span id="s251">One morning, on the train, I was sleeping, as usual, next to Frania, and she woke me up.</span> <span id="s252">She said, “Look, who is here!”</span> <span id="s253">I had a pet name that they called me at home, when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s254">She always called me by that name, a funny little name and she called me by that name.</span> <span id="s255">She shook me and said, “Look who is here.”</span> <span id="s256">Here I see my father stepping in front of the train, in front of our compartment, tall and handsome and dashing through the train, well dressed, with a big bag and I thought I see a ghost.</span> <span id="s257">I was screaming and I was petrified.</span> <span id="s258">I jumped on him and he was there, he was real, he hugged me and he kissed me.</span> <span id="s259">A few minutes later, I say, “Daddy, what do you have in that bag?”</span> <span id="s260">Because I remember when he was coming from all his trips from the road, before the war, there was always most beautiful gifts for us.</span> <span id="s261">Believe it or not, he was not sure that we were alive.</span> <span id="s262">Somebody had some vague rumors that we were alive but he attributed them to _____.</span> <span id="s263">He had very fancy raincoats for my sister and for me, blue raincoats and they were in that bag!</span> <span id="s264">So when I opened the bag, here was a gift for me.</span> <span id="s265">He had prepared just in case he needed them.</span> <span id="s266">We were reunited with Father and for the next few months, my father, every day after business, he was taking home, closing the door, closing the windows, and my father would tell us horror stories about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s267">Horror stories.</span> <span id="s268">The last year, I went for a visit to Poland and from Cracow, I took a tour, a bus to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s269">When I was walking through Auschwitz, it seemed to me that I was there before because I saw all the places that my father was telling us.</span> <span id="s270">What happened here and what happened there, for a month, everything he walked, ________.</span> <span id="s271">He was telling us how this died and how that died and how this died and all the people that we knew, young boys, young girls, people, how -- what people went through, he sat every evening and we were listening to him talk about the problem.</span> <span id="s272">So when I came to concentration camp, to Auschwitz, I felt I know all about it, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s273">It was not me talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Anyway, we lived in Legnica and I went through high school there.</span> <span id="s275">Right after the war, in Poland, also my father was a good businessman and financially we were doing okay.</span> <span id="s276">But it was terrible and I could not ________________.</span> <span id="s277">But somehow people manage and people look always for the good things, for the nice things, but there weren’t very many people that were nice to us including a principal of Gamati who made up his mind, Professor Bodola -- he must be a dead man now because it was in 1946 or ’47, that I went to this man.</span> <span id="s278">He decided that he does not know the Jewish kids in the high school, he was principal.</span> <span id="s279">And my father who was an educated man, told him that I knew how to talk to him and tells him that he will go to the Ministry of Education, of Department of Education in Warsaw to find out why I can’t be admitted to this high school.</span> <span id="s280">So, he admitted me because he had no choice.</span> <span id="s281">But for two years, he made my life miserable.</span> <span id="s282">I cannot even begin to tell you and I don’t know how I wanted so much to go to school.</span> <span id="s283">I know my kids never wanted so much to go to school and they had not the condition.</span> <span id="s284">It was the most important thing for me to go to school.</span> <span id="s285">Maybe because I missed it so much, I wanted to be part of -- have a normal life.</span> <span id="s286">So Professor Bodola was a principal of that high school, and was teaching classes and I was starting humanities in high school and I had every day from eight to ten o’clock, Latin.</span> <span id="s287">Every morning from eight to ten, he had the __________.</span> <span id="s288">No matter what I did, no matter what I say, my father hired a private tutor and the private tutor said to my father, I don’t know, I cannot teach her any more because she knows almost as much as I do.</span> <span id="s289">But in the class, I always got an F.</span> <span id="s290">At one point, I was translating something, I don’t remember and there was a word, tyrum??</span> <span id="s291">_______ is a ______.</span> <span id="s292">So somebody said, have you ever seen a lamb?</span> <span id="s293">.</span> <span id="s294">I said yes, where?</span> <span id="s295">I said, in a meadow???</span> <span id="s296">No answer.</span> <span id="s297">Sit down.</span> <span id="s298">And for two years, for three semesters, which was three quarters, I was getting an F and I was sure that I am going to fail.</span> <span id="s299">If you get one respect ??</span> <span id="s300">So we had a very good ______.</span> <span id="s301">One day Mr. Bodola was removed.</span> <span id="s302">Apparently he did some other things that were not right and he was removed.</span> <span id="s303">And we got a new principal, Professor Kaploski.</span> <span id="s304">Somehow, I couldn’t do anything wrong for him.</span> <span id="s305">I stopped studying at all.</span> <span id="s306">I sneezed, I got an A. No matter what, you know.</span> <span id="s307">It didn’t do me any favor because I stopped studying completely on the subject he was teaching us.</span> <span id="s308">He taught us philosophy.</span> <span id="s309">I got A whatever I did so kind of feel in life, got to give you on one hand, taking away with the other hand.</span> <span id="s310">So whatever Bodola did for me, Professor Kaploski did the kind work.</span> <span id="s311">Recently I found a girl who is the late?</span> <span id="s312">Grown woman who lives in Mineka with a lawyer and she was one of the very few girls in high school who was a nice girl, it didn’t bother her that I was Jewish, we talked together.</span> <span id="s313">After many, many years, I picked up, I found her.</span> <span id="s314">Maybe, I’m helping her a little bit.</span> <span id="s315">She wrote me a letter that she never knew that out friendship meant so much to me.</span> <span id="s316">She apparently looked at me as an ordinary schoolmate.</span> <span id="s317">It was very important that somebody in those days treated me normally.</span> <span id="s318">In the winter of 1949, the Jews were allowed to leave for Israel.</span> <span id="s319">My family decided to go to Israel and my parents offered Frania to go with us.</span> <span id="s320">They promised her, there were ways, with money you could arrange all kinds of -- an arrangement could be made, to transfer her to Israel although non-Jewish people were not allowed to go but we could have done it.</span> <span id="s321">She refused to go.</span> <span id="s322">She said, “You know I’m going to miss you very much but this is my country, this is my language, this is my religion, this is my priest.</span> <span id="s323">I go to church, I understand what the priest is saying, I belong here.”</span> <span id="s324">So we left but we were heartbroken; we cried for months, all of us.</span> <span id="s325">We went to Israel, we would write the letter, it was very different.</span> <span id="s326">In Israel, in 1950, it was very difficult to live.</span> <span id="s327">The colonical??</span> <span id="s328">Situation was very bad -- no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s329">The country was very poor.</span> <span id="s330">We didn’t do too well.</span> <span id="s331">Then my sister got married and she passed _______.</span> <span id="s332">We went to school, we studied, we went to the university but my sister we were sending Frania every cent we could spare, all countries from Israel.</span> <span id="s333">Some money, very little, we didn’t have much.</span> <span id="s334">But I remember that one of the first lessons she was to give, “Now that you are in Israel, don’t send me any more money.</span> <span id="s335">Your husband does not know me.</span> <span id="s336">It is not fair to him, he should send me money.</span> <span id="s337">I am a complete stranger.”</span> <span id="s338">I don’t think a mother could write a letter like that.</span> <span id="s339">She was not a wealthy woman, we left her provided but it was years, took her years, she was on and off .</span> <span id="s340">We always writing to her, we always send whatever we could.</span> <span id="s341">I came to the United States 31 years ago but I was always in touch with her, sent pictures, she sent pictures back.</span> <span id="s342">We sent packages to her and always she would say, please don’t send, maybe your husband will be unhappy, maybe you will need it.</span> <span id="s343">She never took advantage of our situation but we did help her out.</span> <span id="s344">Eventually she took in, she was a very loving woman, she had a brother who had children and the brother was a poor man so she adopted one of his daughters and raised her as her own.</span> <span id="s345">She needed somebody to give love to.</span> <span id="s346">About 15 or 16 years ago, I found out that actually people in Gradzanowo, Poland were many _______ _______.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">I think you know what this time that you should be right.</span> <span id="s348">We bought a ticket, we split the money, my sister was in Atlanta, Georgia that day.</span> <span id="s349">We put together the money, the ticket was quite expensive;
