I’d -- in order to begin, I’d like to ask you if -- if you, in the last 14 years since the interview that I saw took place, is there anything about your experience during the war that you’ve learned since then, that you’d like to go back and talk about it?</span> <span id="s18">Know -- how much you remember, exactly, about your interview, but I’m assuming that you -- it was clear to me that you’ve been doing research, and finding out more and more about what happened to you, since you were so young.</span> <span id="s19">Is there anything that you might want to add to what you already did?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Answer: Let me get to that in one moment, but let me also make a -- not a disclaimer, but a commercial statement in a sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: -- in that I just want to acknowledge the importance, and I want to say thank you to the museum for doing this, because I have believed for some time that the archiving of this information is extremely important.</span> <span id="s23">And I’ve said publicly, privately, that even though every interviewee’s information, including mine, may not be earth-shaking, or startling, the fact that it’s archived, and the technology is available to do it, is terribly important.</span> <span id="s24">How interesting it would be if I go to the -- whatever museum, take out a tape of a Civil War soldier, talking from the Civil War, not a mere reenactment, and we could learn so much.</span> <span id="s25">So I just want to acknowledge, and extend my appreciation for whoever sponsors this, and for the museum for doing it.</span> <span id="s26">I do understand now this has been now going on for maybe 10 years, these second interviews.</span> <span id="s27">I really thought it was a brand new idea.</span> <span id="s28">But I’m delighted to do it.</span> <span id="s29">Let me get to the question that you asked.</span> <span id="s30">I don’t know if I’ve learned anything specific.</span> <span id="s31">Much of what I know about the Holocaust, I know from -- from memory, and I’ve said before now, and I’ll repeat -- I’ll try not to repeat myself too frequently, to say that I was old enough to remember, because my memory apparently works well, and much too young to understand.</span> <span id="s32">Which makes yo -- me a survivor whose emotional scars are quite different than people my age, and two, three, four years older, who in fact understood.</span> <span id="s33">I thought I was being a little pint sized hero for wearing a yellow star.</span> <span id="s34">I didn’t think it was a stigma.</span> <span id="s35">I couldn’t understand the concept of stigma.</span> <span id="s36">I mean, I too have, like an adult, that’s a good thing.</span> <span id="s37">All six year olds want to be like big people.</span> <span id="s38">So it isn’t so much that I’ve learned a lot, although I’m sure I’ve learned certain things about myself, my father, my mother, and others, what I’ve done the last 14 years different than before, and it’s not because of the interview, was I be -- have become very much more involved in Holocaust kinds of things, in order to make use of the survivors, because we are a dying population, and I can identify for you -- and again, I don’t think I did before, that the night that Steven Spielberg -- that’s a matter of just a coincidence, received the Academy Award for Schindler, he said that there are, at that time, as I think he said, 350,000 survivors, I guess, in the United States.</span> <span id="s39">And I was flabbergasted because in relative terms, it’s a very small number.</span> <span id="s40">I mean, 350,000 people, and that’s a dozen years ago, whenever that was.</span> <span id="s41">So there are less today.</span> <span id="s42">And I said maybe I need to, in some way be involved, because I’m one of the younger survivors you’ll meet -- I’m only 67 years old, do something to archive, to use, to teach, because if we don’t, this is an -- this is an irreplaceable commodity.</span> <span id="s43">If we don’t do what we need to do, after we’re gone, it can be done, but differently.</span> <span id="s44">A second generation experience is different than the initial experience that those of us who were there, in all the places, can tell.</span> <span id="s45">So I’ve become involved in a number of things, but I think that’s the major change, since that time.</span> <span id="s46">Not so much what I’ve learned, but what I’ve done with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s48">Do you want to talk about some of things you’ve done?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, I have probably spoken in a -- in a gazillion places.</span> <span id="s50">I’ve been involved locally with the Jewish [indecipherable] Council, which sponsors an annual Yom HaShoah commemoration that’s six, seven, 800 people, attendance thing, and all the largest synagogues in the community, I’ve chaired it for the last five years.</span> <span id="s51">And I did -- I’ve been a member of that commission for 15 or 18 years, but I thought maybe I’d like to become more involved.</span> <span id="s52">And that involves with some other elements of the Holocaust thing.</span> <span id="s53">Serve the museum, museum visits, museum volunteering, some other things.</span> <span id="s54">I have some connection with the legislature, as a consequence I’ve tried to help the council, and the museum be involved with legislators to come to the museum, or to meet them there, or to speak with them there.</span> <span id="s55">These are things I’ve done, I’ve -- anecdotally, one of the things I’ve done is our organizations that have silent auctions, I’ve been a silent auction museum tour giver in any number of organizations.</span> <span id="s56">If you bid on my particular offer, and it’s a winning offer, whatever the organization decides, I will in fact take a half a day, and take you and four other people to the museum, and the most interesting group I had once, was a -- a woman, I forget what her organization was, she called, and we arranged, and there were four women, and I, all veterinarians.</span> <span id="s57">I don’t think they were Jewish, but they were involved in some organization, and they wanted to see the museum, and I was there with four veterinarians.</span> <span id="s58">I had never been with that many veterinarians in my life, women or otherwise.</span> <span id="s59">Just an interesting combination of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I’ve done that, I have probably been involved in the -- in a -- to a greater degree in the three organizations that are Holocaust organizations in the community.</span> <span id="s62">There is the Washington fre -- th-the survivors and friends organization, with which you may be familiar.</span> <span id="s63">There is a child survivors organization, which covers more Baltimore/ Washington, and there’s a second generation.</span> <span id="s64">And now there is a third generation organization, and I have gotten to know some of the people, I’ve been involved in some of the meetings, some of the planning, some of the conferences.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s66">That’s quite a lot, yeah.</span> <span id="s67">And do you talk with the schoolchildren?</span> <span id="s68">Have you done any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, for example, recently there was a cooperative program within the council and Comcast, and the [indecipherable] Olney theater, here in Olney.</span> <span id="s70">And several high school classes were brought -- several high schools, and they [indecipherable] 11th grade class, were brought together for a -- an orientation, a talk, a -- a video, and after that they even did projects expressing the Holocaust in art, music and design.</span> <span id="s71">And we spoke to those four schools.</span> <span id="s72">The next year, there were four other schools.</span> <span id="s73">These have been things that I’ve done.</span> <span id="s74">There was a training program, for example, for the Jewish Social Service Agency, JESSA, and five years ago, I think it was, when we spent four days, one day a week in four weeks, in a very comprehensive training program for their staff, including a visit to the museum, which I, as a volunteer put together for them, with a director of the agency, and it was a pretty successful thing involving all of their people, on the assumption that if they deal with Holocaust survivors, they ou-ought to know something about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Is it possible for you to summarize what -- how people react to your presentations when you meet with them?</span> <span id="s76">People who may not know a lot about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s77">I’m talking about groups aside from survivor groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: React in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: How do they react?</span> <span id="s80">I mean, what do they want to know, what -- what do they not know?</span> <span id="s81">What does it --</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Well -- there are probably at least two major kinds of presentation, and I do one because I’m unable, or whatever to do the other.</span> <span id="s83">The -- those presentations which are based in the emotional experience, but as I said to you, my emotional experience at the time was very limited, I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s84">So what I do is I do a much more -- not objective, but I guess it’s an objective approach to describing what happened, from the eyes of a six, seven, eight, nine, 10 year old kid.</span> <span id="s85">The reaction to that often is amazement, to the point, and this is again anecdotal, but I spoke to whatever, the fifth grade Hebrew school class of my synagogue.</span> <span id="s86">And the fifth grade Hebrew school class, one of them, included my grandson at the time.</span> <span id="s87">And he asked a question at the end.</span> <span id="s88">And he became so kind of involved in the description, he said, “Did you survive?”</span> <span id="s89">I’m his grandfather, I mean, he was like trying to ask, how did people survive, so he said to me, “Did you survive?”</span> <span id="s90">He’s forgotten, I mean, this could have been a movie that I was describing.</span> <span id="s91">So the reaction tends to be less visceral in some sense, and more factual, because I tend to present factually, rather than emotionally, for many reasons, including the kind of person I am, and the nature of my experience, of people that I know in the community who are one, two, three, four, five years older than I, whose experience was different as a consequence, they present differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s93">That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s94">Let’s g -- let’s go back to your chronology, if you will.</span> <span id="s95">It was 1949 when you came to this country with your mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Mm, well, my father came in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: My father -- we were all in, at that time, Palestine.</span> <span id="s99">Israel happened a few months after my father left.</span> <span id="s100">My father came to this country for two reasons.</span> <span id="s101">One stated, and one kind of unstated.</span> <span id="s102">The stated reason was, of the seven children, six siblings and my father, two had died in 1930 of causes other than Holocaust, two women, one married, one unmarried.</span> <span id="s103">Two brothers were killed during the war.</span> <span id="s104">One brother was in Israel, my father, and the seventh child, the oldest, was in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s105">My aunt had come here in 1914, in some ways to be with some cousins, to reduce the burden, which was difficult.</span> <span id="s106">My grandparents -- my grandfather, I am told -- I never met him, he died before I was born, again for non-Holocaust related reasons, he died 1930.</span> <span id="s107">He was not a successful businessman, and they had some very difficult times.</span> <span id="s108">He became a -- kind of a county clerk of some sort, because he could read and write, and he knew Hungarian well, besides Yiddish and Jewish things, and it was difficult to make a living.</span> <span id="s109">So my aunt came out here.</span> <span id="s110">My father wanted to see his surviving sister, whom he had not seen since 1914 when he was eight -- no, he was 10, and she was 14 or 15, or something like that.</span> <span id="s111">The other reason was that my father, being a professional cantor all his life, trained as a cantor, not just something he did part time, found that it was very difficult to make a living, because that’s one of the things Israel did not need too many of at the time.</span> <span id="s112">And he chose to -- he found a way to legally stay, he did, and then in ’49, my mother and I came.</span> <span id="s113">Now we’re in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s115">What do you remember getting off -- you were at Idlewild Airport.</span> <span id="s116">What do you remember when you came in, and what were your expectations of the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I had no idea.</span> <span id="s118">I honestly had no idea.</span> <span id="s119">Remember that being of that age, and at that time, the number of movies that people saw -- I mean, movies were a -- a treat number one, and they were infrequent.</span> <span id="s120">And when I lived in Israel, went to the movie, and I can tell you the names of the movie theaters.</span> <span id="s121">But they were movies from various places, and I didn’t -- I didn’t have an understanding of what the size of this country, the dimensions of this country, the opportunities of this country were, and I’m not sure that’s something that a ni -- nine year old would -- well, by that time I’m 13, but even a 13 year old wouldn’t know that.</span> <span id="s122">My orientation was much more in terms of European recollections of things, and certainly this country did not appear to be the same way.</span> <span id="s123">I was fascinating by -- first I came by plane.</span> <span id="s124">Now, I got on the plane in a -- what had been a military airport outside of Haifa, two engine plane, flew to -- for refueling in Egypt, for refueling in Tunis, from Tunis to Nice, from Nice to Brussels.</span> <span id="s125">Spent overnight in Brussels, and from Brussels took the big bird to Shannon, to Gander, in Newfoundland, and then to New York.</span> <span id="s126">That was the typical way, but it was by plane.</span> <span id="s127">My father had come the year before, it took him three weeks, I think, by boat.</span> <span id="s128">But it was just a question of how people traveled.</span> <span id="s129">So you arrive at this place, and I remember waking up in the morning after an overnight flight, and my first inclination was, as I looked out the window, was to get out and walk, because the clouds looked like sheep.</span> <span id="s130">They looked s -- as solid as rocks.</span> <span id="s131">Now I knew that that’s not a good idea, and I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s132">But it was uneventful flight of -- probably the hop from Shannon to Gander must have been 10 hours.</span> <span id="s133">And then from Gander down, another six.</span> <span id="s134">We traveled probably 30 hours all together.</span> <span id="s135">But we arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s136">Now, you have to remember that Idlewild, which we now know as JFK didn’t look the same.</span> <span id="s137">It was kind of a little airport, because international flights had not been too common, one because the war had just ended, and two, that was not the kind of aircraft, the jets hadn’t come in, not for another 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: And the prop-driven four engine planes had to make hop, to hop, to hop, to hop.</span> <span id="s140">It was still quicker than ship, but -- so we arrived.</span> <span id="s141">Now, at the airport, my father and my aunt, his sister, were waiting for us, and in a matter of minutes, it seemed, we were kind of hustled by taxi -- that was not unusual, taxis I knew, to Pennsylvania station, in the city, on a train, to Philadelphia, where we spent some time kind of getting acquainted.</span> <span id="s142">And I remember seeing a sign on the bridge between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, in Trenton, which I couldn’t read then, but I had taken that train ride subsequently many, many times, and it says Trenton makes, the world takes.</span> <span id="s143">Took me years to figure out what that meant.</span> <span id="s144">But it was one of the initial things.</span> <span id="s145">In those days when you went by train, or you went by subway, you had these various dispensing machines, much less sophisticated than what we have now.</span> <span id="s146">I was absolutely fascinated by the gum machine, where you could put in a nickel or whatever, couple pennies, and get Chiclets.</span> <span id="s147">And I wanted to kind of do it all the time.</span> <span id="s148">I was fascinated by Venetian blinds.</span> <span id="s149">I was fascinated -- certainly by television set, which my aunt had, as I remember, but we didn’t for awhile.</span> <span id="s150">Now, radios were not unusual, radios were common.</span> <span id="s151">Cars were not unusual, although the number were common.</span> <span id="s152">So that the impressions you had -- what I had is twofold, what I’ll leave you with.</span> <span id="s153">One, the impressions of a 13 year old in a new place.</span> <span id="s154">And the impressions of a 13 year old in a new place called the United States.</span> <span id="s155">I knew very little about the States yet, at the time.</span> <span id="s156">I didn’t begin to know about until we moved back to New York, after about two weeks of staying here, and my parents took a sublet apartment, and I began to go to school.</span> <span id="s157">And I s -- we spent a year and a half in New York, I was in school for about a year.</span> <span id="s158">I came here in what would be equivalent to seventh grade.</span> <span id="s159">So I finished seven B in New York, in those days with A’s and B’s.</span> <span id="s160">Did eight A in New York, same school.</span> <span id="s161">I can tell you about that, too, because it had impact, a significant impact.</span> <span id="s162">And then we moved to Philadelphia where my father lived the rest of his life.</span> <span id="s163">My mother died in Philadelphia, and I was in Philadelphia until 1961, till I finished graduate school, and then my wife and I, and daughter at the time, left town.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Tell me about going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, the point of school was that -- people think this is just words, but schools are the Mixmasters of society, particularly in a place like New York.</span> <span id="s166">Now, my father found a sublet apartment in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s169">Remember, my father’s congregation was on the east side of Rivington Street, had to be walking distance.</span> <span id="s170">Even though he performed in that congregation only once a month, it’s that kind of job.</span> <span id="s171">Still had to be walking distance.</span> <span id="s172">During -- on other Sabbaths, we went to some local synagogue, a small one, whatever, in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s173">But we are on -- on the village in the west side.</span> <span id="s174">We are in the heart of the famous part of the village, Bleeker Street, McDougall Street, and we were on Barrow Street, 72 Barrow.</span> <span id="s175">An apartment building where people were away, and we sublet their apartment.</span> <span id="s176">School became an important thing, obviously, and my father made some inquiries, I suppose, he was not familiar, for me to go to one of the Jewish-type day schools.</span> <span id="s177">And there were many of them in the general community, subway rides.</span> <span id="s178">And I remember going to them, and I remember that one of them, I forget the name, insignificant, said, “We will be glad to have the young man,” -- I mean, I was fluent in Hebrew -- “we’ll put him in third grade.”</span> <span id="s179">“Why?”</span> <span id="s180">“Well, he doesn’t speak English.”</span> <span id="s181">Which is true.</span> <span id="s182">I had some knowledge of English, but very spotty, and very unreliable.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And either of your parents speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, my father had been here for a year, and he spoke some.</span> <span id="s185">Again, street English, learned.</span> <span id="s186">My mother didn’t, she knew less that I did.</span> <span id="s187">My mother, by that time, spoke Hungarian, Serb, passable German.</span> <span id="s188">Not passable, but somewhat street French from school.</span> <span id="s189">But she had studied knowing that sh -- English was not taught in Europe when they were in school.</span> <span id="s190">I knew very little.</span> <span id="s191">I mean, Trenton makes, the world takes, I could not read, then.</span> <span id="s192">I was 13, I was not, you know, an infant.</span> <span id="s193">But there was something about the notion of third grade that didn’t make any sense for many reasons, not only the fact that I’d lose four years, I could probably make them up, but a 13 year old is not going to have anything in common with a nine year old, or a 10 year old.</span> <span id="s194">There’s a difference, I mean, raging puberty was probably taking place, and all those other things that happen in early teens were taking place, and that did not put me into any kind of a connection with the younger kids.</span> <span id="s195">So my parents, somehow, and I don’t recall -- I don’t -- I can’t remember how they discovered that the public school happened to be exactly a block from the apartment.</span> <span id="s196">P.S. number three, on Hudson Street.</span> <span id="s197">The principal was a Jew.</span> <span id="s198">I’m not sure that’s terribly significant, but there may have been some -- I had with me a letter from Haifa, saying that I had completed so much of seventh grade, but the curriculums are different.</span> <span id="s199">The principal said the following, he said, “We’ll put him in seventh grade.</span> <span id="s200">We’ll give him an allowance, he will not have to take classes in Spanish.”</span> <span id="s201">Which was already being taught.</span> <span id="s202">“If he makes it, he’ll go to eighth grade, and if he doesn’t, he’ll repeat seventh grade, it’s pretty simple.”</span> <span id="s203">Which made an awful lot of sense.</span> <span id="s204">And obviously I was able to pick up enough to begin to go on, and kids, first of all, are spongelike, and you pick up.</span> <span id="s205">And one of the differences between me and people who are three or four years older, who came here maybe after high school, or at the end of high school, you have different language pattern, you have a different knowledge of English, and people after 50 years, still speak like they got off the boat.</span> <span id="s206">I never did a thing in my life to try to deal with the way I spoke, but I tried to learn the language as well as I could, so I have command of it.</span> <span id="s207">In P.S. number three, I could do that.</span> <span id="s208">And that had significant impact in that I continued, at least age appropriately, as opposed to continuing in a way that was, you know, kind of as a sore thumb sticking out, a kid two feet taller than everybody else in the class, cause I was 13.</span> <span id="s209">So that had very significant impact.</span> <span id="s210">Then I continued through public school in Philadelphia, and that’s -- we’ll get to that at some point if you wish, but that had an important element.</span> <span id="s211">My father then decided that although he could have stayed at that congregation in New York, I guess indefinitely -- well not indefinitely, but certainly for awhile, cause community had begun to change in some ways.</span> <span id="s212">He thought that he would like to live in a community, so his wife and son could have a life in a community, and New York is not a community in that sense, not when you’re there once a month, and you have nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s213">We moved to Philadelphia in 1950, and I spent the next 11 years in Philadelphia with my parents, and well, eventually with my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: What was it like for you to be in school there, not speaking English at first, and -- did you feel like an outsider, did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: No, because the kid next to me was from China, and the kid next to him was from Italy, and the kid next to him was from some Spanish speaking -- and I remember vaguely these two kids, the Italian and the -- I don’t even know if it was a Chinese youngster, but he’s certainly an Oriental kid, he could have been Korean, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s216">But he came -- he wasn’t in school one day.</span> <span id="s217">Next day he comes in, and I say to him, “Where were you yesterday?”</span> <span id="s218">He says, “I played hooky.”</span> <span id="s219">“Oh,” I says, “with a stick?”</span> <span id="s220">I didn’t know the word hooky, but I learned the word hooky from my Chinese friend, who was playing hooky, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Hello.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Oh, you want a -- maybe mink or something, but you’re asking about -- you asked about the reaction of the other kids, my reaction to them.</span> <span id="s223">New York was probably the best -- in one way it’s the best place to break in.</span> <span id="s224">I suppose Iowa would have been just as good in the differences.</span> <span id="s225">That would have been incredibly consistent.</span> <span id="s226">I would have learned Iowa.</span> <span id="s227">In New York you had a conglomeration of every kind of person, even in those days.</span> <span id="s228">Maybe not the proportions as today, but certainly in the village, and this was in the village.</span> <span id="s229">It’s -- the village was the village, it may not have been what it has become since -- we’re talking for over -- over 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s230">So I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s231">I -- my parents bought me a bicycle.</span> <span id="s232">You recall a bicycle story from a different [indecipherable] tape that you had seen, and I rode around downtown Manhattan, all over God’s creation without any concerns, I mean, as long as I didn’t run into buses.</span> <span id="s233">And I learned about the community.</span> <span id="s234">I learned about the wharf, and I learned about the this and the that.</span> <span id="s235">And I was a curious George.</span> <span id="s236">I made friends with the man who ran the little hardware store across the street on -- on Hudson Street, because I was in there probably five times a week for things having to do with my bicycle, which needed to be polished, oiled, lubed, plugs changed daily.</span> <span id="s237">Slight exaggeration, but it was a very busy, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: You loved that bike.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: It -- it was -- it was my some sense of freedom, and I could do anything I pleased.</span> <span id="s242">I didn’t have a large number of friends at that point.</span> <span id="s243">Little later on, when we moved to the East Side, because we went into an apartment where we stayed for the rest of our time in New York, which was an old brownstone on 11th Street.</span> <span id="s244">I had two or three friends that I had some contact with, but we went to different schools.</span> <span id="s245">And life tends to be mostly going to school, and coming home, and having a little bit of time.</span> <span id="s246">And again, 50 years ago, the kind of freedom, I mean, none of the kids went for vacations in Fort Lauderdale, at least not then, and I was too young to do that on my own anyhow.</span> <span id="s247">But we went -- 14th Street in New York was still a major demarcation line between the lower East Side, and lower Manhattan, on -- further up.</span> <span id="s248">And we went to all the places.</span> <span id="s249">I remember taking -- taking -- I asked my parents to go to the movies with me, which they did.</span> <span id="s250">And we saw two and a half hours of cartoons.</span> <span id="s251">And I still don’t know how they survived that.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Can you describe how the transition was for your parents?</span> <span id="s253">Do you have much sense of that, of -- you said your father, within a year wanted to go to Philadelphia because he felt he would have more of a community.</span> <span id="s254">Was he having a hard time adjusting there, or was it just a function of the work wasn’t exactly what he wanted it to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: No, it’s not the work, the work was very much what he wanted.</span> <span id="s256">Community in that sense meant having friends that you could live in a neighborhood with, shopping that you did in a neighborhood when you knew the place, organizations where you got involved.</span> <span id="s257">New York is not that kind of a community.</span> <span id="s258">In a peculiar way, neither is Washington.</span> <span id="s259">But the cities of Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Boston, and so forth, have histories as -- Baltimore -- are communities.</span> <span id="s260">There are certain rules about them, there’s certain elements, and certain ebb and flow to them.</span> <span id="s261">And that’s what I meant he wanted a community.</span> <span id="s262">The position in New York, the job in New York, was a star position.</span> <span id="s263">I mean, this was the -- not quite, but it was the Metropolitan Opera version of the cantor at the -- the time.</span> <span id="s264">I mean, you appear once a month, and the rest of the time you can do anything you damn please.</span> <span id="s265">But he wanted to be based in someplace where he has some bricks, and some mortar, and some other kinds of roots that he can sink -- having now started his career for the third time.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Do you know how he --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Once in Europe, once in Israel, and once here.</span> <span id="s268">Yes?</span> <span id="s269">Q: How did he get that job?</span> <span id="s270">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes, he came on a -- he came not as a landed immigrant, he came with a visitor’s visa.</span> <span id="s272">How much detail do you want about how he stayed?</span> <span id="s273">If you’re interested, I’ll tell it to you briefly.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Tell me briefly, and then we can go.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: For whatever it’s worth, the cantor of the day was not a recognized minister of religion, the rabbi was.</span> <span id="s276">Rabbis had non-quota entry possibilities in terms of the Walter Maccaren Immigration act.</span> <span id="s277">A rabbi could come here, non-quota, bring his family, a cantor could not.</span> <span id="s278">My father had been ordained as a rabbi twice in Europe, at very respected ye -- Yeshivas, one of them in Bratislava, well known.</span> <span id="s279">It was never done for professional reasons.</span> <span id="s280">It was not at all unusual to have somebody become a ordained lawyer, physician, businessman, accountant, bookkeeper or chemist.</span> <span id="s281">In his field it wasn’t a bad idea to have that kind of background.</span> <span id="s282">My cousin -- my aunt’s son, who was a Philadelphia lawyer, with all the terms that that means, was able to research the law, and was able to find that as a ordained rabbi, no matter what he does for a living, he could enter non-quota.</span> <span id="s283">The rabbi of the congregation in New York, eventually gave him a position of being the associate rabbi so he could come.</span> <span id="s284">So I’m saying that that’s how he could stay in New York, and this happened before we arrived.</span> <span id="s285">How he got the job originally was that on a recommendation, he was asked to do a particular piece of -- of the liturgy, which happens once a month.</span> <span id="s286">It is called the Yom Kippur cattan.</span> <span id="s287">It is a -- every month there is a Yom Kippur that’s done -- not any more, but it used to be, and he performed that.</span> <span id="s288">He performed it as a volunteer, he performed it because somebody said, “Hey, you ought to listen to him.”</span> <span id="s289">And on that basis they decided to offer him position.</span> <span id="s290">I think he performed in other places as well, but he was able to get that without much difficulty, and as far as the job was concerned, and the income, that was fine.</span> <span id="s291">It was the community that was missing, and that was se -- that was given, or that was made available by the existence of Philadelphia -- remember, I had an aunt, an uncle, three cousins, and their families.</span> <span id="s292">So that came with an instant kind of a set of roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s294">So the transition to Philadelphia was not difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No.</span> <span id="s296">For me the transition to Philadelphia was not difficult.</span> <span id="s297">Certainly it was an easier transition than the previous several.</span> <span id="s298">You know, from Switzerland to a kibbutz, from a kibbutz to a city, from a city to New York.</span> <span id="s299">That was much more difficult.</span> <span id="s300">But no, I met sa -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Emanuel Mandel.</span> <span id="s302">This is tape number one , side B.</span> <span id="s303">You were saying when the tape cut off that you went to junior high school --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: That I met some friends in Philadelphia, in s -- in eighth grade, and one of them -- a couple of them, but really one of them is still my very best friend.</span> <span id="s305">Unfortunately he lives on the west coast.</span> <span id="s306">He’s a retarded pe -- a re -- retarded -- he’s a retired pediatrician.</span> <span id="s307">And Bill and I keep in close contact, and we expect to see him later this month, we’re going to be in San Francisco, and they were here last month.</span> <span id="s308">So, that’s a friendship that’s 50 years old, and we maintain it as well as we possibly can.</span> <span id="s309">And there were others, the other -- typically in 50 years, you’re not going to maintain your whole high school class.</span> <span id="s310">But the transition to Philly, to the best of my recollection, from that point of view, was easy.</span> <span id="s311">There were some other things that were difficult, probably with my educational background, and in some ways the lack of it, and what I saw probably subconsciously as my -- as my targets in life.</span> <span id="s312">Want me to continue on that direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Yeah, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Came to New York -- came from New York to Philadelphia, did okay in school, nothing unusual, however, interestingly, the neighborhood in which I lived, and for Philadelphians, all I have to say, I lived in Logan, and I eventually went to Central High School.</span> <span id="s315">Now, that’s a whole thing by itself, and that’s a keyword to anybody who knows Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s316">If you don’t, it doesn’t matter, and if you do, that’s a -- it’s the origin of the magnet school idea.</span> <span id="s317">It’s a city-wide school [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s318">That high school was equidistant to my house to the zoned high school that everybody from the neighborhood went to.</span> <span id="s319">My friends went to Central.</span> <span id="s320">They left junior high school -- in those days junior high school ended in ninth grade, I went to -- or eighth grade, but you could stay for ninth.</span> <span id="s321">You could start high school ninth or tenth.</span> <span id="s322">That’s significant, as I recall -- as I think back, that my friends went -- the two or three friends that I maintain contact with, went from Jaku Junior High School to Central in ninth grade.</span> <span id="s323">The counselor at that junior high school, Mr. Cotler by name, in his attempt to be kind and to be nice, said to us, “I would recommend that he go to Central High School, but next year.</span> <span id="s324">Ninth grade would be good for him in junior high school, because let’s face it, his English is not as perfect, his writing is not as perfect, I mean the kid has been here for a year.”</span> <span id="s325">It was one of the largest mistakes I ever made.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Because the whole style of the school was formed in ninth grade.</span> <span id="s328">When I arrived as one of maybe two or three newcomers to that class, to the 10th grade class, I was one of two, or three, or four kids who joined in 10th grade, everybody else was in ninth grade.</span> <span id="s329">And the adjustment, and the academics -- strictly academic high school.</span> <span id="s330">We had no non-academic course, it was the original high school wi -- where the Ford program, which later became the accelerated program, was introduced.</span> <span id="s331">I had major difficulties for two reasons.</span> <span id="s332">I think it took me awhile to catch up, and I spent summer schools in summer school because I had to make up one course or two.</span> <span id="s333">And secondly, I was very concerned -- not in a conscious way, of fitting in.</span> <span id="s334">As a consequence, the social and the -- not just social in terms of social with -- it’s a all boy’s high school, none of us minded that.</span> <span id="s335">Public school, all boys.</span> <span id="s336">It’s a whole other story.</span> <span id="s337">But the point is that I -- none of us missed the girls, so it wasn’t just a social with girls that we were trying to deal with at 14 and 15, which is the appropriate time to do that, but the other social things that take place among boys, [indecipherable] concerning sports, concerning various kinds of things that boys begin to become involved with, quite appropriately, was important for me to be part of.</span> <span id="s338">Well, you could only do so many things in 24 hours.</span> <span id="s339">As a consequence, I think that I would have had a -- an easier high school career had I gone during ninth grade, and if I wasn’t so conscious, at least subconsciously on adjusting to become one of the gang, where I didn’t do anything to become one, but it was certainly a drive, because I had recently been elsewhere, and I’d recently been different, quite different.</span> <span id="s340">And I -- I want to be sure that I say that in terms of my own experience, I wasn’t concerned about doing this in any conscious way, but I’m absolutely convinced in retrospect that in some way, I had a certain amount of catching up to do, which then slowed down some other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s342">How did your difficulties manifest itself?</span> <span id="s343">Just -- were you unhappy, were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s345">I don’t think -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Did you have trouble in -- in class?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I think that I did not do -- well, I know I -- I -- I think -- I didn’t do very well in high school, I was no scholarship student.</span> <span id="s348">I don’t think I was the smartest kid in class, nor the dumbest kid.</span> <span id="s349">I was an average kid.</span> <span id="s350">I understood.</span> <span id="s351">But somehow, when it came time to spend time on this or that, in terms of homework and other things, I spent less than I should have.</span> <span id="s352">Not at -- all the time, and not all -- every year.</span> <span id="s353">I had a marvelous high school experience.</span> <span id="s354">My three years in Central High School -- and I graduated from Central High School, were as important to me as any schooling, and that’s the only school I have any feelings about, in terms of wanting to have any kind of connection.</span> <span id="s355">I mean, I would consider going to next year’s 50th reunion.</span> <span id="s356">I certainly would not consider going to the reunion of Temple University, Penn State University, or the University of Pennsylvania, all of which I attended, and some of which even gave me a piece of sheepskin.</span> <span id="s357">I have no particular connection with them, or with it’s -- or with classmates.</span> <span id="s358">So Central is very important, it was a formative -- as it should be, but also a transformative time for me, because of where I came from, where I had been, and what I was.</span> <span id="s359">I remember only one kid that I can recall, who had an experience similar to mine, but I don’t know all the details of it, who also had been born overseas.</span> <span id="s360">Only one kid I can remember, in a school that because it was a city-wide school was quite eclectic in it’s combination of whites, blacks, Jews.</span> <span id="s361">Not -- I can’t recall any Hispanic kids, because there just weren’t any in Philly at the time, and not too many Oriental -- or Asian, or whatever you want to call, youngsters at the time, because there weren’t any.</span> <span id="s362">There were some, but not enormous numbers.</span> <span id="s363">It was a white, middle class school.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: How -- what was your -- what was your family life like during those years, and your parents, di -- did they become part of the community, the way your father wanted to do, and was that a significant thing for you at that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s366">Yes, in that I think my father in fact, was able to achieve what he wanted, and my mother with him, a sense of community involvement, and the -- all the various social and other kinds of organizations and things that -- and I’m not going to enumerate what it takes to be a member of a community, but we were not housebound, and we were active in this, that, and the other thing.</span> <span id="s367">And they -- my parents became involved in a association of survivors there, and all kinds of Jewish kinds of things.</span> <span id="s368">My father became very active in the cantor’s organizations, chairing the local group, eventually becoming the national president of the cantor’s assembly.</span> <span id="s369">This is after I left home, but he was very active, and very involved, and if you talk to any cantor today who is over the age of 50 -- cause the younger ones don’t know him, but the -- would know Yehudah Mandel.</span> <span id="s370">He was very well known, and very well respected, and did fine.</span> <span id="s371">The community, the synagogue was a major synagogue.</span> <span id="s372">Not a major synagogue, but a significant synagogue in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Because it had been there for 50 years, and it had a tradition that people came back to it even after they moved away.</span> <span id="s375">It was not one of the most prestigious, or one of the wealthiest synagogues, cause it was not in the wealthy part of town.</span> <span id="s376">Interestingly, it did not choose to rebuild in the suburbs.</span> <span id="s377">When it came time for the synagogue to essentially die, it was sold, and it’s holdings were transferred to another synagogue, so there was no second generation of that synagogue anywhere.</span> <span id="s378">It was built in ’24, I think, 1924.</span> <span id="s379">And in 1970-something, 50 years later, it just out -- ran out of it’s usefulness in that community, and it’s holdings were transferred to another synagogue in the city, not in the suburbs, actually.</span> <span id="s380">Philadelphia’s a very large, physical, geographic place.</span> <span id="s381">But it ceased to exist as a synagogue, but for the years my father was there, 35 years, it was.</span> <span id="s382">So that was very much so -- one of my limitations was that being from a observant family, there were many things I didn’t do.</span> <span id="s383">I didn’t go to the restaurants -- as little as people did, but I didn’t go to the hotdog stands, and I didn’t do this, and I didn’t do that, and I wasn’t available Friday night, and Saturday morning I didn’t go to the ballgame.</span> <span id="s384">There were things that I did not do, because they did, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s385">Eventually that changed to some degree, but there was always a little bit of an overtone, not a stigma --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Did you chafe against that in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Chafe, no, resent to some small degree, or found some restriction, yes.</span> <span id="s388">But then again, one of my f -- good friends lived across the street, was six foot three at the time.</span> <span id="s389">He chafed against being so tall, because that was unusual.</span> <span id="s390">The center of the basketball team was six the -- three, and today six foot three is a midget.</span> <span id="s391">So the question is how one chafes against things.</span> <span id="s392">I wouldn’t say I chafed against it, I think that I recognize it, and most of my buddies recognize it as well, and say, “Well, where are you going to be Friday?</span> <span id="s393">Oh, I -- I know you, Friday you have to be in synagogue, right?”</span> <span id="s394">“That’s right.”</span> <span id="s395">You know, you’re singing in the choir, your father’s choir, I did that for awhile, those kinds of things.</span> <span id="s396">So people understood.</span> <span id="s397">My circle of acquaintances, and the circle of acquaintances of my friends were in the Jewish community, 99 percent.</span> <span id="s398">I cannot remember being in the home of a non-Jewish kid in high school.</span> <span id="s399">And it was not a religious -- you know, it was not an observant th-thing, nor was there any kind of an injunction against.</span> <span id="s400">It’s just they weren’t part of our friendship groups.</span> <span id="s401">I didn’t have any black friends, lots of acquaintances, played on the teams with them, but I had no contact with them, they lived over there, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s402">Wherever that was, the over there.</span> <span id="s403">And the other differences were limited.</span> <span id="s404">I certainly had no church connection, which is where a -- my non-Jewish friends gathered, and various organizational things, and I didn’t go to Catholicism class, and I didn’t go to, you know, to mass.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Did you -- how did you identify yourself at that time?</span> <span id="s406">Did you think of yourself as an American right away, or did you -- did it take awhile for that to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: In some ways -- and again, I thought about this in terms of today’s conversation, in some ways I’m not sure I’ve ever consider myself labeled.</span> <span id="s408">There’s no question in my mind that everybody sees me, and I am in fact, and have been for the last 50 some years, an American, more so than anything else.</span> <span id="s409">But every once in awhile my good friend on the west coast will call me that crazy Hungarian kid.</span> <span id="s410">So there are some glitches in that perfect -- I mean, they’ll call my wife something, too, but they call her crazy New Jersey kid.</span> <span id="s411">At least that’s in this country.</span> <span id="s412">But there are some things that I’ve probably maintained -- retained, that I’m not even conscious of.</span> <span id="s413">I never -- and I repeat because it’s important for me to repeat to myself, I never consciously tried to acculturate, or to assimilate in anything that I did, by speech, or by dress, or by manner, or by behavior.</span> <span id="s414">That just happened.</span> <span id="s415">But I think underneath it there was always an element, and still is, of the first 10 years of my life, and the first eight years in Europe, the first 13 years overseas, and the subsequent years here.</span> <span id="s416">You want to remember also, that developmentally, a kid changes more in the first 15 years of his life.</span> <span id="s417">Once he gets to be kind of an adult, he tends to be the same for al -- as long as he lives.</span> <span id="s418">But the changes, the developmental tasks of infancy, childhood, and later of adolescence, and there are such things, kind of need to take place by the time you’re 18 - 19, or 20.</span> <span id="s419">And from that point on, you either are or you aren’t.</span> <span id="s420">And I hope I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: When you were approaching the end of high school, how did you think about your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Well, I was going to be an engineer.</span> <span id="s423">No question.</span> <span id="s424">If you look at my high school yearbook, it says, career path, engineer.</span> <span id="s425">Only problem was I had an --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: What did that mean to you, engineer, what kind of engineer?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Well, he tinkers.</span> <span id="s428">An engineer tinkers.</span> <span id="s429">I had no idea that an engineer sits behind a drafting board for two, or three, or four, or five years, in an engineering firm, going absolutely bonkers.</span> <span id="s430">When I began to become somewhat familiar with that, I said I don’t think I want to be an engineer.</span> <span id="s431">Aptitude-wise, apparently -- I mean, I don’t recall the particular scores, and cuda preference tests, and strong vocational tests and things of that nature.</span> <span id="s432">Tests with which I’m familiar for other reasons.</span> <span id="s433">I think I scored okay on math, and physics, and other kinds of things like that.</span> <span id="s434">But I really -- and I am sure that subconsciously again, by formative previous years, had something to do with, I thi -- I thought I wanted to go onto some kind of human services, not engineering services.</span> <span id="s435">And I thought I wanted to, in some way work with people, and not with things, which I did.</span> <span id="s436">And I transferred into a liberal arts program.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: In college?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Mm-hm, you started in an engineering program?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, the first year of any college, engineering or anything else, is the same thing, you take English 101, math 101, everything else 101, but in the first year.</span> <span id="s441">Now, what I did, I wanted to be very much independent in a sense of paying for school.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Now, one of the advantages I had, having come from Israel, and the background that I had, I was a Hebrew school teacher.</span> <span id="s444">Full time, which [indecipherable] 10 hours a week.</span> <span id="s445">Four to six four days a week, and 10 to 12 on Sunday.</span> <span id="s446">In that amount of 10 hours of work, I was able to make as much as some of my buddies who worked 20 or 30 hours in grocery stores, and after school jobs, because the rate was higher.</span> <span id="s447">I mean, I probably have earned as much as 900 dollars a year, but 900 dollars a year was two years worth of college, because my first year at Penn State, was 410 dollars, 205 dollars a semester.</span> <span id="s448">So I’m saying I was able to do what I wanted, namely pay for it myself.</span> <span id="s449">My parents, though they were getting to be a little bit more comfortable as time went on -- this is 1955, my father had been here five years, his salary was acceptable, he was teaching in the school, he did concerts, he did this, and appearances, and what.</span> <span id="s450">And I think that they were, economically, certainly comfortable, and remember, they didn’t spend a great deal of money eating out, because restaurants weren’t kosher, and it wasn’t the tradition.</span> <span id="s451">I mean, this is before the fast food avalanche, and everybody didn’t go out to fe -- Chinese food, you know, three times a week.</span> <span id="s452">I’m not sure they do it today either, but still.</span> <span id="s453">Anyhow, I was able to fund a certain amount of school, and I was able to then go to a school that was as close to being away from home as I could think of.</span> <span id="s454">Penn State University had campuses throughout the state, including one in oga -- at the Ogontz campus in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, commuting distance from my house.</span> <span id="s455">I had one in Eerie, and in Dubois.</span> <span id="s456">Several centers were you could go for two years, and then you have to transfer to the main campus at state college, or transfer to some other university.</span> <span id="s457">So for two years I had this idyllic life, from whatever in the morning, until three o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s458">At four o’clock I had to go teach.</span> <span id="s459">And I was out of school [indecipherable] that I would either drive up there, or my father would pick me up or something.</span> <span id="s460">It was arranged, and not a problem.</span> <span id="s461">But I had this idyllic life on this tiny little campus of maybe 300 kids.</span> <span id="s462">It had been the Ogontz School for Girls.</span> <span id="s463">And miss --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: O -- O - g - o - n - t - z, Ogontz, Indian name.</span> <span id="s465">It’s a section of Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s466">And Mrs. Sutherland, or Miss Sutherland, who had been the headmistress of the Ogontz school, lived on the property, in this little castle-like building, and she had rights to live there for the rest of her life.</span> <span id="s467">When she died, I don’t know what happened to the place.</span> <span id="s468">But this was -- and we had a gazebo, and a lake, and ducks.</span> <span id="s469">It was the most idyllic kind of life that you could think of, for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s470">Then reality kicked in, I was not going to go up to the campus, because I would have had to lose my teaching job.</span> <span id="s471">It was important to me.</span> <span id="s472">I transferred to Temple University when I finished the undergraduate work that I did.</span> <span id="s473">And Temple University in those days was 475 dollars a year.</span> <span id="s474">So again, I could afford that.</span> <span id="s475">But you ask about what I did in my first year.</span> <span id="s476">At Ogontz, at Penn State, I transferred -- I can’t remember now whether it was in the first semester, or the second semester.</span> <span id="s477">As I made out programs for my second year, I moved into -- more into the humanities, and into sociology, psychology and things.</span> <span id="s478">But even in your second year, things are pretty well -- re-requirements, you don’t have -- and this is 1955, this is not 1995, or 2005, where, you know, kids go to school and take one class a year, and then go back for basket weaving two.</span> <span id="s479">I mean, there are many jo -- they do this the high school, and in el -- in -- literally in the mel -- elementary school, the choices of curricula.</span> <span id="s480">Well, there were less choices, and in my second year, I don’t recall exactly, but I do remember that I moved away from the physical science, into the social science.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: And living at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Living at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: The whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Living at home, the whole time.</span> <span id="s485">Never a thought of living away from home.</span> <span id="s486">And I’ve often thought whether that was an issue of my choice, or I just couldn’t conceive -- I can tell you this much, that I certainly didn’t think of living away from home as an expression of independence.</span> <span id="s487">I was very independent at home, and I guess I had lived in enough different situations, that I didn’t have to prove the fact that I in fact could find my way on my own, by living away.</span> <span id="s488">And I think economically it was not a good idea.</span> <span id="s489">I mean, where was it going to go?</span> <span id="s490">There are some people in Philadelphia who lived at Penn -- University of Pennsylvania, who are city residents, you know, who lived a half an hour from the -- as people here live at college park.</span> <span id="s491">If I was in college these days, I never would commute.</span> <span id="s492">I’m sorry -- I would always commute, I would never be a resident student at college park.</span> <span id="s493">My kids were resident students at the universities, but they at least were outside of commuting distance.</span> <span id="s494">So my wife, interestingly, I mean just as a contrast, although this -- it’s no impact on me, I hardly knew her then, commuted to school, although she had a scholarship to attend any university -- any state university in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s495">She was [indecipherable] she had a Regent’s scholarship.</span> <span id="s496">She could have gone to New Brunswick, from the Newark area where she was raised, and been a resident student.</span> <span id="s497">Because of a number of things, she chose to live at home.</span> <span id="s498">So interesting, we were both commuting students as undergraduates.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s500">During these years -- first couple years of college, and you’re still working every day, teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You’re still thinking about what it is you’re going to do, you haven’t completely -- that idea hasn’t really formed in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I wish I could identify for you at what point I began to make more of a concerted direction decision.</span> <span id="s504">Probably when I wo -- when I transferred -- when I finished two years at Penn State, and as I said, I couldn’t stay there any longer, I had to either transfer to the main campus at college park, or transfer to any place else that would accept me, and I was [indecipherable] acceptable things.</span> <span id="s505">I transferred to Temple University, which is the commuting school in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s506">And I’m trying to think of whether it was a particular teacher, or particular curriculum that got me involved in what was another Ford Foundation trial program.</span> <span id="s507">I am currently, and have for the last 45 years been a professional social worker.</span> <span id="s508">I’ve been in private practice now for 20 years.</span> <span id="s509">I say that because that’s where I got to because of what I decided then.</span> <span id="s510">There was some kind of a program in the school of education department of secondary education, which combined majors in sociology, psychology, political science, history and economics.</span> <span id="s511">That attracted me, as a -- this kind of a [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s512">Now, at the end of that completion, you could practice teaching, become a teacher, which I did not do.</span> <span id="s513">My undergraduate degree is as a bachelor of science in education.</span> <span id="s514">I was a qualified, but not certified teacher in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s515">Had I practiced ott, I would have become certified, I think, in history or something.</span> <span id="s516">So that attracted me, the choice was to do that, and the other choice was to go to school of social work in graduate programs.</span> <span id="s517">And at the time there was really only one school in Philadelphia, that was the University of Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s518">As this is going on, and I think back to a couple of people at the university, who were instrumental in talking with me about these things, and these are programs that some of the courses had practicums attached, in the field of social service, in the field of social welfare, in the field of social work.</span> <span id="s519">I began to think more and more in relation to maybe doing that.</span> <span id="s520">I knew I’d have to go to graduate school, which didn’t bother me conceptually.</span> <span id="s521">I was a little worried about the fact that the United States army might interfere.</span> <span id="s522">And I was very concerned if my career in school is interrupted, will I go back to school afterwards, and there’s no way to guarantee that, I took the deferment exam, I did everything I could.</span> <span id="s523">I wouldn’t say that I had a daughter for that purpose, but that didn’t hurt, because here I was 23 years old or something, or whatever, and with a wife and a family, and I had to sign a commitment up to the age of 35, but I wasn’t drafted.</span> <span id="s524">There was a reason why I wasn’t drafted, which is nothing to do with my choices.</span> <span id="s525">Informationally, as another one of the homogenizing elements in my life, at Penn State, it being a land grant institution, it required all freshmen, and sophomore men to participate in reserve officers training program, ROTC, in World War two uniforms.</span> <span id="s526">So Wednesdays, I was Lieutenant Mandel of the horse cadets.</span> <span id="s527">As a consequence, because I was in a military program, quote unquote, I was skipped when my draft number came up -- not the lottery, this precedes the lottery.</span> <span id="s528">This is right after Korea, and the calls were limited.</span> <span id="s529">You know, two or three people per draft board.</span> <span id="s530">So they never called me, and by the time I got done with this, two years later, all the 18 and 19 year olds were ahead of me on the list, so I was never called, I was never ca -- I w -- took an army physical, I was a one-A, and I did all the things in those days that all of us did.</span> <span id="s531">Some of my friends signed up on various pr-plans, they would postpone induction until they finished school and then go in.</span> <span id="s532">Some took a six month program to get done with the active service, and then go to reserve meetings for seven years.</span> <span id="s533">I did neither, and lucked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: At what age did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: The rules stated that you could become a citizen at 18 on your own if you had been here for five years.</span> <span id="s538">If you were here for five years before you were 18, you could become a citizen on your parent’s papers.</span> <span id="s539">But I was sworn in to this da -- the federal court in Philadelphia in December of 1954 -- ’54, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Was that a significant, memorable moment for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I gotta tell you that I have to think about it, because I haven’t thought about it daily.</span> <span id="s542">I’ll tell you two things about the day.</span> <span id="s543">One, I certainly felt more American that day, not because of the swearing in, but because who else was being sworn in.</span> <span id="s544">I was, as I remember, the only recently graduated high school kid being sworn, everybody else was older.</span> <span id="s545">There were two guys who were in Air Force uniforms, who had to renounce their titles in the Czech royalty.</span> <span id="s546">They couldn’t be Count PFC, they had to be Mr. PFC. There was a rule, you cannot hold a title in the States, but they were already in the Air Force, or maybe the army -- I think in the Air Force.</span> <span id="s547">I -- but there were other people were there, they were all older now, and older probably by three, four, five years, or 30 years, but not anybody my age, and I was an American kid for whom this was a right of passage, no problem.</span> <span id="s548">I didn’t have any difficulties with the three questions they asked me, which may have been what’s the highest court in the country, and what are the highest legislative bodies in Washington?</span> <span id="s549">Remember, I was living in Philly, not in Washington.</span> <span id="s550">It was an easy th -- it was a non -- i -- it was a non -- how do -- it was not, as I remember it, an emotionally important kind of thing.</span> <span id="s551">I didn’t have my parents with me.</span> <span id="s552">I didn’t go to their swearing in.</span> <span id="s553">It was a routine that you had to do, like renew your driver’s license.</span> <span id="s554">It was equally emotional, because I felt so very comfortable with where I was, and how I went, and who I was, and what I knew in terms of the American life.</span> <span id="s555">It wasn’t a sheltered existence in my own self-made ghetto, whatever ghetto that is, as many people do.</span> <span id="s556">I’d been involved in the swearing in ceremonies here, because of a commission I served on at one time.</span> <span id="s557">And it’s interesting to see the people now, that’s a very different world, but still you see the ghettos that come.</span> <span id="s558">The Thai community comes to the swearing in of it’s Thai people, and the Cambodians to the Cambodians, and to the Salvadorians to the Salvadorians.</span> <span id="s559">I didn’t feel that I was a member of any of those communities.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: That’s interesting, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: But I really -- I have to tell you I’ve not thought about -- I know it was December 1954, and I re-remember the -- the -- the U.S. court, but I don’t remember anything about it that would have been remarkable.</span> <span id="s562">Maybe the word is unremarkable, to me.</span> <span id="s563">But again, I was the only kid that I can remember, there was a high school -- just recently graduated high school kid, I guess I was at Penn State, I don’t reca -- call what day it was.</span> <span id="s564">Obviously took the day, and I took care of it.</span> <span id="s565">But I didn’t make any kind of a thing about it.</span> <span id="s566">As I said, my parents didn’t come with me, not because they had to take me, but because it wasn’t that -- important yes, significant, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s568">During these years, were your parents weighing in with thoughts about what you should do in college, or were those decisions left pretty much up to you?</span> <span id="s569">Did you discuss those kinds of things with your parents very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I’m sure I did, and I’m sure that it was a non-significant discussion.</span> <span id="s571">I know that my father said to me when I was at graduate school, he says, “I don’t know what social workers do, but I have a feeling that it may not be the most lucrative thing for anybody to do.</span> <span id="s572">So I have a recommendation.</span> <span id="s573">Start on your second million.</span> <span id="s574">Takes all the pressure off making the first.”</span> <span id="s575">Right?</span> <span id="s576">I took up his advice, and I’ve done exactly what he told me.</span> <span id="s577">But I have no -- social services, human kind of work, that kind of stuff was understood.</span> <span id="s578">In those days the interest in working was for some agency type occupation, not the private practice that I do now, or the independent practice, where I see independent patients on my own office.</span> <span id="s579">And that was understood, because lots of folks, and lots of community positions had that kind of background.</span> <span id="s580">And the difference was this job was different than that job, but that kind of training was similar.</span> <span id="s581">And look, my father had been in communal kind of involvement for a long time, he was very active in the chaplaincy.</span> <span id="s582">Bumped into social workers all over the place, and all the veterans in all the regular hospitals.</span> <span id="s583">He was the chaplaincy’s chaplain.</span> <span id="s584">My mother was involved -- grew up in a home that was community based.</span> <span id="s585">Her father was the rabbi of the community.</span> <span id="s586">The one rabbi in the community of 3000 Jews in Novisad.</span> <span id="s587">So this was not something that was on Mars.</span> <span id="s588">But I have no recollection really.</span> <span id="s589">I think my parents were very interested in my finishing school.</span> <span id="s590">I think they were very concerned that would I finish on what terms, because they obviously were aware that my high school career was not brilliant.</span> <span id="s591">It was not the kind that schools were chasing me with scholarship offers.</span> <span id="s592">I mean, I finished -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Emanuel Mandel.</span> <span id="s594">This is tape number two, side A. Your parents didn’t really pressure you in any specific direction as you were deciding what you would do, as you were in college.</span> <span id="s595">Was there ever any thought that you would move in a -- in a more religious direction, that you would go become a rabbi, or a cantor?</span> <span id="s596">Was there -- did your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: That’s a terrific question.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: -- want you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: They did not push me vocationally in any direction.</span> <span id="s600">They did push me educationally, because they thought it was important to attain a certain status of having earned a degree, that was important.</span> <span id="s601">As far as specifically, I think that they would have been -- my father particularly would have been happy if I had been more involved in some religious life avocationally, although I don’t think he would have necessarily recommended the rabbinate, and don’t misunderstand, and the listener shouldn’t misunderstand, that he had some feeling that that’s a lousy job for a nice Jewish kid, in some ways.</span> <span id="s602">It ha -- this -- th-the politics of the rabbinate is not -- no, the rabbinate is not without politics, okay?</span> <span id="s603">The cantor has a different element.</span> <span id="s604">The cantor requires, at least by his judgment and mine, a certain talent which I did not possess.</span> <span id="s605">I was not blessed with a voice, as he and many others.</span> <span id="s606">He could learn everything.</span> <span id="s607">But the performance piece requires the talent, and I didn’t score well on that.</span> <span id="s608">I sang in his choir until my voice changed kind of, and -- and I’m still, at this point, very interested in the cantorate, and varying s -- music, and the only thing I play is the radio.</span> <span id="s609">So, no I -- th-the question is good, and they would have been pleased, but I don’t think that he’d -- they really thought that if I am involved in some kind of communal service of a Jewish nature, that’s close, that’s close, and it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And that was the assumption, that it would be i-in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I think so, I think so.</span> <span id="s612">And it was, in fact.</span> <span id="s613">I don’t know if that was because it was so directed, or because I saw no cha -- no choice anywhere else, it was not that I didn’t see choices anywhere else.</span> <span id="s614">If I hadn’t been involved in a scholarship program, in Jewish communal service, given by the B’nai Brith, which funded my graduate school, and then I owed them some time, I would have been very interested in going into a different element of human services.</span> <span id="s615">In fact, in the -- in -- as a social worker, yes, but in the rehabilitation.</span> <span id="s616">In that -- and I did an internship, or an externship at the wa -- hospital in Philadelphia, and I was very interested in being involved in the elements of helping people adjust to the dite -- activities of daily life, now without a hand, or now with a major disability.</span> <span id="s617">Because the point is you don’t put them into -- onto -- put them on a shelf, and make them not participate.</span> <span id="s618">Now, there’s got to be some acknowledgement for the fact that they may not be the same.</span> <span id="s619">I mean, blind folks are not going to be pilots, rights or no rights.</span> <span id="s620">But, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing else they can do.</span> <span id="s621">And that whole element of that kind of retraining, and re-understanding of the psychological dynamics of being disabled, fascinated me, included the physical elements of it.</span> <span id="s622">And I would have gone into that element of things, as many others that I had thought about, if I hadn’t had a Jewish commitment.</span> <span id="s623">And in fact, a guarantee that I have to take a job for two years, because I have to repay them for their having given me a scholarship to University of Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s624">So yes, the Jewish element was there, the Jewish vocation element specifically, in terms of rabbinate or cantor, it was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: You said that your parents joined a survivor’s group early on, I -- I can’t remember if it was in New York, or when they first got --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Philly.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: In Philly.</span> <span id="s628">You must have known about those meetings, did you take --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: -- take part in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Well, not that much.</span> <span id="s632">What happened is that there is a World Federation of Hungarian Jury, I think is it’s name, in New York.</span> <span id="s633">My father knew some of the people there.</span> <span id="s634">My father knew lots of people, and lots of places, and he used those contacts for appropriate things.</span> <span id="s635">And my father tells me again I’m digressing on him, but it’s interesting that he went to call on a person as a matter of courtesy, not because he was a supporter, but because of what he stood, what -- what he represented, who at that time lived in Brooklyn, and was one of the major enemies of Israel.</span> <span id="s636">This was the Sotmire rabbe from Sotmire, Hungary, Rabbi Oyle Titlebaum, who my father knew in Sotmire, which is in the general area of Ruthinia where my father was raised.</span> <span id="s637">And he called on the rabbe, as an acknowledgement of the rabbe’s achievement in the ra -- in the rabbe business, as a scholar, not as a political entity.</span> <span id="s638">But he is the leader of the Sotmire Hassidim, and he’s not gone, but when he went to Israel, they changed the ne -- the notation on the trains from the state of Israel to cover it up, because after all, since this was not created by the Messiah, it did not exist.</span> <span id="s639">And Titlebaum would have given Israel to Abdullah, and wait for the Messiah to come to create the state.</span> <span id="s640">So, clearly there was no agreement on the politics, but my father call on -- now why did he call on him?</span> <span id="s641">He knew him from there, and Titlebaum was with us in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s642">He was one of the 1600.</span> <span id="s643">So there are many people that you tend to know, but to get back to -- to the issue that’s closer to home --</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Did you participate in those activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Right.</span> <span id="s646">The World Federation hungar -- of Hungarian -- of -- Association of Hungarian [indecipherable] was in New York, and knew some people from before.</span> <span id="s647">They, my father and some others, started an organization called the Hungarian Hebrew Association of Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s648">It was not necessarily of survivors, or a survivor organization, but by definition 98 percent of them were survivors.</span> <span id="s649">And they had the fundraisers, and they had programs, and they had concerts, and they sponsored Israel bonds, and they sponsored Jewish National Fund, they sponsored the forest in Israel, and other kinds of things.</span> <span id="s650">So this was an element of not a survivor organization, but an organization of Hungarian Jews, who by definition were -- I don’t know about 98 percent, but substantially either survivors, or people with survivor families who may have come here before the war, so they were not survivors, quote unquote, but they were in fact part of the same community.</span> <span id="s651">And he was very active in that, and I was involved in -- in my way, I mean the picking up and the dropping off of packages, the rummage sales.</span> <span id="s652">I’m not sure I attended too many of the meetings, I certainly went to their programs.</span> <span id="s653">They would get together and they would cook potluck dinners, enormous ones for the community, and my mother was again involved in the cooking for large numbers, cause she knew something about how do you do whatever Hungarian cooking type things for 200, not for three.</span> <span id="s654">And whatever they were, whether it was sour cabbage or some other things, and again this was usually done at the synagogue, where my father had certain privileges.</span> <span id="s655">He could rent easily enough, and make arrangements for making it available, and he would pay a rent, and they would have programs, and that was something they did.</span> <span id="s656">My involvement in that was limited, but clearly I was involved in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Your father then -- and y -- both of your parents, their professional and social lives were very much bound up in the community, as he --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: -- as he wa -- as he had wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: His, my mother had no professional life any more, she didn’t have any professional life since she -- really since the time she was married, although she had a little bit afterwards.</span> <span id="s661">She’d been an enent -- elementary school teacher for kiddies in southern Hungary, and she taught in Temerin, which is a city not far from Novisad.</span> <span id="s662">I don’t know if she taught for three, or four years, maybe five, I don’t recall the exact numbers.</span> <span id="s663">They were married in 1930.</span> <span id="s664">My mother was 24 year -- 22 years old, so she couldn’t have taught -- well, she taught some years after that until left Novisad -- maybe four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: And was there involvement more to sort of be part of that community, and maintain the ki -- the welfare of that community, or -- how political was it at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: In Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Political in the sense of the politics in terms of American politics, in terms of wa -- the republicans and the democrats, zilch and zip, none.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I would suspect they may have known.</span> <span id="s671">I certainly could not tell you who represented me in the state house in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s672">I recall vaguely who the congressman may have been, and the senators, and the mayor, and the governor.</span> <span id="s673">But only vaguely, I mean, I can remember.</span> <span id="s674">Have to think about the era.</span> <span id="s675">The involvement, or the household involvement of the organization, and the involvement of my parents with these, was at best cursory.</span> <span id="s676">I don’t remember -- the only place I remember going to a political meeting was in New Jersey where wif -- my wife is from, we went to -- he’s of the past, he’s not gone, he became a senator, he lost his senatorial position as part of ABSCAM, Harrison Williams, known as Pete Williams, who was a congressman from New Jers -- was running initially in 1950 something or other, and we went to a rally in Hillside, New Jersey, where my wife is from.</span> <span id="s677">I -- I’m sure that was the first political event I went to in my life of that kind.</span> <span id="s678">But I had no involvement in politics, and neither did my parents, and neither did anybody else that I knew, in those days.</span> <span id="s679">As I say, I could not tell you who represented us in Harrisburg, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: So no, like pro-Israel kind of involvement?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: No, no, but that’s not the me -- you’re talking -- I’m talking about American politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: The Israel issue is not a political one.</span> <span id="s684">That’s an emotional one.</span> <span id="s685">It is alway -- there’s a familial -- I mean, we send packages, we had communication, we had some visits.</span> <span id="s686">I mean, I went back to Israel for the first time since I came in 1957, as did my parents.</span> <span id="s687">We went separately, but we met there.</span> <span id="s688">I then again went in -- in ’57 -- in ’60, I went, I don’t know, half a dozen times, or a dozen times since.</span> <span id="s689">But the connection is -- was very clear, but it was not a political one.</span> <span id="s690">It was not a support of labor, or a support of hashomir atsyere, or a support later of Leecould.</span> <span id="s691">It was not a political involvement on their part.</span> <span id="s692">I would think -- since Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had an open primary system, you could vote for any party you wished, I would suspect that they registered democrats.</span> <span id="s693">I certainly was, and I think that had to do with who was, in fact, representing.</span> <span id="s694">I mean, this was the era when Truman had been an important guy, and then came Eisenhower, and then came Stevenson as a candidate, and then came Kennedy.</span> <span id="s695">In that milieu -- Kennedy’s the first president I voted for -- in that milieu, democratic party seemed like the thing I wanted to be involved with, because I couldn’t find any kind of connection with the republicans, though the Philadelphia, the -- the -- the -- the governor of Pennsylvania was a republican, and Philadelphia had a long, long -- a republican mayor, until 50 something or other.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s697">Let’s go back to we’re about to graduate from college.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: And you’ve met your w -- wife-to-be -- in college, is that where you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Nope, nope, nope.</span> <span id="s703">Nothing to do with college.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s705">Did you graduate then, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Well, I did, but do you want to go on the -- on the -- on college, you want to tell -- me to tell you about how I met my wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Well, wha -- how -- tell me about your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Then the-there’s no connection there.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Okay, tell me about how you met your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: I became active with some of my buddies in the B’nai Brith youth organization, a program called AZA, Aleph Zadik Aleph.</span> <span id="s711">It was a -- you don’t even know about it?</span> <span id="s712">Q: No, I’m not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Well, but I thought you might have known from these --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: I’m thinking that -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: -- descriptions.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: -- no, no, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: You are familiar with the B’nai Brith --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: -- as an organization?</span> <span id="s720">It sponsored a youth organization for boys, and one for girls.</span> <span id="s721">It was the largest organization of it’s type in the country.</span> <span id="s722">I went to work for them, eventually, in terms of my Jewish commitment.</span> <span id="s723">She was a member of it -- of the girl’s organization in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s724">Philadelphia, ne -- Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia and Delaware were in the same district.</span> <span id="s725">We had conventions, we had get-togethers, we had various things.</span> <span id="s726">And s -- in December of ’53, I think, there was a program of -- a weekend program in Philadelphia during Christmas break, and the presidents of the district honored us with their presence.</span> <span id="s727">The boy’s president was a young man by the name of Eliot Rothman, who was an architect in Boston, with whom we’re still in close contact, and guess who the girl’s president was?</span> <span id="s728">The woman whom you met this morning, my wife.</span> <span id="s729">And Adrienne and Eliot came to give out diplomas for this university weekend that we had attended.</span> <span id="s730">It was not university, it was still high school at the time, but there was a program called the university.</span> <span id="s731">And actually I met her.</span> <span id="s732">I met her and many others, and we communicated, and corresponded, and occasionally visited.</span> <span id="s733">We had no social contact.</span> <span id="s734">She went her way, I went my way.</span> <span id="s735">In 1956, after we’d known each other as friends for a couple of years -- as I say in those days you didn’t make phone calls every day, you -- occasionally a phone call, sometimes a visit, and some letters -- we met up again at the camp in the summertime, we both went there as adults, we were 20, to supervise a convention -- well, part of a convention.</span> <span id="s736">And I think we had some kind of thoughts about each other throughout all this time, but we had never had a date, or a connection.</span> <span id="s737">I don’t think that she and I were ever alone for an hour at the time.</span> <span id="s738">With lots of other kids, yes.</span> <span id="s739">She was involved with some kid from college, and I was involved with some girl from someplace else, and we had active social lives.</span> <span id="s740">In ’56 we decided that maybe there’s something we ought to think about more seriously, and we did.</span> <span id="s741">In ’57, we both went to Europe, separately, and the place where we rendezvoused by schedule, was in Venice, which is not a place in which to rendezvous, both socially or romantically.</span> <span id="s742">And in ’58 we were married.</span> <span id="s743">But we met unrelated to school, she went to Rutgers University in Newark, I went to Temple University in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s744">Schools had nothing to do with our connection at any point.</span> <span id="s745">And she moved to Philadelphia with me while I was in graduate school.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: She have survivors in her family?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Her parents were born here, her grandparents -- her grandparents came from the other side, from Europe, three out of the four, but they came as young people, before the first World War.</span> <span id="s750">So survivors -- she had some aunts.</span> <span id="s751">But -- and she had a cousin, her mother’s cousin, Alex. But no, no real survivor connection.</span> <span id="s752">I may have been the first one that she really met.</span> <span id="s753">Was a kid in school she talks about who arrived at her, maybe junior high school, who came from Europe, and everybody was nice to her, and they gave her special help, and taught her English and things.</span> <span id="s754">But limited.</span> <span id="s755">You also have to have some understanding of the nature of the community.</span> <span id="s756">Hillside, New Jersey was kind of an enclave outside of Newark, between Newark and Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s757">But no, I would say that her involvement with survivors, even though she may disagree to some degree, was at best limited.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: And did that cause any difficulty between you?</span> <span id="s759">Was there any bridge to gap?</span> <span id="s760">Any gap to bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I don’t think the survivor thing has -- was the gap.</span> <span id="s762">I think the difference in some upbringing, the religious difference -- she comes from a essentially sectarian home, Jewish but sectarian, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s763">I think that the differences in where we spent the first 12 - 15 years of our lives -- I mean, her notion of the war was that they had air raid alerts in school, and they crawled under the desk.</span> <span id="s764">My notion of the same time was air raids.</span> <span id="s765">There’s a difference.</span> <span id="s766">And that difference, I think, has -- had been there -- ha -- has been there, is there, and will be there.</span> <span id="s767">And we’ve been together for a very long time.</span> <span id="s768">I mean, we’re -- 1958 is now what, 47 years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: There’s so many stories you hear about people who came to this country, and me-meeting American Jews, who have no understanding of what they’ve been through, and how that sometimes caused friction and difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Was that a problem for you before you met your wife, and -- and -- or were there any kind of incidents that you remember along those lines, about, you know, American Jews not understanding what you’d been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I don’t think so --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Or you thinking that they should, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I don’t think so at the time, because of the difference between myself and the adult community.</span> <span id="s775">I think my parents experienced that much more so than the kid community, who kind of went with the flow.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I mean, my buddies knew this, that, and the other thing, and didn’t care about the rest, and didn’t -- I didn’t accuse them of not having been in concentration camp, and they didn’t hold me accountable for having been there.</span> <span id="s778">Not among kids, and I’m talking about kids now up to the age of, you know, college age.</span> <span id="s779">Adults, something else, their sense of establishment when they came, what they did, why they didn’t help, the whole issue about Roosevelt and various emissaries, and the interest that the national government had, and what they had to do, and [indecipherable] the first to recognize that the first interest had to be the protection of this country.</span> <span id="s780">But that doesn’t mean they couldn’t have had something to do with other things as well.</span> <span id="s781">But there’s a whole issue involved with who they were, what they were, what thi -- their upbringing was.</span> <span id="s782">But I’m saying -- the question that you ask I think relates with my parent’s generation, not to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: I can’t recall anything that will be significant that I can tell you, where this -- this rub, this -- this chafing, as you said earlier, was of issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Mm-hm, for you.</span> <span id="s786">Do you know of specific incidents about your parents experience along those lines?</span> <span id="s787">I mean, was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No.</span> <span id="s789">No, well, specific, no.</span> <span id="s790">I think that there were issues having to do with the fact that anybody who didn’t come here on the Mayflower, and nobody I knew came on the Mayflower, was seen as -- the reference being a greener, a newcomer.</span> <span id="s791">And that came up once in awhile.</span> <span id="s792">Certainly my father had that because the kind of life that he had to start all over with for the third time, was not the kind of life that he had in th-the first time.</span> <span id="s793">And in some ways he resented that, and to some degree he expected things of people in terms of performance, in terms of responsibility, that he thought was appropriate to expect.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: I don’t -- can you be more specific about what you mean?</span> <span id="s795">He expected what kinds of things from people?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: He expected -- well, you have to know something about him as well, which I’m not going to detail for you, but the point is he expected certain behavior norms, and cert -- if somebody said I’m going to do this, he should do it, not forget it.</span> <span id="s797">This has nothing to do with being an immigrant, but it has to do with the fact that when he was in Europe, and was the chief cantor of Budapest, essentially if he barked, somebody said yes.</span> <span id="s798">And here he was not that, but the expectation may have been the same.</span> <span id="s799">If some of his colleagues said they will do this or that, or the other thing, and bring this piece of music to that rehearsal, he expected that.</span> <span id="s800">And if they didn’t, it had something to do with him personally, but also with the fact that he did not -- he did not suffer fools well, cause he never had to.</span> <span id="s801">I think that he had some feelings about the fact that when he was looking for a position in Philadelphia, he had occasions to go to various places, and to essentially go for tryouts.</span> <span id="s802">And he was resentful of the fact, for example, that one rabbi said to him -- rabbi came from the same neighborhood that he did in Europe, but came 20 years before, he said to him, “Well, you know, cantor, in this congregation, the cantor does the responsive readings in English.”</span> <span id="s803">To which my father said, you know, I mean, “Is that what you want me to do?</span> <span id="s804">I mean, you have now just said the weakest part of my armament is what you want me to feature.</span> <span id="s805">I mean, I can speak English, I can read English, but I have reasonably difficult accent, and this is not my -- I mean, I’ll do it in German, I’ll do it in Hebrew, I’ll do it in Russian, but I won’t do it in English, because again, it’ll embarrass me, and it’ll embarrass you.”</span> <span id="s806">“Well, if you can’t do that, we can’t give you the job.”</span> <span id="s807">And he thought that there was an element of saying, uh-uh, I made it, you ain’t.</span> <span id="s808">And that was a resent thing against the newcomer.</span> <span id="s809">It may have also been a resentment against my father’s skills and abilities, which may have been threatening to some others.</span> <span id="s810">And he was an outstanding cantor, and if that sounds like a chauvinistic statement, it isn’t, alright?</span> <span id="s811">An enormous voice, was very well trained, and it scared the hell out of folks who weren’t.</span> <span id="s812">You know?</span> <span id="s813">Who were legends only in their own minds, and he was not, but [inaudible].</span> <span id="s814">So there are things like that.</span> <span id="s815">We came from central Europe.</span> <span id="s816">The majority of the Jewish community in this country came from eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s817">My mother was not Yiddish speaking.</span> <span id="s818">I don’t know if you know, but Yiddish was not spoken everywhere in Europe.</span> <span id="s819">My grandfather knew Yiddish very well.</span> <span id="s820">My father knew Yiddish very well, because when they went to Yeshiva, which is the original schooling thing, you learned in Yiddish, you learned -- you learned Bible, which is written in Hebrew, discussing it in Yiddish, not in Hebrew, because you didn’t use the Hebrew language for secular conversation.</span> <span id="s821">It’s a holy language, it’s only for study.</span> <span id="s822">And you discussed it in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s823">So they knew Yiddish, they spoke Yiddish at home.</span> <span id="s824">Much of the community that you see here, that came from Poland and Russia had Yiddish in their homes.</span> <span id="s825">In New York my mother was told any number -- she wasn’t told, it was told about her that she doesn’t even speak a proper language.</span> <span id="s826">How can the cantor’s wife not speak a proper language?</span> <span id="s827">What’s the proper language?</span> <span id="s828">Yiddish.</span> <span id="s829">So those were things that they had to do with the fact that she didn’t speak a proper language, she didn’t come from the right place, and she didn’t come when we came.</span> <span id="s830">These kinds of things.</span> <span id="s831">Are they serious?</span> <span id="s832">No.</span> <span id="s833">Are they significant?</span> <span id="s834">Somewhat.</span> <span id="s835">Impact?</span> <span id="s836">Some.</span> <span id="s837">Critical?</span> <span id="s838">No.</span> <span id="s839">That’s the valuation I can give you about the impact of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: You finished school, you had this two year commitment, and what -- where did you go, what -- what kind of work did you do when you finished school?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: I had a choice to -- well, I had to take a position with the B’nai Brith youth organization as a professional member of the staff.</span> <span id="s842">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: And I had a choice -- if not a choice, a 55 - 45 choice, so it was not a total choice, but a choice still, of taking a position in the Philadelphia office, or taking a position in the Cleveland office.</span> <span id="s845">I went to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s846">I really thought that I wanted to have a career start not in my hometown, for all the blessings of the hometown, and all the negatives of the hometown.</span> <span id="s847">I went to Cleveland for two years.</span> <span id="s848">While in Cleveland, a position opened up in Detroit, which is no more attractive than Cleveland, but it was in a different district, with a different staff, with a different supervisor, with a different boss than Chicago, and it would -- and it was the top job in the state of Michigan, and I was interested in that, to see if I could do that.</span> <span id="s849">And I got that job, and as a consequence, I stayed well beyond my two year commitment, and I stayed with them for 15 years.</span> <span id="s850">And I was with the agency totally for 15 years, Cleveland and Michigan -- well, even before, I was even in New Jersey for a little time.</span> <span id="s851">But I stayed with the B’nai Brith organization as a professional social worker.</span> <span id="s852">They used to hire group workers in those days, which I was, and I ran a program for healthy, well-adjusted middle class Jewish kids in the state of Michigan.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: What kind of program?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: It’s a social, educational, religious, athletic program after school.</span> <span id="s855">They meet in groups called chapters, very much like I was involved as a kid in a chapter in Philadelphia, my wife in a chapter in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s856">And we would have gatherings, and -- where we met, and others met, and I had not the same, but similar programs, in Michigan, and programs in the district, which was the larger area of the Midwest, and programs which were national, which was in the national encampment, which happens to be in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s857">You know, it’s a home turf for me again, but that’s a -- it could have been in -- went to conventions the University of Illinois, where we in fact, took the university at Champagne, for a convention of several hundred kids from that district.</span> <span id="s858">That was a large program divided throughout the country into seven different districts, and the details of that are not important.</span> <span id="s859">No longer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: And you’re -- you were married by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: We were married -- yeah sure, we were married ’58, went to -- I was married all through graduate school.</span> <span id="s862">My daughter was born in ’60, we went to Cleveland in ’61, went to Detroit in ’63, came here in ’73 --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Oh, so that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: -- to Washington, right.</span> <span id="s865">With the same organization to be the third man in the national office, which was terrific in terms of my having come to Washington, I’ve never regretted that.</span> <span id="s866">But after three years here, or two years, the national office, for many, many reasons I thought that’s not what I want to do.</span> <span id="s867">Continue in there sometimes needs to be a -- not so much a vocational change, but maybe an employment change.</span> <span id="s868">And we came to a mutual meeting of separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: And you became a private --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Nots -- not quite --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: -- I went to work for the -- I mean, the largest employer in this community is the federal government.</span> <span id="s873">I went to work at a private agency in southeast Washington for two years with a friend of mine, which was totally funded by government contract, and that kind of petered out because of a number of things that happened, including a change in administration.</span> <span id="s874">I went to work for the Peace Corps, here in town, as a trainer, particularly in areas of psychological kinds of issues, and counseling kinds of services to be given -- this is only to the staff of the Peace Corps, I never had anything with volunteers, but they would work with volunteers.</span> <span id="s875">I’d -- rec -recognition of cultural difference, I mean you have a Peace Corps vol -- Peace Corps staff member is going to be the agricultural staff member in west Africa.</span> <span id="s876">He knows the agricultural business, but if you ask him about cultural differences, you have to first define the word culture, cause he never seen anything, besides Montana.</span> <span id="s877">Whatever, I’m not maligning Montana.</span> <span id="s878">Culture in this country, I mean remember, this is a country where you can go for 3,000 miles with one language, with great success.</span> <span id="s879">You can not do that anywhere in the world.</span> <span id="s880">You can’t do it India, China, or Russia, which are the same size.</span> <span id="s881">You can do it in Australia, but for most of it there’s no people, so [indecipherable] talk with some kangaroo.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Sheep, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Sheep.</span> <span id="s884">So, it’s not a fair [indecipherable] to go from Perth to Kearns is probably same distance as it is from Boston, San Francisco, but there’re no people there to talk to.</span> <span id="s885">And English, obviously, will get you by.</span> <span id="s886">Their version of it anyhow.</span> <span id="s887">So, those cultural things, and other kinds of counseling things, and other -- understanding of certain kind of -- psychological kind of issues that might be difficult, was what I did for the Peace Corps, and actually not just for the Peace Corps, but at the time, the administ -- president’s administration thought that they ought to put the Peace Corps together with the domestic Peace Corps called Vista.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: In an agency called Action, which never worked that well, but it did, so I was involved in both.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Let me stop here while --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: -- while -- so we don’t run -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Emanuel Mandel.</span> <span id="s894">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s895">Did I just lose my microphone?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: You lost your microphone.</span> <span id="s897">So, all I’m saying is that I was involved in both the domestic element of action, which was Vista, and the overseas element of action called Peace Corps.</span> <span id="s898">But I never served overseas, I never served [indecipherable] I was with them for eight years.</span> <span id="s899">After that I began to develop a private psychotherapy program, and practice, and I have done that in a couple of different locations for the last, gee, 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: What kind of issues do you deal with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Deal with adolescents and adults in issues that are -- many of them are similar no matter what age you are in.</span> <span id="s902">Depression is depression at any age, almost.</span> <span id="s903">The separation issues for younger people are the same no matter where you are, many of them having to do with the need to strike some kind of understanding and insight that an outsider can strike, that the insider cannot.</span> <span id="s904">Example, family comes to see me with a kid who is a high school senior, and this is March of any year.</span> <span id="s905">And the kid essentially has, in fact, run away, or left, come back after three or four days, because he feels that he no longer can function with the confines and the restrictions of the parental home.</span> <span id="s906">It’s devastating for a family to have this happen.</span> <span id="s907">If you can help the parents make some adjustment, the kid make some adjustment, gain some insight, and postpone that runaway for four months.</span> <span id="s908">Four months.</span> <span id="s909">Now, the kid is going to go away to school.</span> <span id="s910">That’s a legitimate runaway.</span> <span id="s911">It’s a runaway in either case, if you nee -- know what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s912">But in the one is legitimate and not devastating to the family, and one is.</span> <span id="s913">And sometimes the outsider can make that happen and observe that and understand it, cause I’m not emotionally involved with the kid nor the parents.</span> <span id="s914">And the parents, what they’ll do is they’ll do every kind of tough love issue there is, and they’ll restrict, and restrict, and the kid will rebel, and rebel.</span> <span id="s915">And the more you push, the more th -- you resist.</span> <span id="s916">Well, if you can understand that, and the dynamics of that, you can be very helpful.</span> <span id="s917">And once in awhile I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: It’s been a very interesting kind of gradual move for you in that direction, to working with people individually in their very intimate, kind of family problems.</span> <span id="s919">It’s not -- i-it’s not -- i-it was an evolution for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: I don’t think I could have said to you 35 years ago I’m gonna do that, because the number of folks in my field who were doing that, you could count on one hand, and I’m exaggerating again.</span> <span id="s923">It was the province of the psychiatrist, who had limited medication to prescribe, because there weren’t any.</span> <span id="s924">I mean, anybody could prescribe medication, many psychiatrists could, and the medication of choice 50 years ago was various kinds of tranquilizers.</span> <span id="s925">If you tranquilize them enough, all mental patients will be docile, and they could be put in institutions, and even into back wards, which no longer exist.</span> <span id="s926">The world has become much more complex than it was as recently as 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s927">A hundred years ago I can’t talk about.</span> <span id="s928">But in the last 50 years compli -- complexities have evolved geometrically.</span> <span id="s929">As a consequence, the kind of help that’s psychotherapeutically appropriate had to evolve into more practitioners.</span> <span id="s930">Psychologists began to do some of that, those who became clinical psychologists, not research guys.</span> <span id="s931">And today social workers provide more of that than any other profession by the number of hours provided in this community.</span> <span id="s932">Now, I didn’t think of doing that because I on -- first of all, that was not part of my thinking, secondly, I didn’t think that I could -- this may have some to do with what I did as a kid, I didn’t think that I could take the risk of economically subjecting my family to a -- to a horserace while my kids were still in school.</span> <span id="s933">I didn’t start this until after they were out of school.</span> <span id="s934">I figured the worst can happen, we’ll skip a meal.</span> <span id="s935">My wife and I will make it.</span> <span id="s936">And thirdly, I really thought that one cannot do this, no matter what training they have, until they have practiced in a variety of ways.</span> <span id="s937">I’ve always had individual attention to things.</span> <span id="s938">I mean, I remember when licensure became mandatory in the state of Maryland in 1970 - something or other.</span> <span id="s939">And obviously I was well off that I was -- I was out of school 15 years.</span> <span id="s940">And I had to put together the pieces of hours that I provided an individual psychotherapy, or individual counseling in the previous 15 years, an hour here, two hours there, three hours there, because I wasn’t doing this 40 hours a week.</span> <span id="s941">You had to come up with some 2,000 hours or something, and I don’t recall exactly how, but I think, you know, a percentage of every year was spent in this, in families.</span> <span id="s942">I mean, I had to, in my job in Michigan, I had to get a kid out of jail once in awhile, and I had to have a suicide attempt, and I had to have a runaway, and I had to have a something else.</span> <span id="s943">I mean, again, these things add up, but I did this on a very limited basis, and then of course it became something I did full time.</span> <span id="s944">But I didn’t think I could it full time, until I had amassed the body of experience.</span> <span id="s945">So you talked before about gapping bridges, or bridging gaps, I had to have bridges to things.</span> <span id="s946">And you don’t have a bridge to various things until you’ve had some experience, not so much in life, but life and applied practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: I’m leaping ahead to the big kind of question, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: You’re gonna bridge the gap, or gap the bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: I’m always trying to do that.</span> <span id="s950">What is it about your experience, your -- a fact of your being a survivor?</span> <span id="s951">What does that -- what -- what -- from that experience, what do you bring to what you do with people in -- in this setting?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: You’d be so -- you’d be so easy, and I -- and I have to tell you, I’ve thought about this a great deal, specifically because of this interview.</span> <span id="s953">It’d be so easy to say, well obviously I saw atrocities, I saw terrible things, I saw things that shouldn’t happen to humans, and the job that I now have helps humans, therefore -- that’s too glib, and too easy, and it’s not true.</span> <span id="s954">Now, does that impact?</span> <span id="s955">Of course.</span> <span id="s956">But I think the impact is an on -- is on -- on the -- on the understanding of behavior, of motivation, of choices, of why do people sometimes go like sheep, and sometimes don’t go like sheep, and it’s the same people in different settings?</span> <span id="s957">I can’t tell you the answer to that, but those kinds of behaviors does in some way have some additional armament, or some additional bridge to human behavior.</span> <span id="s958">But as I say, I cannot say, nor will I say to you that because, therefore -- it’s an obvious.</span> <span id="s959">I saw bad, I can do good, that’s a good thing.</span> <span id="s960">That’s glib.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: But you were in a position as a child to perhaps focus on cause and effect of people’s behaviors because there was -- you were in some danger --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: -- and you knew that, so you were -- you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Well, I don’t know how I knew it, I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Well, you -- you said before, in the other interview, that maybe you didn’t understand the larger situation, but you know when there’s a man there with a gun, and there’s barbed wire --</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: -- and there’s a turret, that this is not a normal --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: -- that I’m under some kind of danger here.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Okay, no, I was -- I was probably in more danger specifically in Israel when the independence war was going on, and shots were fired and some hit my house.</span> <span id="s971">It didn’t hit me, because I wasn’t stupid enough to be standing out there, but I’m saying that that kind of danger is a little different, but you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: I think that I have a capacity to observe, sharpened by 40 years of practice, by education, or by the eyesight that I was born with.</span> <span id="s974">I think I have an ability to in some way amalgamate various kinds of background pieces, and put it together into an approach, so that they become part of that.</span> <span id="s975">But I have to say again that maybe it’s because I was not old enough to understand, and maybe I would have understood at 15, the fact that I’m undamaged by it, at least substantially so, I recall, I understand, I can re-retell, I und -- I know what went on, and of course I understood the meaning of it subsequently, but I was not damaged the same way.</span> <span id="s976">A siren doesn’t frighten me, okay?</span> <span id="s977">And a siren is an example that’s given by many survivors, they hear a siren today, ambulance, and they freeze on some level, to some degree.</span> <span id="s978">A siren does not frighten me.</span> <span id="s979">And again, a siren here is only a smallest of examples, because the sirens were very dangerous, because we were bombed in Budapest.</span> <span id="s980">We spent days in the bunker, in -- not the bunker, in the cellar, and in the -- in the -- in the shelter.</span> <span id="s981">No, not days, we spent parts of days, sometimes four and five times a night.</span> <span id="s982">My grandmother, my father’s mother who was living with us at the time, went back to her little village, from which she was deported, because the elevator -- and I said this on the other tape -- the elevator was invariably out of commission, cause they couldn’t get parts to repair them, and to go down five stories, three and four times a night, was too much for her to do.</span> <span id="s983">Choice two was send her back where she didn’t have to go to the air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s984">And she was deported.</span> <span id="s985">Ah, she would have been deported perhaps, elsewhere as well.</span> <span id="s986">But I’m saying it’s because I under -- because I recalled, and can now, and have for some time been able to assimilate that.</span> <span id="s987">But I wasn’t -- you know, if you looked at my guts, they don’t have black and blue marks, they’re clear.</span> <span id="s988">Or my brain doesn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s990">What about your parents?</span> <span id="s991">Your father lived to -- into his 90’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: He was -- he would have been 90 in mar -- he would have been 90 in March, he died in January of the same year, it’s close enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Oh, uh-huh, yeah.</span> <span id="s994">So you -- you knew them for quite a -- your mother died quite young, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: My mother died at the age of 59 --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: -- for entirely different reasons, and I don’t think the Holocaust connected.</span> <span id="s998">One day they thought she had a stroke, cause she was dragging a leg.</span> <span id="s999">Literally days after the war in Israel in 1967, they went to Israel to visit family, after the six day war.</span> <span id="s1000">And they came back in August, I know I picked them up, I was in the east, I was living in Michigan, and my mother was not well.</span> <span id="s1001">Well, this is in August, by December they discovered she had a massive growth in her head, and that killed her.</span> <span id="s1002">I mean, they radiate it, but in those days this was a caveman oncology.</span> <span id="s1003">I mean, this was the kind of thing that today two pills, and something would cure it.</span> <span id="s1004">And I don’t mean that literally, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: -- it’s -- we have gone thousands of miles beyond that.</span> <span id="s1007">She -- this killed her.</span> <span id="s1008">There was a choice of operating or radiating.</span> <span id="s1009">And we were told that operating would invariably -- invariably produce a vegetable.</span> <span id="s1010">My father and I agreed that that’s of no value if she lives to be a hundred, in a bed as a vegetable.</span> <span id="s1011">We radiated, it metastasized, she died, 1967.</span> <span id="s1012">So the impact of my parents was significant, and in my father’s case lengthy, but very different in my mother’s.</span> <span id="s1013">You remember that I was with my mother all of my life.</span> <span id="s1014">I mean, I left both of them 1958 - ’59.</span> <span id="s1015">As a matter of fact, interestingly, we even lived with my parents for a very short time.</span> <span id="s1016">When I was looking for graduate school, one was in Pennsylvania, one was in New Jersey, one was in New York.</span> <span id="s1017">And I couldn’t find a rental for my wife and I for three months, or maybe four months, for a very short time, I -- in those days, Philadelphia did not offer very short rentals, and I guess a hotel was not an idea.</span> <span id="s1018">So we moved to my parent’s house until the decision was made where I would goi -- go to school.</span> <span id="s1019">And when it was made that I’m going to be in Philly, we took an apartment immediately, which was our first apartment, which was very nice.</span> <span id="s1020">But we lived with them.</span> <span id="s1021">But it was with my mother throughout.</span> <span id="s1022">When I was born, in Riga, two months after I was, my father went to Budapest to begin his rehearsals for the holidays in the fall.</span> <span id="s1023">My mother then packed up, and two uncles came out and helped her, and we trucked to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1024">My father was away from the house for continuous times in labor camps.</span> <span id="s1025">We were at home.</span> <span id="s1026">We went to Bergen-Belsen, he was not with us.</span> <span id="s1027">He comes after us to Palestine -- to Israel, he leaves before us.</span> <span id="s1028">So my father’s relationship with me as a child up to the age of 15 or so, is very spotty, and I am sure it had impact.</span> <span id="s1029">I can’t tell you precisely, but he wasn’t there, through no -- and I never held him accountable for not being there.</span> <span id="s1030">The fact that he was in his own field, meant that he never played baseball with me, but you can overcome that.</span> <span id="s1031">But he was not there, through no fault of his own.</span> <span id="s1032">His influence was there, his impact was there, his feelings were there.</span> <span id="s1033">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1034">I’m going to back up for a teeny story about language.</span> <span id="s1035">You asked about English.</span> <span id="s1036">My mother and my father correspond when he is here, and my mother and I are still in Haifa, and there were some times during the War of Independence in Israel where food was scarce.</span> <span id="s1037">Plentiful, but some things were scarce.</span> <span id="s1038">We had all the dairy and all the veg -- butter was rationed, you know?</span> <span id="s1039">You could live without that.</span> <span id="s1040">But all the bread, and all the vegetables, and some meat, and all the fish from Australia was available.</span> <span id="s1041">But my mother says that things are scarce.</span> <span id="s1042">My father gets absolutely frightened, and goes to the post office, and I remember to this day, he packs up a package from the grocery store, and ships it by air to Israel, 44 dollars.</span> <span id="s1043">It was probably a week’s salary in those days, 1947.</span> <span id="s1044">Ships this thing to Israel.</span> <span id="s1045">And we open up, and we see these little cans, little flat cans, and it says on it, Chicken of the Sea.</span> <span id="s1046">Well me, with my incredible knowledge of English, decided this is chicken.</span> <span id="s1047">It’s a very funny, oily chicken that these Americans put in cans.</span> <span id="s1048">Cans were not unusual to us, but what kind of chicken is this, and how do you cook it?</span> <span id="s1049">I cannot tell you what my mother did with this, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1050">But this was my knowledge of English, Chicken of the Sea was chicken, right?</span> <span id="s1051">Well, we both know that’s not exactly what it means.</span> <span id="s1052">My mother’s English was even less than mine.</span> <span id="s1053">She didn’t even know the word chicken.</span> <span id="s1054">But we had this neat meal.</span> <span id="s1055">As you know, kosher requires no mixing of the two.</span> <span id="s1056">We had this very strange American chicken.</span> <span id="s1057">It didn’t taste like chicken, it was in oil.</span> <span id="s1058">But it said chicken, and Mandel the English expert said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Mom --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Mom, it’s chicken.</span> <span id="s1061">Cause he knows.</span> <span id="s1062">And they also had corn flakes that were introduced, and we didn’t know how the hell do you butter corn flakes, like bread or that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1063">But again, I -- I couldn’t read the English, I mean I could underst -- I didn’t -- I might have known the word corn.</span> <span id="s1064">I am certain I didn’t know the word flakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: And I knew the word chicken, I knew the word sea, but I never could connect -- course I’m not sure I ever had tuna fish in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: I mean, why would I?</span> <span id="s1071">And if I did, it was a filet of tuna, or a stew of tuna, or something that my mother could recognize as a fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: The thing in the can doesn’t look like a fish.</span> <span id="s1074">English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: But I was with my mother -- I sometimes illustrate it by saying that I always spoke with my father in the language of the land in which we lived.</span> <span id="s1077">Hungarian in Hungary, Hebrew in Israel, English here.</span> <span id="s1078">With my mother, Hungarian always.</span> <span id="s1079">Not because she didn’t know any English, but with my mother it was always Hungarian, no matter where we lived.</span> <span id="s1080">There’s a different continuity with her than was with him.</span> <span id="s1081">So I missed his involvement, which was spotty, and clearly through no effort on his part to do that.</span> <span id="s1082">I suppose in some ways he could have been more of a dad only, but only in terms of throwing a ball right handed.</span> <span id="s1083">That’s silliness.</span> <span id="s1084">Every other way he was.</span> <span id="s1085">And I had the most consistent part of his life with me when I no longer needed it.</span> <span id="s1086">When I wanted it, but didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s1087">I mean, I was an adult, with two children, living in Michigan.</span> <span id="s1088">That’s -- it was in those days that I had full availability of my father, and none of my mother.</span> <span id="s1089">So that my parent’s influence on me had these kinds of impacts, both good and both -- I have both bad.</span> <span id="s1090">They both survived, but I did not spend equal time and equal impact for both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1092">Did you and your mother talk about the day -- about the war, and your experience together in Bergen-Belsen very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Not much, because we lived it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: You didn’t need to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: No.</span> <span id="s1096">In my family, conversations about this took place willy-nilly and at the drop of a hat.</span> <span id="s1097">But nobody had to be told.</span> <span id="s1098">I mean, my father had to be told about where we were, and we had to be told about where he was.</span> <span id="s1099">And that we did.</span> <span id="s1100">But it wasn’t a question of my mother and I talking about where we were, because we were there every day.</span> <span id="s1101">I saw her every day, there was not a day I didn’t see her.</span> <span id="s1102">You recall that when we went out of se -- out of Germany by German troop train, in Switzerland, who is the teacher that is accompanying this group of 20 kids?</span> <span id="s1103">My mother.</span> <span id="s1104">Which was good and bad, but again even then, I was not separated from her.</span> <span id="s1105">I digress, but for historical reasons it’s significant.</span> <span id="s1106">In some communication about the Custner group, I got a letter from a professor at Michigan State University in Lansing, Michigan.</span> <span id="s1107">I won’t mention a name because I’m not sure he wants to be named.</span> <span id="s1108">And the name rings a bell, and I write him a note, and I said, “Are you, by any chance, that kid,” -- and I send him a picture that I have, “with whom I was in Switzerland?”</span> <span id="s1109">And he says yes.</span> <span id="s1110">Okay?</span> <span id="s1111">And then he sends me -- we have been in touch -- he sends me a Xerox of a postcard, written to his mother by my mother, saying that the boy is having some difficulties.</span> <span id="s1112">He’s fine, but he’s not with his mother -- I was -- and he starts having some difficulties, but he’ll be alright, and she ask when is she going to come visit, whatever.</span> <span id="s1113">My mother’s handwriting, 1945.</span> <span id="s1114">And I have that.</span> <span id="s1115">And he sends it to me.</span> <span id="s1116">So I’m saying that my mother’s influence again was -- I had a couple of beatings really, really beatings, because a couple of kids walked off campus, and they were caught, and they were certain that I ratted, cause I’m the teacher’s kid.</span> <span id="s1117">And I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1118">I’m -- I really -- I wouldn’t dare.</span> <span id="s1119">I mean, of -- I -- it’s -- it’s against the rules.</span> <span id="s1120">In any case I’m saying my mother and I had this kind of a connection.</span> <span id="s1121">I probably look like my mother, much more than my father then, and throughout my life, although now people say to me, look at my eyes.</span> <span id="s1122">My father had a very different kind of a face, but I look like my mother, my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s1123">I was much closer to my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s1124">I spent time with my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s1125">My mother’s sisters, my mother’s brothers.</span> <span id="s1126">I only spent time with my father’s one brother, who went to Israel and died since.</span> <span id="s1127">And here, with my aunt in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1128">But I was much more connected, so with her, these discussions were unnecessary.</span> <span id="s1129">I have a friend of mine here who -- again I won’t name, who talks about he doesn’t have to learn about the civil rights struggle, of which he was both a victim and a winner, he just has to remember it.</span> <span id="s1130">Cause he was a law student in the basement, and a dumbwaiter would bring down the lessons at the University of Arkansas, many years ago, and I won’t give the names.</span> <span id="s1131">But he doesn’t have to -- to study it, he just has to remember it.</span> <span id="s1132">Well, in a same sense, I don’t have to study elements of the Holocaust that I lived through, I just have to remember it.</span> <span id="s1133">My mother and I could remember.</span> <span id="s1134">When she went to [indecipherable] and she bought a -- there’s a watch that I wear that she bought in [indecipherable] because in those days there was some thought that if you have a watch or two -- you could always trade a watch for a meal, a good Swiss watch.</span> <span id="s1135">And then she gave it to me later on, and it’s my watch for 50 years, lo -- more, more.</span> <span id="s1136">But we can remember those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: What about when you ha -- when your kids got old enough?</span> <span id="s1138">You -- there -- so often you hear these difficult stories about survivors telling their children, or not telling their children what they went through.</span> <span id="s1139">Since your experience was not such a traumatic one, you didn’t have that inhibition, I would think.</span> <span id="s1140">So many survivors say I don’t want to -- I don’t want to tell my kids because it was so horrible, and -- and they don’t need to know that.</span> <span id="s1141">But what was your experience with your kids?</span> <span id="s1142">How did you tell your kids, when did it come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: The difference in my trauma and others was the fact that mine was a much shorter duration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: And I did not understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: I wouldn’t want to -- I wouldn’t want to weight levels of trauma.</span> <span id="s1148">However, from day one, whatever that is, I was willing to, I thought that it’s important to know, you can’t know where you’re going if you don’t know where you came from.</span> <span id="s1149">Maybe a cliché.</span> <span id="s1150">George Santayana’s comment about the fact that if you don’t learn history well, you learn to -- you have to repeat it or relive it is another one, there are many of those.</span> <span id="s1151">And I have involved my kids in either visiting with me, speaking with me, going to the museum with me, coming to programs with me, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, any which way I can, and I think they are quite conversant.</span> <span id="s1152">I did not believe that since it’s traumatic for me, I should not give them the opportunity to learn.</span> <span id="s1153">That’s unfair.</span> <span id="s1154">It’s denying them experience that they should -- they can reject it, they can ignore it, but they have the right to possess it.</span> <span id="s1155">It is exactly what I said in the beginning of this conversation about archiving this material.</span> <span id="s1156">I think that many of the people that are recorded -- I mean, that have been, thousands and thousands, may not be interesting, and may be repetitions of some other folks, but if it isn’t archived, it can never be retrieved.</span> <span id="s1157">And I wanted to archive it in my kids, and my grandkids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Mm-hm, and how did they receive it?</span> <span id="s1159">It -- is it -- is it som -- do they ask you questions, do they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: In many ways, well sure.</span> <span id="s1161">But it’s become -- it is not a -- you know, a holy writ of some sort that needs to be approached gingerly and tenderly, like, I sh -- don’t want to upset you too much.</span> <span id="s1162">It was this year or la -- it was last year I think, there was a book written about the experience of Custner, not the Robert Saint John book, but by Alex Brand.</span> <span id="s1163">Alex Brand was the partner or colleague of Custner, who in fact was sent under German supervision to go talk to the allies about the original transfer of people versus trucks.</span> <span id="s1164">It’s not on this tape, but it’s in the history.</span> <span id="s1165">He was arrested in Syria, in Aleppo, and jailed in Cairo for the rest of the war.</span> <span id="s1166">He writes a book after the war called, “Desperate Journey.”</span> <span id="s1167">Some years -- many years ago, a friend of mine who has since gone, asked if I had the book.</span> <span id="s1168">I said, “No, but I’d like to reread it.”</span> <span id="s1169">And I borrowed it from him, and I gave it back to him.</span> <span id="s1170">Later on I ask him for the book again, he said, “I can’t find it.”</span> <span id="s1171">So I did something which is illegal, but not immoral, and not fattening.</span> <span id="s1172">I had occasion when I was with the Peace Corps to have the book borrowed from the Library of Congress on interagency loan, and I Xeroxed it.</span> <span id="s1173">That’s illegal, but not immoral, and not fattening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: As long as you didn’t sell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: I -- well it’s -- Xeroxing it is illegal, but it’s out of print.</span> <span id="s1176">And I gave a copy to my -- each of my kids, and I have one in the house.</span> <span id="s1177">Couple of years ago -- last year I remember, my daughter gets me a present for my birthday.</span> <span id="s1178">She got it on the internet, she found two copies of the book, bought them both, one for her, one for me.</span> <span id="s1179">I now have the book on the shelf, right next to Robert Saint Johns slightly fictionalized version.</span> <span id="s1180">My point being that she thinks about these things.</span> <span id="s1181">She had this idea, maybe on the internet with whatever, Amazon, oh I don’t know where, she was able to find the book, and there were three, I think, that were available, she didn’t need three, she got two.</span> <span id="s1182">My son calls me up the other day and talks about La Spaitsia, cause he saw some pictures with surfing.</span> <span id="s1183">Now these are all Holocaust connected, history connected to our family, that we were quite free to share, and to -- and to talk about, and to inform, and to update constantly.</span> <span id="s1184">When i did the Spielberg interview, my kids were here.</span> <span id="s1185">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Here we go.</span> <span id="s1187">Okay, we’re recording again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: All I was saying is that these are normal activities of daily life that happen without any specific reason, it just happens, and we do it, and my kids are very much involved with it.</span> <span id="s1189">My grandchildren, well, my son’s daughter is five, let’s wait.</span> <span id="s1190">My daughter’s daughter is 10, and she knows a little bit, and the son is 14, and he knows a lot.</span> <span id="s1191">And again, there are these conversations.</span> <span id="s1192">One of the things I did for my grandson, the 14 year old, as part of my -- interestingly for a Bar Mitzvah gift, or right of passage, I took him to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1193">I thought at 13, or 14, he was old enough to do that.</span> <span id="s1194">And he -- I’m not going to say that he enjoyed it, but you know, he at least was exposed to it.</span> <span id="s1195">Clearly, my taking him is an indication of my willingness, and his willingness to have the two of us have that experience together.</span> <span id="s1196">I was saying before on the tape that when the Spielberg interview took place in the house, they asked the family be there at the end and they photographed the whole family, and my kids all came.</span> <span id="s1197">And it’s quite an open door issue in this family.</span> <span id="s1198">It is not in many others, for many reasons.</span> <span id="s1199">I don’t happen to believe that protecting my kids of the reality of my past is a good thing to do, so I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: 20 years ago or so, when the Holocaust sort of became such a public issue in the United States, it was in the 70’s, I think when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Early 80’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: And after this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: The first world gathering of the Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1205">And there was this documentary on ABC about the Holocaust, a miniseries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: With Meryl Streep?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Was that it?</span> <span id="s1208">I can’t remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: That’s one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: -- who was in it, but it sounds to me though, like it wasn’t a time when the Holocaust sort of came out of the closet, in a sense, for you, because it -- it was never a -- an issue that wasn’t discussed.</span> <span id="s1211">But y -- among your friends and colleagues, did people that you knew suddenly say oh, tell me your story, or how did that awakening, if you will, affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: As I think back, it didn’t.</span> <span id="s1213">Then.</span> <span id="s1214">My awakening, if you will, came a little bit later, in that I said to myself, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1215">We’re running out of people, we’re running out of time.</span> <span id="s1216">I better be more active than I’ve been.</span> <span id="s1217">Oh, I had been involved and I was glad to speak here, or speak there.</span> <span id="s1218">You know, I -- my background includes having been through elements of the Holocaust, and different stories my father had, and then being in Israel afterwards, and being there during the War of Independence, and having been -- you know, I’ve -- I’ve a number of pieces, and that has been used in talks, in -- in -- in gatherings, in tell me your story, I’ve never been to Riga, whatever.</span> <span id="s1219">But nothing that was either concentrated, or directed.</span> <span id="s1220">It was kind of ad hoc, and here, there, whatever.</span> <span id="s1221">I think that the focus came not out of the awakening of the -- both the documentary or the miniseries Holocaust, and then The Shoah, which was the Polish filmmakers movie of many, many, many hours.</span> <span id="s1222">Or li -- it came a little bit later to me, and I don’t know exactly why.</span> <span id="s1223">Not that I wasn’t -- it was not denial, it was just that I didn’t wake up.</span> <span id="s1224">I can honestly say to you that at that Spielberg Academy Awards thing, was the thing that kind of woke me up most specifically.</span> <span id="s1225">To say you gotta do more, you gotta do, you gotta involve, you gotta involve yourself.</span> <span id="s1226">Use whatever you can about connecting pieces, more than you have before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Emanuel Mandel.</span> <span id="s1229">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1230">It was -- you were saying it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: It was not an issue of denial, it was an issue of inactivity in being involved, and since we’re here I’m going to enter another little -- not a commercial, just for the -- for the -- for history, and for legacy.</span> <span id="s1232">Nobody in this world ever, ever calls me Emanuel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Just informationally.</span> <span id="s1235">If they do, that means only one thing.</span> <span id="s1236">They never met me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: I don’t mean you necessarily --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: -- but you’re on the tape, but Emanuel is the way the phone book is listed, so people can look under M for Manny, they look for E for Emanuel, for what that’s worth.</span> <span id="s1241">[phone ringing].</span> <span id="s1242">Stop -- doesn’t ring here until about the fourth ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: So they gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1246">I have a couple of other questions that are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: -- aren’t directly related in chronology.</span> <span id="s1249">Did -- did your experience during the war, or -- i -- in some ways I feel like I have to ask you about your parents at the same time.</span> <span id="s1250">Was your religious faith interrupted in any way by what you’d been through, and what you saw in World War Two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: In one sense I can say to you that -- I’ll give you kind of a chicken answer, chicken meaning that I am unable to give anything else.</span> <span id="s1252">Let me come back through a back door.</span> <span id="s1253">One of the questions that has not been answered by me or anybody else, Einstein included, is where the world ends, and what’s beyond it.</span> <span id="s1254">Well, since that cannot be answered, I don’t really bother myself -- I haven’t got the intellectual capacity anyhow to understand it, but even if I could -- do worry about it, I don’t know what’s beyond the end of the world.</span> <span id="s1255">I don’t mean the end of the world, but the end of the, you know, the universe, and what’s there.</span> <span id="s1256">I assume that that’s where God picks up, but I can’t understand it in my own intellect.</span> <span id="s1257">In the same sense, I cannot tell you why God permitted this to happen.</span> <span id="s1258">I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s1259">As a consequence, I look at my religious background, and my religion as a historical connection.</span> <span id="s1260">As a valid contribution to civilization, and in that sense it’s not interrupted by what happened, and I’m not one of those who has said, I will now deny and blame God because he permitted this to happen.</span> <span id="s1261">I don’t know if that’s true.</span> <span id="s1262">In the grand scheme of things, I don’t understand the end of the universe, nor why this happened.</span> <span id="s1263">There are other things I don’t understand, but this is the one that you asked me about, so I’ll stay with that, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Did you have conversations with your parents about this, or do you have any way of knowing how they felt about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: I can’t -- I’ve not committed to memory any conversations with them.</span> <span id="s1266">I’m sure we did, I mean, you know, you are in a house, you are -- the three of us, we talk at dinner, we talk here and there.</span> <span id="s1267">I’m sure we did.</span> <span id="s1268">And I can’t tell you that I have a clear statement from them.</span> <span id="s1269">Interestingly, from my mother’s sisters, the two -- two sisters who both lost their husbands during the war, remarried, and lived out their lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s1270">The two sisters -- the daughter of one of the sisters, and their parents, my grandparents, were taken to Auschwitz at the same time, and the same place.</span> <span id="s1271">The sisters were told to go to the left at Mengele’s hut.</span> <span id="s1272">The daughter and the grandparents were told to go to the right, or vice-a-versa.</span> <span id="s1273">And you know what happened, the sisters survived.</span> <span id="s1274">The sisters, particularly the youngest sister, who was the most recent, was the last one to die, had some strong feelings about God, and why did you do this.</span> <span id="s1275">Didn’t blame, didn’t held up anything, lived her life, but had.</span> <span id="s1276">She was the only one in the family, but she was always the -- the doubting Thomas in the family.</span> <span id="s1277">She was the least impacted by religious upbringing, even though she grew up in the same household as my mother did.</span> <span id="s1278">So what I’m saying to you is that the family yes, in my parent’s home, I cannot give you an example of the discussion being had about their feelings about God.</span> <span id="s1279">I think that they -- no, I’ll g -- go the other way.</span> <span id="s1280">I would suspect that some of what I said to you about my own thinking is consistent with their thinking, because it’s connected to their thinking, and grows out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: I want to -- if you don’t mind, I’m going to look at my notes, because -- have you been back to Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Only once.</span> <span id="s1283">Again, I’m going to go through the back door just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1284">As the war ends we’re in Switzerland, and after some stay at a children’s home in Hayden, which is in [indecipherable] province, the German province in Switzerland, we begin our journey south through Italy, to go to Palestine, actually.</span> <span id="s1285">My mother did not want to go back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1286">We are sitting in Taranto, which is a port city in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: I don’t know why it did that -- want to go back to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1289">We are in fact now having by -- gone by train and by truck through Italy to Taranto, which is in the arch of the boot, to board a ship, actually became a British military ship, to transport -- to take us to Haifa.</span> <span id="s1290">My mother receives a telegram from my father -- not the first time, I mean they had had contact, that says essentially, you know, things are this and that, and come on back.</span> <span id="s1291">And she says, mm-mm, she does not go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1293">Afraid to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: No, upset to go back.</span> <span id="s1295">She said after what happened in Europe, she is not going to go back to live in Europe.</span> <span id="s1296">And after that they visited in Germany, they visited in Yugoslavia --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Careful with that, you can hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Sorry, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Yeah, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: In Yugoslavia and other places, she never went back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1301">My father did after my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s1302">Having said that, we never went back until many years later, as a matter of fact we went back in -- about 15 years ago now, I recall the partic -- 1988, I had wanted my wife to see Budapest, and 1988 was soon after the Russians, and the Soviets and all that, and Budapest was beginning to reawaken.</span> <span id="s1303">It was never under the heel.</span> <span id="s1304">Budapest is one of the cities that is na -- did not have a Russian palace of culture, which is that wedding cake monstrosity that’s in the middle of Riga, and Warsaw, and lots of other places.</span> <span id="s1305">So we did, we went back.</span> <span id="s1306">We went back to see, and the impact was interesting because all the streets got smaller.</span> <span id="s1307">Maybe because I got bigger.</span> <span id="s1308">And the other thing, which had nothing to do with me, there were cars parked on both sides of the street.</span> <span id="s1309">Well, this is again, 1988, not 1938.</span> <span id="s1310">There were cars in Budapest 1930 -- my father never owned a car, nobody owned cars.</span> <span id="s1311">That’s what taxis are for.</span> <span id="s1312">You know, that’s what chauffeurs are for.</span> <span id="s1313">And we used public transportation.</span> <span id="s1314">But went back, saw our apartment, saw much of the area that I was familiar with, which was quite small -- I was a little kid.</span> <span id="s1315">Ice skating rink, and the synagogue, and the location of my father’s synagogue, and some other places.</span> <span id="s1316">I have some non-family family there, in that my father’s second wife, my stepmother, who to this day lives strong and healthy at 93 in Philadelphia, has a niece -- two nieces, who are actually related only to her first husband.</span> <span id="s1317">But I know them, and they welcomed us to wash -- to washingt -- to Budapest, and spent some time, and -- and I’d like to go back, because I’d like to go back to eastern Hungary, where my father was raised, and I was never there in my life, and I would also like to visit the graves of my grandfather, and some others.</span> <span id="s1318">I’d like to do that, while it’s still possible to do it.</span> <span id="s1319">It is now possible, there was a time when you couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1320">My father could not get back there, because it was then in -- under Russian control, and U.S. and Russia, and you know, it was a catastrophe, you’d have to go through Moscow, and the [indecipherable] now, you don’t.</span> <span id="s1321">My father was born in Hungary, became a Czech citizen, it is now the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1322">It tells you something.</span> <span id="s1323">But I did go back to Budapest, thought it was very nice, it was very much like I remembered, much of it.</span> <span id="s1324">Am I familiar with it?</span> <span id="s1325">Yes, with 35 square blocks, not the city, which is first of all grown and changed.</span> <span id="s1326">But my Budapest was very warm and fuzzy to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Did you by any chance feel the need to go to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Need, no, desire yes.</span> <span id="s1329">And it just had not been the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1330">I would very much want to go -- first I want to see -- although there’s nothing in Bergen-Belsen except for memorial, and the land.</span> <span id="s1331">I’d like to have my wife see it.</span> <span id="s1332">As a matter of fact, I went for the first time in my life to Auschwitz, in 1994 with a program called the March of the Living, I don’t know if you’re familiar, if the -- the familiarity, but kids go on -- on Yom HaShoah, on the day of the commemoration of the Holocaust, 6,000 young people -- young, up to not so young, convene and march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, which is ver -- which is Auschwitz two, which is what you see where all the huts are.</span> <span id="s1333">Have you been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s1336">Auschwitz itself is an old prison, an army barrack, and it’s brick.</span> <span id="s1337">That’s where you see the sign, Arbeit mac -- macht frei, and two miles away, or thereabouts, maybe three, I don’t recall, it’s not a very long distance, is Birkenau, which is the enormous -- you see the pictures of -- first of all the train pulls in, in the Shoah documentary, and that’s where you have all these huts, and all these kind of barracks that became -- that’s where Mengele had his shop, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1338">And that’s the first time in my life, and maybe the last time I was there, except I’d like to have my wife see it.</span> <span id="s1339">But I had no other Auschwitz things.</span> <span id="s1340">I’d like to go to Bergen-Belsen because I’d like to visit where I was as a child.</span> <span id="s1341">I’ve seen documentaries, and tapes, and movies, and spoken to people who’ve gone back, which is perfectly okay, but I’d like to see it.</span> <span id="s1342">All wants, no need to go.</span> <span id="s1343">I don’t have to go and need to visit graves there, I have no graves there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1345">Of the 1600 that were there with you, are you in touch with any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Well, I’m in touch with the professor at Lansing, I’m in touch with the professor in Brooklyn, who was in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1347">I’m in touch with another man who was in Turish.</span> <span id="s1348">Now, the touch doesn’t mean daily touch, but has been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: -- we know each other, we know -- if I were to go to Turish, I would look him up.</span> <span id="s1351">If I went to New York, I would look him up, and I went to Michigan [indecipherable] and I would like to believe that if they came to town, and they had a spare two hours, they would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1352">Beyond that, the only other people that I knew who were with us was a couple and their daughter who live in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1353">He is gone, the wife is aged and not completely here, although she’s alive.</span> <span id="s1354">And the daughter is a little younger than I, we did not grow up together, she has no recollection.</span> <span id="s1355">And although we were at the same place at the same time for half a year, that’s the only thing that connects us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, and you’ve been back to Israel, because you still had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Oh many times, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: -- cousins there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Well, I went back with groups, I went back by myself.</span> <span id="s1360">I was in Israel two years ago, well, it’s gonna be three years now, just days before we left on a -- on a Thursday, and Intifada started the next day.</span> <span id="s1361">I went to a cousin’s kid’s wedding.</span> <span id="s1362">My son and I had a father and son tour.</span> <span id="s1363">Just the two of us went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: And a [indecipherable] Israel in -- in ’49, I went back in ’57, went back in ’65 - ’69 - ’73, then not until ’85 - ’88 - ’91 - ’94 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Oh my, you’ve been there a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: -- and 2000?</span> <span id="s1368">Well, anyhow, a dozen times or thereabouts.</span> <span id="s1369">I’m quite comfortable there, quite familiar, always something new to see, we always do something that we haven’t done before, although the bulk of the visits have been for the purpose of s-seeing family, which now is more difficult.</span> <span id="s1370">The aunts are gone, an uncle is gone, their spouses are gone.</span> <span id="s1371">But they died because everybody does.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: In their 80’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: What do you want to say that I haven’t asked you about?</span> <span id="s1375">Anything -- I mean, it’s a big subject, and you’ve been interviewed a number of times, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Well, I could also say what would you like to ask that you haven’t asked.</span> <span id="s1377">No.</span> <span id="s1378">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1379">I made some notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: You asked about it, but I don’t think I responded.</span> <span id="s1382">Effects of the Holocaust on me.</span> <span id="s1383">Clearly, although I can’t prove it, I would not have been an only child if not for the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1384">My parents -- well, actually I’m not an only child, my parents had a child before I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Right, a brother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Who was born perfectly healthy and 10 weeks he died of starvation, and I think I said very clearly, that had nothing to do with the availability of food or medical help, he couldn’t absorb.</span> <span id="s1387">I’d like to see his grave.</span> <span id="s1388">My brother, as it were.</span> <span id="s1389">But I would have had -- remember, in 1936 when I was born, my mother was 28, my father was 32, clearly in child-bearing years.</span> <span id="s1390">So that I think I would have had siblings, or sibling, but my father wasn’t home, which made it difficult, and the times were not conducive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: So one of the results of the Holocaust, I think, and ma -- my wife is not Holocaust connected, she has one sister.</span> <span id="s1393">Why didn’t they have seven child -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1394">But I would have had a sibling.</span> <span id="s1395">The other thing I would say to you is that I think -- now, again I can’t tell you this is Holocaust connected, or it’s because I am what I am and I was made how I was made.</span> <span id="s1396">But I have thought about, and folks -- some folk -- some folks have said -- sorry, you can hear that, thank you -- some folks have said that I missed elements of childhood.</span> <span id="s1397">I was never a kid, or never a kid for too long in any one place.</span> <span id="s1398">It’s difficult, even with the resiliency of kids.</span> <span id="s1399">First grade was in Hungary, second grade was in Bergen-Belsen -- if you want to call it that.</span> <span id="s1400">Third grade was in s -- in Switzerland, fourth grade was in kibbutz -- different language.</span> <span id="s1401">Fifth grade, sixth grade, part of seventh was in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1402">Then English in New York, then Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1403">So you talk about I don’t know how many schools, and certainly three languages.</span> <span id="s1404">Makes it difficult to spend time being a kid.</span> <span id="s1405">Now, what would I have done as a kid?</span> <span id="s1406">I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1407">Because I certainly have recollections having birthday parties, and not having a bicycle, and then having a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1408">I don’t remember missing things as a kid.</span> <span id="s1409">Being with family, and some cousins.</span> <span id="s1410">But I still think that there was a requirement of me, maybe because the way I am, to have been an adult much earlier than I would have been, had it not been for the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1411">And I will leave that with an observation, leave it at that.</span> <span id="s1412">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s1414">Good.</span> <span id="s1415">Let me -- have to state the ending.</span> <span id="s1416">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Manny
