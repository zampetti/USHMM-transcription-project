<p><span id="s13">A: When the Germans occupied, they changed it to Littmanstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And I understand you said that you would give me the spelling of some of the terms - after the interview, and I will turn these in on a sheet.</span> <span id="s15">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s16">What were the names of your parents, your grandparents, or even great-grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My great-grandparents, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s18">My grandmother from my mother’s side was Rikla Solski.</span> <span id="s19">My grandfather was Shimon Solski, Simon Solski.</span> <span id="s20">My father’s name was Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Now, they were all residents of the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: No, my grandparents lived in Biala Podlaska.</span> <span id="s23">In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And what did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My father was in the wood business.</span> <span id="s26">We used to build wooden homes, and we used to have forests, and cut the trees, and this type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did you live within the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: We lived in a Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How large a city was Lodz at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Lodz was a very large city.</span> <span id="s31">In fact, it’s the second largest in Poland.</span> <span id="s32">It was Warsaw and Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: So you sold wood to people in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: We sold wooden houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: You built houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: We built houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Oh, so you actually were in construction.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: At that time, what they used to do, is they put ‘em together on our property, then disassembled, and then brought ‘em over.</span> <span id="s39">Prefabricated.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: You were very modern.</span> <span id="s41">Prefabricated houses.</span> <span id="s42">Did you deal with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yeah, a lot of ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: What was that experience like?</span> <span id="s45">Working with, communicating with, trading with gentiles at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, it’s very hard for me to say that, because I went in the concentration camp when I was 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s48">But your father did deal with non-Jewish merchants.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: My father dealt with Poles as well as with Volksdeutscher, half Polish and half German.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s51">Maybe you’d like to recall your father’s feelings about non-Jews that he was working with?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A; Well, I thought at that particular time it was, you know, it was anti-Semitism in Poland.</span> <span id="s53">I don’t have to tell you that.</span> <span id="s54">You know that.</span> <span id="s55">Besides pogroms, coming in and knocking out windows and all this type of thing, I remember an incident where they went down from a meeting which they used to call the Narodopses, which used to be on Hitler’s side, Poles and Volksdeutschen, and after the meeting, they used to go out and knife Jewish people - kill ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And you remember that this occurred when you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: This occurred in 1938 and 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Was this something that you actually witnessed?</span> <span id="s59">Or you heard about it from relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Something I witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Is this something that you’re gong to tell about later, or would you tell me about it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Well, it’s not much.</span> <span id="s63">Just was a tremendous anti-Semitism in Poland, that was growing as Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s64">It was growing more and more.</span> <span id="s65">Now I know my experience when I used to go to school, where I got beaten up and al this type of thing.</span> <span id="s66">I come from a pretty religious family - not fanatic, but religious.</span> <span id="s67">I used to wear payess.</span> <span id="s68">And there was not a day that I was not spit on or beaten up, and all this type of thing.</span> <span id="s69">Now this all occurred in 1937, ‘38 and ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So the anti-Semitism intensified at the point where the Germans were coming to power, and enacting their laws, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So the climate was felt all over Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And very directly by you - on a daily basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Right.</span> <span id="s76">In fact, just to make a point, there used to be a town they called Nova Solna, like a suburban area, not far from Lodz.</span> <span id="s77">And I remember that when the Germans attacked Poland, that the whole town of Nova Solna, which was Volksdeutcher, half Poles, half German - attacked the Polish Army, even cooperating with the German military.</span> <span id="s78">So the whole town uprose against the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s79">This was the people that lived in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Then what was the outcome of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: There was no outcome.</span> <span id="s82">They helped the German Army to occupy Lodz, even fighting the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s83">They blew up tanks, and at that time there were horses.</span> <span id="s84">If you’re a historian, you know how the Polish Army was equipped.</span> <span id="s85">Buggies and horses.</span> <span id="s86">There was no trucks like you have here today.</span> <span id="s87">By today’s standards, it was a very primitive army.</span> <span id="s88">The Germans were all on trucks and wheels, and the Poles were not prepared for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s90">What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: German, Polish, Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: (Laughs) I suppose one was always singled out as a Jew in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Your accent was different.</span> <span id="s95">You wore the skullcap to school every day?</span> <span id="s96">You attended a secular school or a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: I went to school for eight hours, since I was four years old, five years old.</span> <span id="s98">I used to go to heder for eight hours.</span> <span id="s99">And then when I got into what’s called “public school,” which you had to take, which was the Polish language and learn about Poland, I went four hours to public school and the other four hours to heder.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Now you mention that your family was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Would you describe the extent of that observance, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well the extent of religion was that we kept Shabbos, and my father was every morning praying.</span> <span id="s104">And every Saturday we used to have a group of people coming into our house where my father was teaching the Bible, as much as 15 to 20 people every Saturday.</span> <span id="s105">There wasn’t a Saturday that I remember there was not, since my childhood.</span> <span id="s106">All the kids had to play outside, and I had to sit, and listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So your father was informally functioning as a rabbi within his small community?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: My father was, if you want to call it, a Biblical scholar.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s110">People came to him for his expertise.</span> <span id="s111">So, that was quite an intellectual environment for you, then.</span> <span id="s112">And you mentioned that you were a captive audience.</span> <span id="s113">Did you begin to become interested in the teachings?</span> <span id="s114">Were you reading...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, I was interested to a certain point, as a child is, as a kid is.</span> <span id="s116">I was 13, 12, ten, nine.</span> <span id="s117">When I got into concentration camp, I changed my mind a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: All right, I would very much like to hear about that.</span> <span id="s119">But as a young boy, you felt very much a part of the traditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: This is all I knew.</span> <span id="s121">We had a very strict home with a lot of respect.</span> <span id="s122">I would never sit in my father’s chair.</span> <span id="s123">We never started eating until my father picked up a spoon, till everybody’s at the table.</span> <span id="s124">And I’m doing this today, with my kids.</span> <span id="s125">It’s the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: So you believe it’s important to preserve the ritual?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I think it’s important - absolutely.</span> <span id="s128">It’s not a matter of being afraid.</span> <span id="s129">It’s a matter of respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did you have a concept then, as you were growing up, of a Supreme Being?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Well, you know Fiddler on the Roof, what he says, “We’re chosen people?</span> <span id="s132">God, please choose somebody else!”</span> <span id="s133">(Laughter) I don’t feel this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: But then?</span> <span id="s135">As a child?</span> <span id="s136">When your father was davening and praying to God?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: As a child, I believed, I wa religious.</span> <span id="s138">There’s no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: You were not into questioning when you were a young adolescent, before the war hit, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No, I was not into questioning, and I think as we get in, I’ll tell you why I was not into questioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Now, at what point did you become aware of the change in the atmosphere?</span> <span id="s142">You mentioned that there was persecution on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s143">At what point did this begin, really: Was it there from the start?</span> <span id="s144">Did it just intensify at the point where Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: You’re talking about Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: The persecution was always in Poland.</span> <span id="s148">There was always anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s149">And the famous slogan in Poland was - as long as I can remember, and as people told me about it - you say in Polish, “Zejay ech de Palestini,” “Jew, get out of here and go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s150">This was a very famous slogan with all Poles: “Jude!</span> <span id="s151">Go to Palestine!”</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And that goes way back in history.</span> <span id="s153">But, at the time of the Nazis coming to power, all of this became more systematic, didn’t it?</span> <span id="s154">In Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: There was more.</span> <span id="s156">The propaganda in Poland, as far as anti-Semitism, was absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s157">I mean, starting up in young kids and all that.</span> <span id="s158">But you also have to remember, if I may get away and just make a point.</span> <span id="s159">You have to remember that Poland was really bad.</span> <span id="s160">For example, before Christmas.</span> <span id="s161">And you could see this.</span> <span id="s162">This was a pattern.</span> <span id="s163">And the reason was, that there used to be a propaganda that Jewish people, for Passover, are killing Polish kids and drinking their blood, or something like that!</span> <span id="s164">And so this, by itself, was enough to intensify the behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: The animosity that was already there.</span> <span id="s166">There was an excuse for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Right, absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Now, did your teachers confront you with this kind of propaganda?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No.</span> <span id="s170">No.</span> <span id="s171">Most of our teachers were Jewish teachers, even in the public schools.</span> <span id="s172">In Poland was a tremendous amount of intellectual people - at least in my time - going to high school, so to speak, up ‘til 13 years old.</span> <span id="s173">This is all that I went.</span> <span id="s174">I never finished it because of the war.</span> <span id="s175">My teachers, I remember, was mostly Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s176">They must have believed in women’s liberation then, because they mostly were women, my teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What about the old tradition that Jewish women stayed at home and let their husbands be the scholars?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well, but this was public schools.</span> <span id="s179">In Poland, the majority of people worked.</span> <span id="s180">There was a very small segment of people that were rich, so to speak, but Poland was all very hard working Jewish society.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And they were educating their daughters and letting their daughters make their own way in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Now, if you would, tell me please about the events that first made you aware that a war was taking place in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: This was the summer in 1939.</span> <span id="s185">And my parents sent me to a camp called the Schnova Gurot.</span> <span id="s186">This was not far from Lodz, also.</span> <span id="s187">And my first experience in this camp, was there were a lot of Jewish people with us, kids from Germany, where they have to leave.</span> <span id="s188">I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but in 1937 and ‘38, Hitler kicked out a lot of German Jews from Poland.</span> <span id="s189">They came to Poland, left everything in Germany.</span> <span id="s190">And this was the bunch of kids that I was with.</span> <span id="s191">One day we got up in the morning, and they say, “Germans invaded Poland.”</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: How was the news transmitted?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: The news was transmitted by radio.</span> <span id="s194">Germans invaded Poland, and they took us together on the playground and told us to find our way home.</span> <span id="s195">And there was chaos.</span> <span id="s196">I remember myself and a lot of kids, jut walking - I cannot tell you right now how many miles it was - but we walked back from the camp to home.</span> <span id="s197">The airplanes were soaring overhead, and bombardment was going on.</span> <span id="s198">This was the first time that I came in touch with what war is all about.</span> <span id="s199">And I saw the ambulances and dead people on the street, and houses were bombarded, and shrapnel’s flying all over.</span> <span id="s200">When I got home, there was blackouts.</span> <span id="s201">And I remember I was tickled to death, that as a kid I got a flashlight to have by myself.</span> <span id="s202">And a gas mask.</span> <span id="s203">They used to hand out gas masks and flashlights and all that.</span> <span id="s204">And so this was my first contact with the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What happened in Lodz at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, this is what it was.</span> <span id="s207">Lodz was bombarded, Lodz and the suburban area.</span> <span id="s208">The Germans attacked Poland.</span> <span id="s209">They occupied Poland - I think the whole war took about eight days - but they had been standing four weeks before Warsaw.</span> <span id="s210">They couldn’t get into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s211">They occupied whole Poland in about ten days.</span> <span id="s212">All the Polish soldiers, they assembled themselves in Warsaw, and the Germans could not get into Warsaw for four weeks.</span> <span id="s213">They resisted.</span> <span id="s214">They barricaded.</span> <span id="s215">And they’d been fighting street to street.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: But what about aerial bombardment?</span> <span id="s217">Weren’t they bombing Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: They bombarded until eventually the water got cut off.</span> <span id="s219">There was no water, no food and everything else.</span> <span id="s220">In fact, I went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s221">We left Lodz, my brothers and I, and went to Warsaw, because we felt that in Warsaw was going to be a little better, because we escape the Germans, as the Germans start coming in.</span> <span id="s222">Most of the Jewish people left their towns and tried to escape - go to Russia and other places.</span> <span id="s223">And we wound up in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And what was that like at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, this was Hell.</span> <span id="s226">The bombardment was hell, because it was day-in and day-out, night and day.</span> <span id="s227">The hunger was tremendous.</span> <span id="s228">People were eating horsemeat.</span> <span id="s229">There was no water, was nothing.</span> <span id="s230">And it was really bad then.</span> <span id="s231">Hundreds and thousands of people died.</span> <span id="s232">And eventually they came in and occupied Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What kind of dwelling did you have in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s234">Did you have relatives there?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: I had an uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So you all were able to crowd into his apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: What did you do for food?</span> <span id="s239">Was he able to provide food for the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No, in the first few days, we had it.</span> <span id="s241">Later on, it was real tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: So the city was surrounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: They took whole Poland.</span> <span id="s244">The war was over between the Germans and Poland.</span> <span id="s245">They occupied Poland.</span> <span id="s246">This is the end of that.</span> <span id="s247">Then we went back to Lodz, and got back together.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: How were you able to leave Warsaw?</span> <span id="s249">It was an occupied city at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Well, also, whole Poland was occupied.</span> <span id="s251">It was not a question of just a city.</span> <span id="s252">The Germans occupied Poland, and you could travel from one city to the other.</span> <span id="s253">Thousands of people were going from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s254">The Germans began to release Polish soldiers from the camps.</span> <span id="s255">And so there was chaos all over.</span> <span id="s256">But people traveled back and forth to get together with their families.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Now you were, at this point, labeled as Jews?</span> <span id="s258">Were you wearing the Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No.</span> <span id="s260">At that point nothing.</span> <span id="s261">At that point you had to watch, because they are looking for Jews all over, and they were cutting the beards and the payess.</span> <span id="s262">And what happened at that time, they just was more of an aggravation, but it was no Jewish star or anything like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: I think that became compulsory later in that year, didn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Later it became compulsory, right.</span> <span id="s265">But in the beginning, as the Germans came up, if Jewish people were walking with the beard and payess and all this type of thing, they were just standing and cutting the beards, cutting the, payess, laughing at you, beating you up a little bit, and this type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So there was daily humiliation but you were able to move about.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Was daily humiliation from Day One.</span> <span id="s268">That’s exactly right.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: But your father, of course, was not able to continue his work.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: My father, no, this was over with.</span> <span id="s271">After the German occupied Poland, this whole thing fell apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: But he was able to preserve his savings?</span> <span id="s273">So that he could buy food for the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Well, yeah, we bought food at that time.</span> <span id="s275">Was still available, and life got back to a little bit, so to speak, normal.</span> <span id="s276">And then, of course, the Germans start making a ghetto.</span> <span id="s277">Everything begins.</span> <span id="s278">They start making a ghetto, which they took a part of Lodz, and the put on barbed wires, and bridges.</span> <span id="s279">And all the Jews from all over Lodz had to assemble in one area, which was the ghetto area.</span> <span id="s280">You couldn’t get in, you couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s281">And they took Poles, cleaned out the Poles from there, where we were living, and got them to someplace else, and the Jewish people occupied a whole area which was called the Littmanstadt Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Now, what was that experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: That experience was bad.</span> <span id="s284">It was real bad, because you couldn’t take much stuff with you.</span> <span id="s285">The Germans came into the houses and say you have to leave in five minutes or ten minutes or in half an hour or whatever.</span> <span id="s286">All the belongings was left.</span> <span id="s287">And then you got into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s288">And in ghetto there was just not enough places, and people moved in together.</span> <span id="s289">Families moved in together.</span> <span id="s290">Lived together.</span> <span id="s291">And there was really a lot of chaos.</span> <span id="s292">People lived on the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How many of you were living in one apartment at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Well in our particular case, in our case was a little different, because my father was involved in the Jewish community - pretty heavily.</span> <span id="s295">And so we were on the Jewish cemetery in Lodz.</span> <span id="s296">On the Jewish cemetery there used to be a house, a beautiful brick house where the people used to live there year around, which are the people that buried the dead.</span> <span id="s297">So they lived right on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s298">And we got an apartment in this particular house, and my father ran the cemetery.</span> <span id="s299">There were so many deaths, that they had to be buried in mass graves, and this has to be organized in some fashion.</span> <span id="s300">I remember, it used to be winter, and they brought in frozen Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s301">They were in the Polish military, and they used to go out and try to find who was Jewish so they could be buried in the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s302">And so literally, there was in the hundreds and hundreds!</span> <span id="s303">I remember that, because I helped bury ‘em.</span> <span id="s304">And so my father was in there, and he’d been running the cemetery, to organize the burials and the cleanup of the streets and this whole business.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Not a traditional activity for a Jewish scholar.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: That must have been terribly painful for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: But he was chosen by the community to get this thing going, because, you know, people start smelling on the streets, which is bad.</span> <span id="s309">And due to the fact of the war, everything was disorganized.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: So people rose to the occasion, then, and did what had to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s312">Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s313">You know, this particular people: God will take care of all the problems.</span> <span id="s314">You know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: They believed that!</span> <span id="s316">(Laughs) Well, He was “resting” a few times, wasn’t He?</span> <span id="s317">Did you have family outside of Lodz and outside of Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: In Biala Podlaska, like I say, my grandparents.</span> <span id="s319">This is on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s320">From mine father’s side - the Bankhalters - I remember my grandfather lived in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s321">And he passed away before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Okay, and what happened to the grandparents who were living in Biala Podlaska?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: My grandmother came in and lived with us.</span> <span id="s324">As the war broke out, my brother went there, and picked her up, and brought her, and she lived with us.</span> <span id="s325">And then she died in ghetto - later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Were there other relatives whom you lost contact with?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s328">I got one aunt living in Paris, right now - the sister of my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Was she in the camps during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: No, she’d been hiding out as a Pole under false papers.</span> <span id="s331">In Belgium and other places.</span> <span id="s332">She has her own story.</span> <span id="s333">If she’d be here, you should interview her.</span> <span id="s334">She comes to visit me next year.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s336">So, if you’d like to continue with your story - at the time of the resettlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: And so I got back to Poland, in this whole chaos, and then on the 28th of February, the Germans closed off all the streets in this ghetto, and picked up people from the streets and sent them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s338">And they called it the Bloody Thursday - the Jewish, they called it the “Blitigah Donestik.”</span> <span id="s339">It was very famous in Lodz.</span> <span id="s340">This was on the 28th of February, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Would you tell me about that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Well, I went for an errand for mine father, and I got picked up from the street, put in a railroad box, and I wind up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s343">I run away from Auschwitz, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: How does one run away from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Oh, at that time, we just builded it.</span> <span id="s346">We built it - the defenses and all that.</span> <span id="s347">I was the first one coming in there.</span> <span id="s348">Which was in 1940.</span> <span id="s349">I hided in a railroad truck with straw shoes, which they made for the German Army - for the military.</span> <span id="s350">I don’t know where they came from.</span> <span id="s351">I hided and went back Lodz, been picked up again and send back to Cracow, from Cracow back to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: So this is before they were really organized, and there was little surveillance.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s354">Went to Cracow.</span> <span id="s355">Worked on roads.</span> <span id="s356">And then picked up and got back to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Had you not been tattooed when you first arrived in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yeah, they tattooed, but, like I say, at that time you’d be able to do something.</span> <span id="s359">It was not organized as they organized later.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: But was there punishment then for having fled?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Well, they didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s362">The documentation was not as much, and we all looked alike, you know.</span> <span id="s363">To recognize somebody was pretty tough at that particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s365">Well, tell me about the experience then of being returned to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s366">I suppose while you were out of the camp the first time, you had no contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No.</span> <span id="s368">Well, in Auschwitz, you know, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s369">I spent five years, from 1940 till the liberation - I think it was in May.</span> <span id="s370">I was liberated in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s371">And being in Auschwitz, they sent me to different camps that belonged to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s372">I’m certain names may not be recognized here, like Netzbachtahl, Krevinkl, Ohrdruff.</span> <span id="s373">I’ve got it all written out and I can give it to you at a later date.</span> <span id="s374">So it’s all different camps that we been sent for labor.</span> <span id="s375">And then when the project was over, we got back to Auschwitz again.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Now all during this time, there was no communication with family?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So as far as you understood, they were still in that ghetto area, in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Let me go back a little to ask you about that experience in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s381">What do you remember about that?</span> <span id="s382">Do you remember anything about Jewish organizations that were forming in those early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No.</span> <span id="s384">This was complete chaos.</span> <span id="s385">There was no organization.</span> <span id="s386">There was no leadership.</span> <span id="s387">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s388">There was strictly word of killing and surviving - the four weeks that I been in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s389">Everybody’s on his own.</span> <span id="s390">And this what it was.</span> <span id="s391">Was a jungle.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Did your father have any connection with any Zionist organization at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: My father was active before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: As a Zionist leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Well, I don’t know as a Zionist - yeah, I could say yes because he always did want to go to Israel, and supported Israel, and worked on Aliyah Bet.</span> <span id="s396">I can remember that he supported young Jewish kids going to a port called Gadinyeh in Poland, going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: But do you have any recollections of meetings to discuss some sort of organized resistance at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s399">I know my father went to meetings, but I never went with him, so I don’t know what transpired.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So you were telling me about your experience in Auschwitz, and you were how old, 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Fourteen.</span> <span id="s402">Yeah.</span> <span id="s403">In Auschwitz, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s404">Every day people went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s405">There was hunger.</span> <span id="s406">There was not enough to eat.</span> <span id="s407">They used to get us up like 4:00 in the morning, 5:00 in the morning - in the winter as well as in the summer - standing for about an hour, an hour and a half - you cannot move, one way or the other - till we went out to work.</span> <span id="s408">There was no winter clothing, summer clothing, no such thing.</span> <span id="s409">There was no underwear.</span> <span id="s410">There was no socks.</span> <span id="s411">What you been getting is the striped pants and the striped jacket.</span> <span id="s412">In order to survive in the wintertime, I remember, we used to take cement sacks and put in a string on top of the cement sack, and we’d put ‘em two together, and put it over your head, one in the back and one in the front, so to keep you warm.</span> <span id="s413">Paper in your shoes to keep you warm.</span> <span id="s414">And if they catch you with the paper, with the concrete empty sacks, they hanged you for that.</span> <span id="s415">Couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s416">This was stealing.</span> <span id="s417">You recycled the paper, so we couldn’t take that.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: You did work in the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yeah, I worked in the crematorium for about 11 months.</span> <span id="s420">And able to escape from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: How did you escape from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Well, we went in to clean up people from typhus.</span> <span id="s423">There was the infected typhus in Auschwitz - I don’t remember the period, exactly, the time - and we used to go in there with the truck and pick ‘em up.</span> <span id="s424">This would not happen very often, because we never got out from the area from the crematorium.</span> <span id="s425">There was a barrack there, and we lived there.</span> <span id="s426">And they picked us to go in and pick up people from typhus, and this is the way I was able to get away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: But then they brought those bodies into the crematorium for sanitary reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And so it was your task to place the bodies...</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Not - not bodies!</span> <span id="s431">They were still living!</span> <span id="s432">They were still living, except going to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Living corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Living corpses.</span> <span id="s435">Picking ‘em up, getting ‘em to the gas chamber, and then to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: How does a Jewish boy find it in him to do that?</span> <span id="s437">What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Well, at that time, when you with a mass of people, hundreds and thousands, and you fighting for survival, you don’t think how you do it, how you don’t.</span> <span id="s439">You just try to survive if you can.</span> <span id="s440">Any means that’s available to you.</span> <span id="s441">And if they tell you to go and do something, you went to do it.</span> <span id="s442">There was no “yes” or “no.”</span> <span id="s443">There are no choices.</span> <span id="s444">There is no choices in Auschwitz - or in any camp!</span> <span id="s445">And of course in my particular case, I think there was a little easier for me personally, because I didn’t have the ties of a family, which means I didn’t have the tie of my own children.</span> <span id="s446">I didn’t have the tie of having my own wife.</span> <span id="s447">I was young.</span> <span id="s448">I was one of the youngest within Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s449">There were not very many of my age - at all.</span> <span id="s450">A very few - you can count ‘em on your fingers - that came into Auschwitz with 14 years.</span> <span id="s451">I was lucky that I got in.</span> <span id="s452">For some reason the doctor said, “Right, left, left, right,” and I got in there.</span> <span id="s453">But I think if I look back today, I think a part of it for me to easier to survive is because I didn’t have the tie of my own children.</span> <span id="s454">I’m talking about a three-year-old, a five-year-old, a nine-year-old.</span> <span id="s455">Which most of the men had that!</span> <span id="s456">And they morally got broken down in pieces, because they knew that the kid goes into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s457">It’s not a question of guessing.</span> <span id="s458">As you got off from the railroad into Auschwitz, a part of the people went to the left, a part to the right, and this people went to the, to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Wasn’t there always the hope that a wife or a child might have survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: No.</span> <span id="s461">No, there was no hope.</span> <span id="s462">No.</span> <span id="s463">Because if you had an older brother that went into someplace else or didn’t come with you to Auschwitz, then the hope was there that maybe he’s someplace else, and he will survive.</span> <span id="s464">But you have to remember that whole families came into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s465">In my particular case, and a few other cases, there was a separation.</span> <span id="s466">We’d been taken from the street.</span> <span id="s467">But in most cases, they cleaned out complete ghettos!</span> <span id="s468">And the whole families came in.</span> <span id="s469">And so they knew, right there they knew, who is going to the gas chamber and who is not.</span> <span id="s470">It depends on which line you’ve been standing.</span> <span id="s471">And it depends as you got to the doctor which was saying, “Right, left, left, right.”</span> <span id="s472">I mean, you knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Was that Dr. Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Dr. Mengele was one.</span> <span id="s475">He was mostly in the experiments, but the guy that done that was not Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s476">His name slipped my mind, but this was a different doctor that was standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Who had the power of life and death over those who entered the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Had the power of life and death, yeah.</span> <span id="s479">.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: So you did your job, because when faced with a gun, one doesn’t argue.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I done a lot of things.</span> <span id="s482">And also, another thing, I think a lot of the older people, I was like “adopted,” so to speak.</span> <span id="s483">I was little as a young boy, and so everybody had a little bit compassion for me - to help me, you know, survive, look, a young boy in camp.</span> <span id="s484">And this was for the fathers, especially, the people that like children.</span> <span id="s485">So I had to break, so to speak, from this sense.</span> <span id="s486">But then, like I say, I went through every phase in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s487">When you’re there for five years, what is there to talk about it.</span> <span id="s488">I saw Dr. Mengele’s experiments on children - the kids that I knew became vegetables.</span> <span id="s489">And the daily killing: the hanging, the shooting, the crematorium smell.</span> <span id="s490">Day in and day out you could smell it.</span> <span id="s491">The ovens were there, and the smoke is going out, and me being pretty close to it.</span> <span id="s492">And so you really lived with life and death on a day-to-day basis.</span> <span id="s493">I think I was more of the fortunate, in a way or not, in that I was able to see my family.</span> <span id="s494">My father and mother came into Auschwitz in 1944.</span> <span id="s495">And at that time, I had a lot of privileges already.</span> <span id="s496">I was the “old boy” in the camp.</span> <span id="s497">I knew everybody, and I knew every trick in the book to survive.</span> <span id="s498">And so I knew that people are coming from ghetto - from Lodz.</span> <span id="s499">They’ll be arriving in box cars to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s500">So I went out and my mother and father came.</span> <span id="s501">I had a sister - I still have, she lives in Israel - she had a little child.</span> <span id="s502">And everybody that had a child on his hand, went automatically to the oven.</span> <span id="s503">Two years, three years, four years, five years, nine months, six months, it didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s504">It didn’t make any differences if you’re 19 years old or you’re 10 years old or 20 years old as far as the person that carried the child.</span> <span id="s505">Whoever carried the child went automatically to the oven, with the child.</span> <span id="s506">This is the way it was handled in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s507">So my mother took the child, a young boy, I don’t remember if it would be a year, year-and-a-half at that time.</span> <span id="s508">And she automatically went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s509">My sister, till today, is suffering from that, because she feels that she was a part of killing my mother - because she took the child.</span> <span id="s510">My living sister which lives today in Israel, she never overcame the fact that my mother carried the child, because she gave it to my mother.</span> <span id="s511">She carried some other stuff, and she gave the child to my mother.</span> <span id="s512">And so till today she suffers from that, and she’s never the same person - not the same person.</span> <span id="s513">I went over to my father.</span> <span id="s514">My mother was on the other side.</span> <span id="s515">I just waved to my mother.</span> <span id="s516">My father was staying in line.</span> <span id="s517">So I went over to my father and I says, “Day, where’s God?</span> <span id="s518">All the teaching what you teach me: We’re the chosen people.”</span> <span id="s519">I says, “They kill rabbis, priests, ministers - the more religious, the faster they go!</span> <span id="s520">What has happened?”</span> <span id="s521">His only answer to me was “Look, my son, this is the way God wants it and this is the way it’s gonna be.”</span> <span id="s522">And this was the end of the conversation, him knowing that he’s gonna die, because he was in the line going to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s523">Well I don’t know how he felt inside, but outside, I tell you, religion must have a tremendous power, because he didn’t show it.</span> <span id="s524">And his only answer to me was, “This is the way God wants it and this is the way it’s gonna be.”</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: He was a true teacher, wasn’t he?</span> <span id="s526">The true spirit of the rabbi is the teacher.</span> <span id="s527">And he was passing a value on to you, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: This what it is.</span> <span id="s529">Simple like that.</span> <span id="s530">There must be something with it, you know.</span> <span id="s531">A lot of soldiers on the first line fighting wars turn religious, so religious has some kind of a power, I guess.</span> <span id="s532">But this was the last time I spoke to my father.</span> <span id="s533">Well, in Auschwitz, as you’re probably aware of it, all together, 12,000,000 were killed.</span> <span id="s534">6,000,000 of this were Jews.</span> <span id="s535">And the rest were all different nationalities: French and Poles and gypsies and all that.</span> <span id="s536">In 1943, 1944, they brought in gypsies.</span> <span id="s537">They cleaned ‘em out.</span> <span id="s538">I don’t know where they brought ‘em from, from Romania, Hungary, Poland, whatever, and they injected typhus - intentionally.</span> <span id="s539">And they killed out, literally, thousands of women, children and men, just killed ‘em out.</span> <span id="s540">And so this is an episode that I witnessed.</span> <span id="s541">Besides the daily life in Auschwitz - which we know all about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Did you have any contact with other non-Jewish prisoners?</span> <span id="s543">Political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s545">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Those who had worked for Jews?</span> <span id="s547">Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Well, there were political prisoners in there.</span> <span id="s549">We all had different signs, what is political or homosexuals, and the criminals, and you name it.</span> <span id="s550">Each one had a different star on him, and so you could identify them.</span> <span id="s551">And most of the gentiles, they had...</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Now I think you’re saying, the Jews had the star, and the gentile prisoners had some other badge of identification?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: The political had other badges, right.</span> <span id="s554">They were different colors.</span> <span id="s555">If you saw somebody, you know he’s a political prisoner, or he’s a homosexual, or he is whatever, because Hitler cleaned out all the homosexuals, brought them in, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Did you find that people were communicating with each other no matter what their nationality or background?</span> <span id="s557">Or that there was a drawing together of people in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No, there was no drawing together in the camp.</span> <span id="s559">In the camp was survival.</span> <span id="s560">You maybe had one or two friends, which was very important for your survival.</span> <span id="s561">But everybody was fighting for his own life.</span> <span id="s562">There was no communication.</span> <span id="s563">There was no pity for somebody.</span> <span id="s564">You know, it was a daily-type life.</span> <span id="s565">People were lying there dying, and this is it!</span> <span id="s566">In fact, we used to say, “Look at how lucky he is.</span> <span id="s567">This is it.</span> <span id="s568">He doesn’t have to suffer anymore.”</span> <span id="s569">Death was actually a luxury.</span> <span id="s570">I got a little medal that I carry in my pocket, which says, “I remember times when death was a luxury.”</span> <span id="s571">And this is what it was!</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: And did you witness people becoming brutalized?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: As if they were accepting the indignities as a natural course of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s576">I’m not a philosopher, I’m not a psychologist.</span> <span id="s577">But I think what I went through in living with thousands and hundred-thousands of people, I’m a pretty good psychiatrist and psychologist, I think I can figure out people pretty good.</span> <span id="s578">I also came to the conclusion that circumstances guide our life a lot - more than how you’ve been brought up, what you learn, or all the ethics.</span> <span id="s579">It doesn’t play a role once you start fighting for your life.</span> <span id="s580">Once you start fighting for survival, all the ethics are gone.</span> <span id="s581">And you live by circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So you don’t subscribe to that school of philosophy that says you can be a human being no matter where you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Not really...</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: That you don’t really have to submit to the law of the jungle.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: I..</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">I..</span> <span id="s588">.</span> <span id="s589">I..</span> <span id="s590">.</span> <span id="s591">well, it depends upon the circumstances.</span> <span id="s592">You can be a human being under normal conditions.</span> <span id="s593">When I say, “I want you to do this and that,” and you have a choice and you go home and sleep about it and think it over, it’s a whole different set of circumstances.</span> <span id="s594">But when you’re talking you have to deal with hunger - and with survival - and with thirst - and with cold - and with heat - and physically draw down to the point where you cannot mentally think any more, where the only thing is the survival, and maybe have a little hope, if I survive, I’m gonna be with my grandchildren and tell ‘em the story and all that, something to hope for, then the prescription is that you still can be a human being?</span> <span id="s595">No, you are not.</span> <span id="s596">In fact, let me make a point to you, and I think we can elaborate later.</span> <span id="s597">The fact of the matter is that the more intellectual you were, the more animal you became in the camps.</span> <span id="s598">The fact of the matter is that people that grew up not being intellectual, suffered a little bit at home, had to go to work every day, had to sweat 19 hours a day working to make a living, these people adapt a little bit easier than the intellectual coming in there - the professor, the school teacher, the piano player and all that - under the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Those were the people who broke down.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Those are the people who broke down.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: They couldn’t do what you had to do to survive.</span> <span id="s602">Then those people who passively accepted the reality as God’s will, and said, “God wants this to happen,” these were the ones who were not likely to take the measures to ensure their survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: To a certain point.</span> <span id="s604">You know, if you say that this particular people - the fanatics, religious fanatics - which decided that their life is in God’s hand, that what he wants, this is what’s gonna happen.</span> <span id="s605">I’m sure it’s a little easier, because I think it lies in human nature to have a little hope.</span> <span id="s606">And so to them, this was the easier thing to, to reach to God.</span> <span id="s607">And I’m not saying right or wrong, I think it’s a fantastic tool...to die or to live a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: But those weren’t the people who survived, for the most part, from what you’re saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Those were not the people that survived.</span> <span id="s610">They died out of hunger, they died of cold, they died of a whole lot of things that thousands of people died.</span> <span id="s611">They went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s612">You have to remember there used to be a pattern.</span> <span id="s613">They made use of you.</span> <span id="s614">First way, you didn’t have the food.</span> <span id="s615">You had very little food to eat, very, very little.</span> <span id="s616">And you been out going to work, and as you became not useful any more - besides, as you came into Auschwitz, the elderly, the kids, the mothers, the pregnant women and all that, the “undesirables,” so to speak, they all went right off the bat to the crematorium, and then the other part that got into camp, you worked until you can no longer function - and then you went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s617">And so there was a cycle of elimination.</span> <span id="s618">They make use of you as they can, then you cannot work.</span> <span id="s619">And some of us that survived, learned how to steal and how to risk their life, because it really didn’t mean much to live or to die, you know.</span> <span id="s620">Under normal conditions, I wouldn’t be here.</span> <span id="s621">I apparently learned at a very young age how to survive.</span> <span id="s622">And I was close to death.</span> <span id="s623">How I lived, is behind me today.</span> <span id="s624">When I look back at things that I used to do, and risk my life...but this is what survival does to you.</span> <span id="s625">I don’t think you will find 20 people alive today with my group that came into Auschwitz in 1940.</span> <span id="s626">I keep on looking.</span> <span id="s627">I found two guys in Brooklyn - that’s all - living, from the group that I got in in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Are you part of an organized group now that searches for survivors and makes contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Well, I belong to the Holocaust...what do you call it...which just formed not long ago in Washington.</span> <span id="s630">And I travel.</span> <span id="s631">I always look for people, if I can find somebody.</span> <span id="s632">Although you have to remember, my connections from home are very, very small, because I went away as a young boy.</span> <span id="s633">My connections are the people that survived in concentration camp, or survivors today that are alive, that we have something in common that we can talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So from the start, then, after your release, there was a real need to communicate with those who had shared that experience, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s636">We’re still today, because you cannot talk to anybody that really can...can soak in.</span> <span id="s637">For example, when the film Holocaust was shown, I was very upset because there was never should given the name “Holocaust,” because it was not one-tenth shown what really went on.</span> <span id="s638">I think it was a disgrace to give this film the name “Holocaust.”</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Do you think there was an intent to distort and to deny reality?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: I don’t know if it was “distort.”</span> <span id="s641">I think the word “Holocaust” for this whole episode going around two families which was shown, it’s a distortion.</span> <span id="s642">Intentional or not intentional, it is just not the true what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: If you tell the truth, it’s no longer entertainment, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s645">I don’t know what it is, but this was not what I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Well, it seems as if...this culture and other societies have had great difficulty in dealing with reality - a movement today to alter history and pretend that it didn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: This what is happening, I guess.</span> <span id="s648">Well, this is now.</span> <span id="s649">But let me just give you a little bit what happened later.</span> <span id="s650">I got out in 1945.</span> <span id="s651">We...</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Excuse me, do you remember the names of the major German personnel at your camp?</span> <span id="s653">The commander and the officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Well, you got Dr. Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Was he the commander of the camp, or simply the doctor in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: He was the doctor in charge of the hospital, of all the experiments that he done.</span> <span id="s657">I don’t remember all their names, you know.</span> <span id="s658">In my particular case, there were changes, so many changes.</span> <span id="s659">But I remember Eichmann coming in - visited us.</span> <span id="s660">Very nice guy, as you know.</span> <span id="s661">(Laughs) And you know, other visitors.</span> <span id="s662">I know Goering came in once to visit the camp.</span> <span id="s663">But as far as remembering all of ‘em - I’ve got it written down some names, but I don’t really remember right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s665">Now you escaped again from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: You transferred to other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I was in Auschwitz then - for good.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You were in Auschwitz until the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span> <span id="s671">Before the liberation - which was a few months ahead of time - the Germans liquidated Auschwitz, because the Russians start coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s672">So they took us out what’s called the “death march.”</span> <span id="s673">If you gonna talk to survivors, they can tell you about what the death march is.</span> <span id="s674">And I wind up at Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Were you there when they were actually destroying the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: You were taken out before that.</span> <span id="s678">Okay, tell me about the death march.</span> <span id="s679">The “dead march” or the “death march?”</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Death march.</span> <span id="s681">You know you have to be careful with my accent.</span> <span id="s682">Well, they took you out and they put you in railroad boxes.</span> <span id="s683">They put in 125 guys in there.</span> <span id="s684">You cannot sit, you cannot stand, you cannot lay.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Were they sealed?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: You’re sealed.</span> <span id="s687">And people died in there.</span> <span id="s688">And they went with the back and forth.</span> <span id="s689">This was actually just to eliminate us - as simple like that.</span> <span id="s690">So the railroad was going in one direction one day, and then going back the same direction the other day.</span> <span id="s691">No food.</span> <span id="s692">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s693">Every day we cleaned out the dead, put ‘em in the back boxes - railroad trucks (cars) - and fill out again 125, take out the live people in back and fill in the boxes again.</span> <span id="s694">I would say you had hundreds of cars - railroad cars - where we were in there.</span> <span id="s695">There were literally thousands and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s696">I don’t know if it was 50,000, 60,000, 100,000.</span> <span id="s697">I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s698">But it was a lot, a lot of people.</span> <span id="s699">People froze to death, and they died in there, for hunger, whatever.</span> <span id="s700">I remember, we wind up in Prague one night.</span> <span id="s701">We were able to open up the boxes and we got out.</span> <span id="s702">And then once of a sudden, they gave us something to eat, and what they gave us is herring - salt herring.</span> <span id="s703">Was barrels, full of herring.</span> <span id="s704">And this was a luxury.</span> <span id="s705">And we said at that time, “My God, look at the Germans!</span> <span id="s706">They getting to be good people!</span> <span id="s707">That’s really something!</span> <span id="s708">Before they weren’t.”</span> <span id="s709">After everybody was eating herring - just as much as you can - they closed us in the boxes.</span> <span id="s710">No water, and nothing.</span> <span id="s711">And this was terrible.</span> <span id="s712">And this is a fact: people used to drink their own urine.</span> <span id="s713">This is as bad as it was.</span> <span id="s714">And then they took us out from the boxes; and I don’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s715">And we were marching!</span> <span id="s716">Night and days.</span> <span id="s717">We were marching.</span> <span id="s718">People were dying.</span> <span id="s719">The people that couldn’t march, they shot ‘em right there - wherever - they left ‘em lay there!</span> <span id="s720">It was before the war start coming to an end, and so they used to shot the people that couldn’t walk any more.</span> <span id="s721">Literally in the thousands died on this march, because they couldn’t - they couldn’t physically walk.</span> <span id="s722">When we were before cities, they used to put ‘em on trucks and cars and whatever they could find and bring ‘em into the city, and shoot ‘em.</span> <span id="s723">And we kept on marching.</span> <span id="s724">And I wind up in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s725">And I got liberated in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: How long were you in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s728">Must be about three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Now were the circumstances better there?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: No, the circumstances were not better.</span> <span id="s731">It was a little bit better in a sense that we have a little small crematorium.</span> <span id="s732">The difference was that the killing was not as extensive, except that they cut off the water and they cut off the food.</span> <span id="s733">Also, they took out all the people from the camp and tried to transport ‘em someplace.</span> <span id="s734">And so every day, you used to hear in German, “Achtung!</span> <span id="s735">Achtung!</span> <span id="s736">Alle Juden entreden!”</span> <span id="s737">Which means, “Attention!</span> <span id="s738">Attention!</span> <span id="s739">All Jews get together!”</span> <span id="s740">And so they didn’t give you anything to eat or to drink.</span> <span id="s741">They cut off the water, the food, everything.</span> <span id="s742">Then you went out wherever they want you to go.</span> <span id="s743">This means they tried to clean out Buchenwald, liquidate Buchenwald, as they liquidated Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s744">So whoever went out on this march, on the gate they gave you a piece of salami and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s745">And a lot of people in Buchenwald, they all went.</span> <span id="s746">I hid.</span> <span id="s747">I hid underneath the barracks, but I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s748">And there’s one fellow alive in Germany - he lives today in Germany - and one guy’s in Israel today living... Well, we survived together in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s749">We opened up a septic hole, and we crawled in there.</span> <span id="s750">And we’re laying there for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: In other words, you didn’t trust the purposes of this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: No.</span> <span id="s753">I know I’m going, I’m dead.</span> <span id="s754">The fact of the matter is, that they took the people out and took ‘em into Weimar, which is a city next to it which is big forests, and they machine gunned ‘em all.</span> <span id="s755">The didn’t go nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: So it was your instincts, really, that preserved you.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Well, a part of my survival is instinct.</span> <span id="s758">Till today, I guess.</span> <span id="s759">I wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s760">I’d rather die in the camp, because I knew what it is.</span> <span id="s761">And also, physically, I couldn’t handle it any more.</span> <span id="s762">I could barely walk.</span> <span id="s763">And a lot of people I warned, and they didn’t go!</span> <span id="s764">And they survived!</span> <span id="s765">I said, “Don’t go!</span> <span id="s766">Just don’t go.</span> <span id="s767">You’re not gonna make it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: You had the choice of refusing?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: No!</span> <span id="s770">You had to hide!</span> <span id="s771">You had to hide!!</span> <span id="s772">You hid wherever you can, in all corners.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So, what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Well, as I got liberated - which I don’t know much about it at all, because I just passed out - they dragged me out of the septic, and I wind up in Marseilles in a hospital.</span> <span id="s775">The American military took me and flew me to Marseilles, to a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s777">But you have no recollection of being found.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No recollection of anything.</span> <span id="s779">The only thing I have, the night before, that I felt real good listening to the guns closer and closer.</span> <span id="s780">When America attacked, it was a real good feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Remarkable.</span> <span id="s782">So you would up in a hospital in Marseilles.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: And then as I recuperated... Of course after that I went back to Germany and begin to travel all over, looking for people, like anybody else.</span> <span id="s784">Looking for my sister, which I couldn’t find her.</span> <span id="s785">I forgot the name of my older brother, an older brother, committed suicide in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s786">He felt that because his wife doesn’t live, his children are gone - he know they died - he felt that, even if he survived, there’s nothing for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Nothing to live for.</span> <span id="s788">Did you witness his suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: No, I didn’t witness the actual suicide.</span> <span id="s790">I witnessed that he was talking to me a day before, because that was not something that happened just like that.</span> <span id="s791">He was thinking of doing it!</span> <span id="s792">He couldn’t take the cold, he couldn’t take the hunger, and he couldn’t live with the fact that his wife is dead and his children are dead.</span> <span id="s793">And so he told me, “You remember, you’ve got an aunt living and her name is so-and-so.</span> <span id="s794">And you’ve got a cousin in America by the name of so-and-so.”</span> <span id="s795">And when I survived, I couldn’t remember - for three years - after the survival - I couldn’t remember the name Solski, which was my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s796">I just couldn’t remember it.</span> <span id="s797">Blocked out completely.</span> <span id="s798">One night in a dream, the name came back to me.</span> <span id="s799">And this is the way I found my aunt later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: You were truly a displaced person when you got out of that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: What was that sensation like?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Remember again, I was very young.</span> <span id="s804">I was 19 years old when I got liberated.</span> <span id="s805">19 years old.</span> <span id="s806">Having nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Were you getting some support from HIAS at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s809">HIAS and IRO.</span> <span id="s810">The Jewish community begin to organize themselves and you start immediately, somehow, put your life together.</span> <span id="s811">But we been busy for probably two-and-a-half to three years to find people!</span> <span id="s812">Hoping somebody maybe survived.</span> <span id="s813">Again, there’s the hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: So you were traveling at that point?</span> <span id="s815">Or did you establish any kind of base?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: No.</span> <span id="s817">At that time, I was living in Germany, a town they call Fulda.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: How were you able to go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Well, this is all the place you can go.</span> <span id="s820">You had to go!</span> <span id="s821">There was no other place to be at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: That was a D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Right.</span> <span id="s824">And then I went out on my own.</span> <span id="s825">Then I lived in Fulda, I lived in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: You began to find jobs and to support yourself?</span> <span id="s827">Or HIAS provided for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: HIAS provided in the beginning.</span> <span id="s829">I also worked for the American government, for the military, as an interpreter, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s830">And then I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Was your wife a camp survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: She was in Breslau in a working camp.</span> <span id="s835">There were 800 people there.</span> <span id="s836">She’s half Jewish, so she had a chance in Breslau.</span> <span id="s837">At that time, there was a group of 800 people that the Germans kept, working for the hospitals in Germany.</span> <span id="s838">So it was like, not a camp, but a working little ghetto, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: And how did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I met her in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s842">And then you settled where?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Later on, I settled in Israel.</span> <span id="s844">I lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s845">And later on I worked for the Brichah, smuggled ammunition for Israel, and all.</span> <span id="s846">I don’t think this...on tape is not...</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: I think that is really relevant, that as a camp survivor, you felt a necessity to work for Israeli survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Well...Yeah.</span> <span id="s849">I had been working very close with the Brichah.</span> <span id="s850">I got into the mechanical right away, with buying equipment for kibbutzim, where they needed it, and also transporting.</span> <span id="s851">I had a transport company in Germany later on, where I been transporting Aliyah Bet all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: The people who were going to Israel to make aliyah.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s854">Bring ‘em to Belgium, to France, go picking up, and transporting to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: So that became a very important goal for you then?</span> <span id="s856">To help other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: At that time, sure, absolutely.</span> <span id="s858">It still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: What did Israel represent for you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: A homeland!</span> <span id="s861">Israel represents that this is a place, till today, that I think you cannot feel as good as you can feel in Israel as a Jew.</span> <span id="s862">It’s simple like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: And a chance for young people to start out in a new world.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: A chance for young people to start out in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: So finding those survivors and those who chose to go to Israel, became something that was meaningful for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Right.</span> <span id="s867">I was heavily involved in “Exodus.”</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Would you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: I brought the people to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s870">Then they went from Hamburg to Haifa.</span> <span id="s871">They sent them back.</span> <span id="s872">They wind up in a camp with the British, in Germany.</span> <span id="s873">And I transported food and clothing.</span> <span id="s874">My wife was a big help.</span> <span id="s875">She would go with me all the time on that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: What was the organization that you were working with at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Well, the organization I’d been working with was the Brichah, actually, which was the Jewish military, taking on a responsibility of helping Jewish people going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Then you came to this country, obviously.</span> <span id="s879">Under what circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: 1956, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: What made you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Well, what made me come here is a lot of things.</span> <span id="s883">The thing that made me come here, mainly, is we had an ambush, by Arabs.</span> <span id="s884">We were eight people...I had a fantastic job in Israel.</span> <span id="s885">I built one of the biggest irrigation plants in the world.</span> <span id="s886">I had a part in that.</span> <span id="s887">In fact, Leo visits me up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Leo?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Leo Gross.</span> <span id="s890">Leo Gross in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s891">Leo Gross that owns G &amp; K!</span> <span id="s892">You don’t know Leo Gross?</span> <span id="s893">Who doesn’t know Leo Gross?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: I don’t.</span> <span id="s895">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Going through five years concentration camp, and then, in Israel at that time, you had the Arabs attacks, from the Istananim, which were the terrorists, coming in.</span> <span id="s897">Now remember, we’re talking about ‘55, ‘54, ‘53, ‘52, ‘51, this period.</span> <span id="s898">What happened is that we went from a birthday party - I took friends of mine back - I lived in Ashkelon...</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: At what year did you arrive in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: In ‘49.</span> <span id="s901">So I took friends of mine, with their children, to Migdal, which is about four miles from Ashkelon.</span> <span id="s902">And we had an attack, an ambush, with machine guns shooting at us.</span> <span id="s903">And my older daughter was ten years old at that time, had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s904">And so did the people that were with me in the truck.</span> <span id="s905">Because we were so far (indicates with hands) from being dead.</span> <span id="s906">The machine gun was not adjusted properly, so most of the bullets went into the ground, rather than into the tires.</span> <span id="s907">He was sitting in a valley.</span> <span id="s908">A truck behind us that came, which was military, they got hit.</span> <span id="s909">Killed three people, killed a girl.</span> <span id="s910">In fact, I stopped and took one of the girls to the hospital.</span> <span id="s911">She passed away later on.</span> <span id="s912">And so mainly this had to do with the ambush on us.</span> <span id="s913">And so the doctor said, “You have to get out of here, and get away from this atmosphere.”</span> <span id="s914">I make it sound simpler than it really was.</span> <span id="s915">I’m not going to go into a lot of details.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: What happened to your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Well, my daughter, like I say, she had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s918">She was scared to death.</span> <span id="s919">She couldn’t sleep at night.</span> <span id="s920">Every time shooting was, she was out of her mind.</span> <span id="s921">She was the best in school, and she couldn’t concentrate at all.</span> <span id="s922">She’d been listening to news every day.</span> <span id="s923">She was trembling!</span> <span id="s924">And the only thing was to get out of Israel and come here to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Was she hospitalized?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: She was hospitalized, yes, for a very short period of time.</span> <span id="s927">In fact, I tell you, when we were on the ship, coming to this country, her question was, “Is there terrorists, too, in America?”</span> <span id="s928">And this type of thing.</span> <span id="s929">But I actually came just to be here five years.</span> <span id="s930">That was my goal.</span> <span id="s931">To remain here for five years and go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Because I did want to live in Israel.</span> <span id="s934">And as I came here, I found another experience that was not very pleasant.</span> <span id="s935">And the experience was that my daughter was ten years old when she came to this country.</span> <span id="s936">She was the best in school up there.</span> <span id="s937">She spoke a perfect Hebrew and German and Yiddish - which she still does.</span> <span id="s938">She came here, she started out with no English at all.</span> <span id="s939">I spoke very little English.</span> <span id="s940">My English was more in the professional side - looking at prints and this type of thing, but conversation, I’m still, as you see, very rusty with my grammar.</span> <span id="s941">But my daughter had nothing!</span> <span id="s942">And now she has to go with first graders, to go to school!</span> <span id="s943">And this was a very, very painful experience.</span> <span id="s944">It took her about two year and she was the best.</span> <span id="s945">And she just jumped classes from one to the other.</span> <span id="s946">But she always wanted to go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s947">And I said, “When you finish high school, I’m gonna send you back.”</span> <span id="s948">She finished high school, she came home, there was a ticket behind her pillow.</span> <span id="s949">And she went back to Israel.</span> <span id="s950">She’s now back here, but she lived there.</span> <span id="s951">And so my little one - that was three years old when we came here - then she had to go to school.</span> <span id="s952">We decided we’re not gonna to do this.</span> <span id="s953">Now she spoke English and no Hebrew!</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: So you wanted to give your family some kind of stability, so they wouldn’t be living on the run as you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Right.</span> <span id="s956">And I’d be traveling a lot.</span> <span id="s957">I’ve got three daughters - each one born a different country.</span> <span id="s958">This will give you some idea.</span> <span id="s959">I had jobs all over the world - in Africa, in Burma.</span> <span id="s960">In Israel I had a job which took me all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: At this point, what are your feelings about human nature, having witnessed all of these events?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Well, when I was younger, I handled it a lot more easier than I can handle this whole episode the last five or six years.</span> <span id="s963">Probably a part of it ought to do when I was younger, I had to strive for making a living, and the family, and trying to reach all the “goodies” in life, because I realized, life is not forever, so you want to make the best you can of a certain period of time.</span> <span id="s964">The other thing, I don’t have uncles and cousins and aunts and everybody else.</span> <span id="s965">I have to rely on my own ability to do the things that I have to do.</span> <span id="s966">But as you get older, and I’m sure that if this is what happened with me, it happened with everybody else: this whole thing becomes very painful.</span> <span id="s967">It doesn’t go away.</span> <span id="s968">In fact, it becomes more painful than ever.</span> <span id="s969">You now begin to think about your brothers.</span> <span id="s970">You begin to think more about the children that went to the crematorium, and their faces.</span> <span id="s971">I sleep at night, I can hear the screaming and hollering, it drives me nuts!</span> <span id="s972">I have to get up.</span> <span id="s973">Many nights I don’t sleep.</span> <span id="s974">So it begins to work on you much, much more than you would say as you came out!</span> <span id="s975">There’s a reverse.</span> <span id="s976">The older you get, it becomes more and more painful - at least in my case.</span> <span id="s977">Then you begin to think about the children.</span> <span id="s978">You got three children.</span> <span id="s979">They don’t know what is mean a grandfather.</span> <span id="s980">They don’t know what is mean a cousin.</span> <span id="s981">My friends in St. Paul are their uncles and aunts - friends.</span> <span id="s982">So this begins to bother you.</span> <span id="s983">They really didn’t grow up under normal type... Fortunately, we are a very close-knit family, and there’s something in our house that we have to offer: being good parents, and all this type of thing that goes with it.</span> <span id="s984">And I’m very lucky.</span> <span id="s985">I have pretty good children - all three of them.</span> <span id="s986">So I’m lucky from this way.</span> <span id="s987">So now this begins to work on you.</span> <span id="s988">Look, they grew up, no cousins, no uncles, no aunts, no Passover sitting as a family.</span> <span id="s989">If we Seder, it’s all our friends.</span> <span id="s990">And this becomes a very painful experience.</span> <span id="s991">A very painful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: I guess maybe that’s why the continuation of the connection with Israel and with other Jews all over the world, is important.</span> <span id="s993">That gives you a sense of community, doesn’t it.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s995">There’s nothing with religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: No.</span> <span id="s997">But a sense of extended family...</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Absolutely!</span> <span id="s999">People always important in our life.</span> <span id="s1000">I believe in that!</span> <span id="s1001">I’m a people’s person.</span> <span id="s1002">It may be something good or bad.</span> <span id="s1003">I’m not isolated.</span> <span id="s1004">I never lived for myself - all my life never lived for myself.</span> <span id="s1005">I’m a little smarter today, I do a few things for myself, but my life was always for everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Is that why the pain of that concentration camp experience has grown more intense over the years - because you have this sensitivity toward other people?</span> <span id="s1007">I mean, have you come to terms, really, with what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Well, I don’t know if there’s more or less.</span> <span id="s1009">I know that people that came out from concentration camp, some of them are literally going nuts, are mentally disturbed.</span> <span id="s1010">Maybe because some of my work...I cannot answer that.</span> <span id="s1011">I just can say that this whole episode of concentration camp, as you grow older, you start taking it apart more in detail.</span> <span id="s1012">And it comes back to you!</span> <span id="s1013">It begins to haunt you more!</span> <span id="s1014">Like I say, you know, about your parents, about your brother.</span> <span id="s1015">Faces come back to you!</span> <span id="s1016">Faces that went to the gas chambers!</span> <span id="s1017">Certain faces just come back to you!</span> <span id="s1018">You see ‘em!</span> <span id="s1019">The screaming!</span> <span id="s1020">The hollering!</span> <span id="s1021">And the few seconds when they throw in the gas in the chamber before the people - the people were seized.</span> <span id="s1022">The screaming and the hollering of the women and kids and men.</span> <span id="s1023">You hear that - this voices!</span> <span id="s1024">You know, I was a happy, lucky guy!</span> <span id="s1025">I mean, I survived, and I felt pretty good about it.</span> <span id="s1026">And then you go through a period - which I go through - you feel guilty living!</span> <span id="s1027">You actually feel guilty!</span> <span id="s1028">And so, right, wrong, I don’t have the answers.</span> <span id="s1029">But this is what is happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: You judge yourself?</span> <span id="s1031">In terms of your behavior - to survive?</span> <span id="s1032">Is this what one does?</span> <span id="s1033">The “survivor’s guilt” concept?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: I don’t know if you can call it “judging.”</span> <span id="s1035">I don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s1036">I think for this we need a little bit more taking it in detail.</span> <span id="s1037">I’m giving you more in generality.</span> <span id="s1038">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1039">I don’t have any labels for that.</span> <span id="s1040">I don’t know if I “judge” myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: But the discomfort grows more intense over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1043">There is no question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: How about the belief in Judaism and the connection with organized religion here in this community?</span> <span id="s1045">Has your practice of Judaism and your belief in Judaism continued strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Well, my kids all went to Talmud Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Are they willing to hear about your experiences?</span> <span id="s1048">Are they willing to listen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: My kids?</span> <span id="s1050">When they’re small, I didn’t do much with that.</span> <span id="s1051">I’ve been speaking in their schools.</span> <span id="s1052">I gave a lot of talks.</span> <span id="s1053">One of them was in the schools.</span> <span id="s1054">And as they get older, more and more we talk about it.</span> <span id="s1055">As they were younger, is really no reason - nothing to talk about.</span> <span id="s1056">My kids - all of ‘em - been in Israel.</span> <span id="s1057">My daughter just came back.</span> <span id="s1058">And the whole subject, in Israel, she related very good to that, was what happened to the Jews in Auschwitz and all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Your young people are willing to deal with the reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1061">I wouldn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s1062">I think a part of my suffering was because I was bottling it in me.</span> <span id="s1063">I always talked in generality what happened, but never about myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: As you pointed out, there was almost nobody that one could share it with, who could really understand except somebody who had lived through it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Well I felt there’s really maybe some mistake, maybe not.</span> <span id="s1066">You know, people do not understand it.</span> <span id="s1067">We’re kidding ourself.</span> <span id="s1068">I talk to a lot of Jewish - people - I’m not talking now about things - I talk to a lot of Jewish people, born American people, and you can feel in conversations that there’s really not so much an interesting subject to them.</span> <span id="s1069">They listen, but they really don’t relate!</span> <span id="s1070">I mean, “So what?”</span> <span id="s1071">You know?</span> <span id="s1072">And I don’t blame it!</span> <span id="s1073">I think it’s probably, maybe, they don’t really understand!</span> <span id="s1074">They can’t understand it!</span> <span id="s1075">And it’s hard to understand!</span> <span id="s1076">Sometimes myself, when I sit by myself, when I go out on the water - I’ve got a place up north - and I’ve got a lot of time to think, it’s hard for me even to understand the truth of this whole thing.</span> <span id="s1077">Did it really happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: What about the books on the Holocaust - other than the Gerald Green story?</span> <span id="s1079">Do you think those accurately depict the events?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1082">So you don’t feel that there’s a systematic effort to deny the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Is not enough written.</span> <span id="s1084">There is no detail written, because there’s...you know, where do you...where do you find in a book that in Buchenwald, Ilse Koch took pregnant women and put ‘em down against a wall and have a hose, with a regulator, and try to get pressure until till it makes a hole in your stomach?</span> <span id="s1085">Now where do you have this in a book?</span> <span id="s1086">I saw that!</span> <span id="s1087">I mean, it’s a whole variety of things that happened in Auschwitz besides just going to the crematorium!</span> <span id="s1088">You know?</span> <span id="s1089">Where do you see that?</span> <span id="s1090">I used to carry the food for the dogs.</span> <span id="s1091">Isle Koch used to have a bunch of dogs.</span> <span id="s1092">I had to steal a bone - to lick it - before I gave it to the dogs.</span> <span id="s1093">Where do you have that?</span> <span id="s1094">And if they catch me, they would kill me for that.</span> <span id="s1095">I mean there’s so many hidden things that is impossible, you know?</span> <span id="s1096">What do you have about the children of the gypsies?</span> <span id="s1097">Where do you have 8,000 Polish kids they brought in?</span> <span id="s1098">Trucks with Polish kids!</span> <span id="s1099">And they killed ‘em all.</span> <span id="s1100">Non-Jewish Polish kids - and they gassed them all.</span> <span id="s1101">Where do you have in a camp in Flossenburg, where I was just a few weeks in there.</span> <span id="s1102">They brought in Russian soldiers, what the Germans captured.</span> <span id="s1103">They brought ‘em in to Flossenburg, shot ‘em, and we put ‘em down on wooden logs, and they burned ‘em - over 25,000!</span> <span id="s1104">Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1105">War prisoners.</span> <span id="s1106">Where do you got that?</span> <span id="s1107">So there’s a whole variety of things is in there.</span> <span id="s1108">And I’m sure that each one had his own little thing he went through on a private basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Of course the propensity to hate and destroy, perhaps, others who were different, isn’t exclusive with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1110">They just carried it to extremes.</span> <span id="s1111">But you see some of the same tendencies in this country, don’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Well, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: There’s a riot this week in Massachusetts, and whites turned against Hispanics.</span> <span id="s1114">What do you think about the potential for violence...</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: The potential for violence in this country is much greater than in any other country in the world.</span> <span id="s1116">Not of violence - anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1117">Let me explain why I say that.</span> <span id="s1118">People in this country live fairly good - the majority of people.</span> <span id="s1119">I think it’s a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s1120">I don’t think there’s a country in the world that can offer as much freedom as this country can offer, or the general philosophy of democracy.</span> <span id="s1121">But the truth of the matter is, let’s take a few things what happened here.</span> <span id="s1122">Let’s follow the history here that you know better than I do!</span> <span id="s1123">How long ago in this country was a colored person not able to go to school?</span> <span id="s1124">How long ago was it?</span> <span id="s1125">Was in your life time and mine.</span> <span id="s1126">No drinking from the same fountain.</span> <span id="s1127">Sitting in the back of the bus.</span> <span id="s1128">How long ago?</span> <span id="s1129">Just yesterday!</span> <span id="s1130">How long ago was this what General Mills didn’t hire a Jewish person here in Minneapolis?</span> <span id="s1131">How long ago that American Hoist and Derrick didn’t hire Jewish people?</span> <span id="s1132">How long ago was this that you had the Bund in this country - the Nazi organization of the Second World war?</span> <span id="s1133">What is the name of the minister or priest that went around talking against Jews, right in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Father Coughlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Father Coughlin.</span> <span id="s1136">The truth of the matter is, the Ku Klux Klan is not outlawed here.</span> <span id="s1137">The truth of the matter is that the Nazi Party existed here.</span> <span id="s1138">I don’t care, anybody may say, “Well, these small and de-dah-de-dah...” The fact of the matter that they exist, they’re working!</span> <span id="s1139">This country is supplying anti-Semite material to the whole world - comes out of his country - they’re printing it here, and they’re shipping it all over!</span> <span id="s1140">Right from this country.</span> <span id="s1141">But getting back to the first point that I made, that this country is more prone than any other is because two things: People live here pretty good.</span> <span id="s1142">They make a pretty good living.</span> <span id="s1143">It’s the mechanic, the janitor, the driver, the machinist, you name it, whoever it is.</span> <span id="s1144">And what you need here is the economy turn a little sour, and have one person to go up and give the propaganda, which works all over.</span> <span id="s1145">With 65% of the population, the propaganda works.</span> <span id="s1146">Well, with 65% the propaganda works, the other 30 or 35% is powerless to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1147">And this where the danger lies here.</span> <span id="s1148">And so you can always get the mass here much faster to go along: “The Jews are the richest, the Jews take away your money, the Jews do this...” or whatever the propaganda may be.</span> <span id="s1149">“Look at the children, they’re all professors and doctors.</span> <span id="s1150">Why do you think they have that?</span> <span id="s1151">Because they - from you money, from you blood.”</span> <span id="s1152">Propaganda is dangerous.</span> <span id="s1153">You know that.</span> <span id="s1154">The oldest propaganda is worse than bullets.</span> <span id="s1155">So you got the material here.</span> <span id="s1156">Well, let’s take a look what happened in the last Democratic convention.</span> <span id="s1157">They’re supposed to go through an amendment or whatever, that they’re condemning anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1158">It didn’t go through.</span> <span id="s1159">Just three weeks ago!</span> <span id="s1160">They’ve been sitting on it - for whatever the reason is!</span> <span id="s1161">Who the hell cares?</span> <span id="s1162">But the fact of the matter is that it didn’t go through, did it?</span> <span id="s1163">Now I don’t care about the politics behind it.</span> <span id="s1164">There is any question that anti-Semitism has no place in our democratic society?</span> <span id="s1165">But here the leaders by themselves, they’re supposed to be our next president, and all other people that we support, the amendment didn’t go through.</span> <span id="s1166">How quickly they forget, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1167">So you got it.</span> <span id="s1168">It’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: It could be explosive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Could be explosive.</span> <span id="s1171">The material is here, because like I say, the people more materialistic oriented.</span> <span id="s1172">And so the values are not there.</span> <span id="s1173">You know, let’s not kidding ourselves.</span> <span id="s1174">When I travel, and I travel a lot, I can sit in a plane and see 65% of the people will pick up the sports.</span> <span id="s1175">They don’t care what is on the front of the page, what happened in Massachusetts, or what happened over here or there.</span> <span id="s1176">It doesn’t hit ‘em in the face.</span> <span id="s1177">And so you ought to understand that the society is much easier to motivate when it comes to this type of a situation.</span> <span id="s1178">Because they’re really not in what is really going on in the world, what really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: It’s easier to manipulate them with propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: I think you got the right word.</span> <span id="s1181">Easy to manipulate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: What is your sense about the future - as a Jew?</span> <span id="s1183">Or do you feel that you’ve already said enough about it?</span> <span id="s1184">Is there anything that you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: It may sound paradox, what I’m saying here, because I’m living here and not in Israel.</span> <span id="s1186">I think our future would be grim already if it wouldn’t have Israel as a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s1187">I feel very strongly about it.</span> <span id="s1188">I think that Israel, over the years - it may now diminish a little bit - put prestige on all Jews around the world, religious and not religious.</span> <span id="s1189">And I think that without Israel we will be much worse off.</span> <span id="s1190">And so we have to do everything possible in our power to have our Jewish state.</span> <span id="s1191">Without it, if we live there or not live there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: My question is, we have this strong ethical tradition which is a part of all of us, it’s part of our teaching, how do you react to the militancy of the younger generation of Israelis, many of whom are saying, “Let’s go after the Arabs.</span> <span id="s1193">Kill them or we’ll be killed.</span> <span id="s1194">.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Well, if we go with the philosophy that we are the chosen people, then this has no place.</span> <span id="s1196">If you go with the philosophy that we as a nation, as any other nation in the world - except with a little bit different background, history - then you will find this in our society, as much as you find prostitutes in Israel.</span> <span id="s1197">I never believed that there can be such a thing as Jewish prostitute.</span> <span id="s1198">I was brought up...I just...just didn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s1199">It just blows my mind!</span> <span id="s1200">So you have to live with the facts that we are a nation, and in our nation you’re going to find all the things that any other nation will find - Jewish or non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: So at this point, being more moral, more ethical than other peoples is not pragmatic in terms of wanting to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1203">You know, I don’t agree with them.</span> <span id="s1204">This is not the philosophy that I have.</span> <span id="s1205">It doesn’t make us better with this type of philosophy, but you’ve got a Rabbi (Meir) Kahane there, in my book a little nuts, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Well isn’t that destructive to what the Israelis want to accomplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: That is destructive.</span> <span id="s1208">I don’t believe in it.</span> <span id="s1209">What I’m saying is that if you’re going to try to justify that, “Look, this is Jews and this shouldn’t happen,” I’m saying to you that you will find in the Jews, a percentage more or less, the same thing as you’re going to find in any society in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1211">So your experience leaves you, I think, with a broader understanding of what human nature is all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Sure I have.</span> <span id="s1213">And the fact of the matter is that they (Kahane’s followers) go to jail, right?</span> <span id="s1214">The fact of the matter is that the Israelis condemn it.</span> <span id="s1215">And if you have a small group of 20 or 30 people, it should not reflect a nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: And you have confidence in the Israeli leadership to deal with these various groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1218">I think we need some changes.</span> <span id="s1219">There’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s1220">I hope when peace will ever come, I think it’s going to be the greatest nation in the world.</span> <span id="s1221">We have the heads and the intelligence and the know-how to deal with a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1222">So I really feel that if we wouldn’t have to spend this much on the military, this country.</span> <span id="s1223">You’re always going to have some disagreement, and 9,000 parties.</span> <span id="s1224">This is the way I think is a healthy situation - this is what democracy is all about it!</span> <span id="s1225">Listen to people’s views.</span> <span id="s1226">And this what you got there!</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: You see the potential for reaching peace through accommodation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Absolutely!</span></p></body></html>
