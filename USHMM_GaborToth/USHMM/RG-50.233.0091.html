Merrick.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Zgierz, Poland.</span> <span id="s6">Spelled Z-g-i-e-r-z.</span> <span id="s7">It’s near Lodz, about four miles from Lodz.</span> <span id="s8">I was born January 8, 1926.</span> <span id="s9">I had my mother and father who were living in the same city as Zgierz.</span> <span id="s10">I had a younger brother, his name was Motl.</span> <span id="s11">He was three younger.</span> <span id="s12">I was attending school in Zgierz when the war broke out September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s13">I think I was 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Can I ask -- let me stop you for just a second and ask you a little bit about your early life; before the war?</span> <span id="s15">And about -- can you tell me some things about the town?</span> <span id="s16">Was it a large town?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s18">Zgierz was a town, excuse me a minute you’re going to edit it later, right?</span> <span id="s19">Is that what it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: No, we won’t edit it.</span> <span id="s21">It’ll be just like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: All right.</span> <span id="s23">The town was, Zgierz, I think it was about, 129,000 people, was about 5,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s24">Was mostly textile, the people were engaged in textile.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Was that area of Poland a big textile area?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes, because Lodz was the biggest textile area in Poland.</span> <span id="s27">Zgierz was only about eleven kilometers away.</span> <span id="s28">This is roughly about five, six miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: When did you start going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I think I started school in 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So you would have been, how old?</span> <span id="s32">Seven or eight years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I think seven years old.</span> <span id="s34">This is when primary school started.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Was it a public or a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: It was a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you also go to like a Hebrew school or a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes, I was going to a Jewish school in the afternoons because the public school was up to, let’s say about one, two o’clock.</span> <span id="s39">After this about once a week, or twice a week we had to go to Hebrew and learn about Hebrew.</span> <span id="s40">We also had one hour of religious school in the public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Oh, so you had one hour of religious training in the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: In public school, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What exactly, do you remember the things that you studied in the Jewish school??</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Basic religion, you know, it was a basic course, about the holiday and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Was it very far from the public school or---?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No, it was in the same class.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Oh, it was in the same class?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: It was in the same school.</span> <span id="s49">We just had I think, all Jewish pupils, boys and girls.</span> <span id="s50">But we had a sprinkling of gentiles, they excused themselves.</span> <span id="s51">So the same thing, it was a Catholic class.</span> <span id="s52">The Catholics had one hour of public school too.</span> <span id="s53">So they excused the Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, like I just mentioned, most of the teachers were Jewish.</span> <span id="s56">A few of them were Poles.</span> <span id="s57">The head of the school, he was a Pole.</span> <span id="s58">As a matter of fact, he had the same last name like I have and he was a Pole.</span> <span id="s59">I just remember one Catholic boy was going to our school, to our class because he was persecuted in the old gentile school because his father was a communist and things like this.</span> <span id="s60">So he couldn’t attend school over there, he came to our school.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you remember like any instances of kids getting beat up because they were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Sure, all the time.</span> <span id="s63">As a matter of fact, it happened to me too.</span> <span id="s64">On my street, there were not many Jews living so when I came home from school or from any other place, I saw a couple of roughnecks in the street, I know they going to be after me, I was waiting for a grown up person who was going to pass by my house or maybe to the same apartment building so I can go with him.</span> <span id="s65">I would be protected, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: This happened often or---?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes, quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Do you remember which street you lived on, the name of the street when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">It’s a long name, I could spell it.</span> <span id="s71">The name of the street is named after a city nearby because it led like--Rockville Pike to Rockville.</span> <span id="s72">The name of the city was Konstatynowska, K-o-n-s-t-a-t-y-n-o-w-s-k-a, no. 15.</span> <span id="s73">I t was a wooden frame house.</span> <span id="s74">There were four families living in the same house.</span> <span id="s75">We were living like on the courtyard.</span> <span id="s76">The European houses have courtyards., I mean apartment buildings have courtyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Tell me, what did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: My father worked, he was---he worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s79">Like I mentioned, there was a textile center.</span> <span id="s80">He was--sometimes he was going on a truck.</span> <span id="s81">They had a truck and they also had horses and carts.</span> <span id="s82">They were going to the nearby city of Lodz and they were picking out raw materials from the factories that came out from the machines.</span> <span id="s83">He worked in a finishing factory.</span> <span id="s84">They brought it back to the factory and they dyed the material and they took out all this floss and they prepared it for the stores -- to be ready to go to the stores and to work.</span> <span id="s85">Here you go in, you buy a ready-made suit.</span> <span id="s86">But in Europe ,especially 50 years ago, you went to a store first and you bought the material.</span> <span id="s87">Then you had to look for a tailor.</span> <span id="s88">So when they finished the material, the material went to the stores.</span> <span id="s89">The people went in and said I need material for a suit.</span> <span id="s90">Man rolled it open, says, how much do you need?</span> <span id="s91">He brought the measurements to the tailor.</span> <span id="s92">The tailor told him how much he’s going to need.</span> <span id="s93">He took the scissors, he cut it off, he took it to the tailor and he made the suit.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: That’s what your father did, getting the finishing of the textiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s96">He bought the material.</span> <span id="s97">He didn’t finish it by himself.</span> <span id="s98">He just collected all the materials from the nearby city.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did he have a buyer or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No, it wasn’t a buyer because he wasn’t buying it.</span> <span id="s101">He was collecting it for the factory like you buy a salesman.</span> <span id="s102">He brings in the material to be finished up.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Your mother, she was a housewife?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s105">In the younger years, she worked but like we were getting older, we were growing up, she took additional work.</span> <span id="s106">She was working with wool in a factory too, spinning wool for the material.</span> <span id="s107">It was a textile center, everybody was working in the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Were there any -- like Jewish or any youth organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes, many.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Were you involved in any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yeah, I was still young.</span> <span id="s112">At that age, I really didn’t know exactly what organizations means.</span> <span id="s113">I was 13 years old when the war broke out but I belonged to a couple of organizations, just to get together to meet people.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: What did you do in these organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: We sing Hebrew songs, talking about Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s116">Everybody was dreaming of going to Palestine one day because Jews were always at the mercy of the Poles.</span> <span id="s117">They always felt like second -class citizens.</span> <span id="s118">In this country we refer like ‘we’.</span> <span id="s119">In Poland you refer ‘they’.</span> <span id="s120">You felt like an outsider, like you were not part of the process and things like that.</span> <span id="s121">So it’s different.</span> <span id="s122">They had a quota, they had a quota in school, they had a quota in the military.</span> <span id="s123">A Jew couldn’t be a high official in the government.</span> <span id="s124">Maybe from the Jewish district, he was elected, a representative, but that’s about--he couldn’t be a high official, appointed.</span> <span id="s125">He couldn’t--they didn’t take any Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Why don’t you tell me a little bit about when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Okay, I remember exactly when the war broke out, September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s128">I remember it was a Friday.</span> <span id="s129">I think my mother went to the market.</span> <span id="s130">Friday was market day, especially with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s131">They went to buy the stuff for the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s132">There wasn’t like a grocery store.</span> <span id="s133">You went to open market and you came back in the morning.</span> <span id="s134">It was eight, nine o’clock; the weather was crisp; everybody was talking about the war.</span> <span id="s135">I looked up the sky and I saw these planes with the top that time because the war hysteria was going already a week or two weeks before mobilization, talk about the Germans and things like this.</span> <span id="s136">On Friday, nothing happened to our city.</span> <span id="s137">The planes flew over in the morning.</span> <span id="s138">They were just like birds up in the sky, the sun was shining.</span> <span id="s139">Saturday, the planes came back again and the Poles were shooting up.</span> <span id="s140">You could see the tracer bullets, you don’t know if you hit them or not.</span> <span id="s141">The planes flew right over, flew higher, nothing reached them.</span> <span id="s142">But Sunday, they flew very low.</span> <span id="s143">They came very low over the city and you could even see the pilot inside, very, very low.</span> <span id="s144">The city was in a panic.</span> <span id="s145">Everybody was going towards Warsaw.</span> <span id="s146">The Poles appealed to the populations, to able- bodied men, to go toward Warsaw.</span> <span id="s147">We’re going make a defense line over there, a stand.</span> <span id="s148">My father left too.</span> <span id="s149">I remember we marched all night, 54 left Zgierz, we left for the city.</span> <span id="s150">We went to a nearby village.</span> <span id="s151">I don’t remember how many miles, maybe ten miles, 15 was a village.</span> <span id="s152">Everybody was just like -- refugees.</span> <span id="s153">We took a few possessions, a little bit of bread.</span> <span id="s154">At night, we got very scared because the Poles opened all the prisons and they let out all the inmates.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t know if they were political inmates or criminal inmates but you see a lot of people, they look like hoodlums with shaved heads.</span> <span id="s156">That night, my father left.</span> <span id="s157">He went toward Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: So all of you left together to go to the next town?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: To the next village.</span> <span id="s160">We went there overnight.</span> <span id="s161">But the next morning, my father left -- he was just -- toward Warsaw -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s162">Because the Poles --.</span> <span id="s163">At that time, everything was disorganized already.</span> <span id="s164">It didn’t take long for the Poles to get disorganized already.</span> <span id="s165">It didn’t take long for the Poles to get disorganized.</span> <span id="s166">They didn’t send you a summons, you have to report.</span> <span id="s167">They just broadcast, by word of mouth that all able bodied men who had served in the Polish army at one time or another had to report towards Warsaw.</span> <span id="s168">They named the city Lovitz or something, we’re going to make there a defense.</span> <span id="s169">Me and my brother and my mother were left alone.</span> <span id="s170">We figured well, we cannot defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s171">We have no clothes, nothing; we just left in a hurry.</span> <span id="s172">We went back towards Zgierz, our city.</span> <span id="s173">On the way, we encountered the Polish army coming back, disorganized, disheveled with horses with wagons, some on foot.</span> <span id="s174">I didn’t see any mechanized unit, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s175">We came back to our home and the neighbors said they were glad to see us back, even though they were Poles.</span> <span id="s176">They gave us milk and bread and things like that.</span> <span id="s177">I wasn’t there maybe one hour or two, I heard shooting.</span> <span id="s178">My neighbor who was a man, he didn’t run away because he owned a farm nearby.</span> <span id="s179">He said the Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s180">He probably got wind of it before.</span> <span id="s181">We were into like a shelter.</span> <span id="s182">I don’t know if it was a shelter or maybe an empty cellar, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s183">We were there for a few hours, we heard shooting, then we came out and the Germans were here.</span> <span id="s184">The next morning, we went outside and we saw strange uniforms, not like the Polish army.</span> <span id="s185">We saw a lot of looting, knocking off the stores, everything was in disarray.</span> <span id="s186">We see whole columns of Germans going towards Warsaw.</span> <span id="s187">They were passing our town because Warsaw was north of where we were living</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Were there any --?</span> <span id="s189">Let’s see, you said that this would have happened the first time you saw the Germans, like Tuesday or Wednesday?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I don’t have any perception of time but it was January the 8th, I mean September the 1st, the war broke out.</span> <span id="s191">I think this was about January 6th.</span> <span id="s192">Now I’m reading the stories where the Germans came into Lodz and I see January 6.</span> <span id="s193">Being we were just about four kilometers four or five away from Lodz, this was about six days or so.</span> <span id="s194">It didn’t take long to come up north.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Were there any -- when the Germans came did they --?</span> <span id="s196">You said, you talked about the looting, the looting of the stores and things like that?</span> <span id="s197">Did they also loot houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s199">I don’t see any houses, mostly I see, I’m saying about Germans looting houses.</span> <span id="s200">The populations looting houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: The Poles also?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I have to correct myself.</span> <span id="s203">The Poles were looting houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: So the Germans weren’t doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I didn’t see any Germans looting houses.</span> <span id="s206">They were looting houses and stores, we’re talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did the Germans impose any restrictions on Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well, okay, I’m going to get to this right now.</span> <span id="s209">I’m at this part.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: I’m sorry, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: So after a day or so, after occupation, my father came back.</span> <span id="s212">He didn’t go to Warsaw, he didn’t go to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: He never made it up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: He never made it up there.</span> <span id="s215">He decided to come back.</span> <span id="s216">He decided to come back so after a couple of days he was home, he decided to go back to the factory where he was.</span> <span id="s217">He went back to the factory.</span> <span id="s218">The factory was not in operation.</span> <span id="s219">They put a German commissar in the factory because it was a Jewish enterprise, was owned by Jews but only Poles were working except my father and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s220">They were the only two people working in the factory.</span> <span id="s221">He was there maybe for a week or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: They were allowed to work as they were before?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, well, the factory wasn’t in production, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s224">They were just sorting things out.</span> <span id="s225">Nobody came to work.</span> <span id="s226">They were just straightening materials out and things like this.</span> <span id="s227">No payroll, nothing.</span> <span id="s228">He just wanted to hold on to it because there was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s229">He went back to the factory.</span> <span id="s230">I don’t think he even got paid for it.</span> <span id="s231">They had a German commissar and the German commissar moved; he was a local German, he moved into the quarters where the former people who worked in the office used to live.</span> <span id="s232">They kicked them out.</span> <span id="s233">After a week or so, they dismissed him because he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s234">He wasn’t allowed to work.</span> <span id="s235">Then one day, I don’t have a perception of time, maybe it was three weeks or four weeks, according to the book that I read now, it didn’t take long, maybe mostly five, six weeks, they said all the Jews have to report to the market square.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: This is the same market where your mom used to shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s238">So we all reported to the market square and we were all Jews.</span> <span id="s239">I remember we debating to take my younger brother with us or not.</span> <span id="s240">I don’t think we took him, we left him with our neighbors, they were Poles.</span> <span id="s241">We went to the market square and maybe we stood there for three, four hours.</span> <span id="s242">Anyway, somebody came out and made an announcement, talking about the Germans if I say somebody.</span> <span id="s243">They gave us three days to leave the city.</span> <span id="s244">A lot of people were living up north towards Warsaw, a lot of people -- we left for Lodz to live, for L-o-d-z because my mother had a sister that was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: So it was just you and your mother and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: And my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Your brother was coming too?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah, we left him with the Poles when we went to the market square but then they let us go.</span> <span id="s249">They gave us three days to leave the city.</span> <span id="s250">So we assembled everything and we left to Lodz.</span> <span id="s251">At that time, we know already they’re going to have a ghetto in Lodz.</span> <span id="s252">This was in September.</span> <span id="s253">It wasn’t before.</span> <span id="s254">The Germans came in in September and maybe we left in October, November, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s255">Wasn’t even snow on the ground yet because we rented a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s256">It was only about 10, 11 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s257">We piled up our few possessions, we took our furniture, we took it into our neighbors, to the gentiles because we figure if the war is going to be over -- everybody was talking about England and France going to join the war, the war’s not going to last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Is that the perception that most people had?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s260">Maybe three, four weeks, five weeks the most.</span> <span id="s261">The British, the war’s going to be over.</span> <span id="s262">We can go back and claim our furniture and our possessions.</span> <span id="s263">We took it in for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s264">We knew there’s going to be a ghetto.</span> <span id="s265">We moved in with my aunt, with a few possessions.</span> <span id="s266">We were there maybe a week or two weeks but my father was working with somebody -- he was in the office.</span> <span id="s267">When I mentioned it that there were two Jews working in the factory, I was talking about two Jews like working people.</span> <span id="s268">But in the office, there were a few more Jewish people working over there.</span> <span id="s269">One of the Jews, he was really from Lodz, he worked at Zgierz and he was commuting because he came with the tramway every morning.</span> <span id="s270">We find out that he has a lot of-- he knew a lot of people, he’s got a lot of pull.</span> <span id="s271">My father went to him and asked him if he can help us out; we need some quarters where to live.</span> <span id="s272">He sure did.</span> <span id="s273">We got that room because apartments were very scarce.</span> <span id="s274">They put in the Jews from the city of Lodz itself, from all the environs.</span> <span id="s275">They put them in a small section and it was the worst section, the most dilapidated section in the city.</span> <span id="s276">They assigned us a Jewish quarter.</span> <span id="s277">We had one room, just one room.</span> <span id="s278">It served as a kitchen and everything, just one room for four people.</span> <span id="s279">Then -- that was in -- yeah, also for the refugees who came from the environs, they opened public kitchens.</span> <span id="s280">This was all in the fall of 1939.</span> <span id="s281">I even remember the next Passover which was the next spring like April now, was still the public kitchens, we eat in the public kitchens because we were refugees.</span> <span id="s282">Then they close the ghetto.</span> <span id="s283">May 1st they close the Lodz ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: In 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Let me ask you, can we go back a little bit?</span> <span id="s287">When you left for Lodz, I know that in the middle of September, the Soviets and the Germans split Poland.</span> <span id="s288">You were on the German side?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I was on the German side.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Was there any -- did you know people who tried to run to the Russian side?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Did your parents ever think about trying to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: My parents were thinking like that.</span> <span id="s294">My father had a younger brother.</span> <span id="s295">He was a shoemaker by trade and he was much younger.</span> <span id="s296">He was unmarried and he went to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s297">We also heard tales that people came back from the Russian side.</span> <span id="s298">My wife, she was living on the Russian side.</span> <span id="s299">We heard that people have no place to live and they slept in synagogues and there were hungers going around.</span> <span id="s300">A lot got caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s301">A lot of people did come back but I guess my parents didn’t have the guts, we didn’t have the nerve and we didn’t have the money.</span> <span id="s302">You had to bribe a lot, it cost money for transportation to go even there too.</span> <span id="s303">We didn’t go but my uncle did go.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Because he was unattached?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: He was unattached, he was single.</span> <span id="s306">We never heard from him, we never heard from again.</span> <span id="s307">I never know what happened, if he vanished, if he survived the war or not.</span> <span id="s308">Now, being as you brought my memory back, my father had a younger brother.</span> <span id="s309">Also he had another brother, he went towards Warsaw.</span> <span id="s310">When they said all able-bodied men had to come and he got killed near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s311">He did join a unit in the fighting and we never heard from him again.</span> <span id="s312">Somebody seen him and he says he got killed.</span> <span id="s313">His widow was living in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What was his name, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I think Schomik, Schomolos, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Your father’s younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yeah, but he was married.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Let me ask you, you talked about the ghetto and you said that it was closed in May 1, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: May 1, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: You said it was in a dilapidated area of the city.</span> <span id="s321">Can you tell me, describe it a little bit, how big it was?</span> <span id="s322">Was it surrounded by a wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s324">They closed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s325">My father got a job because we had to live.</span> <span id="s326">I mean nobody gave anything for nothing.</span> <span id="s327">Like I mentioned, this guy, he worked before, he helped us with the apartment, he also became head of one of the hospitals.</span> <span id="s328">They had three hospitals -- first of all when they closed the ghetto, they had 160,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s329">That’s a lot of people.</span> <span id="s330">The ghetto was composed of two sections.</span> <span id="s331">In other words, through the main street, the tramway was going.</span> <span id="s332">The tramway was going through the ghetto and they had a bridge.</span> <span id="s333">The Jews had to cross the bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Yes, I’ve seen a picture of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: If I want to go from one side of the ghetto to the other side, I couldn’t go directly, I couldn’t cross the road.</span> <span id="s336">They also had a few gates where the horse and buggy traffic went through.</span> <span id="s337">Pedestrians could go through too.</span> <span id="s338">The Germans guards there and they open the gate like five minutes or so.</span> <span id="s339">Let’s say 25 people assembled, 50 people and there were no more traffic coming to the main street because there was barbed wire on both sides; they let the people through.</span> <span id="s340">I’m going to give you, I have the book and a picture.</span> <span id="s341">I’m going to give you a clear picture of what this thing looked like.</span> <span id="s342">I had to go on the other side.</span> <span id="s343">My father got a job in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Which was on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: It was on one side, it was on the main side.</span> <span id="s346">My aunt was living on the other side.</span> <span id="s347">Some of us was commuting, I had friends.</span> <span id="s348">At that time in 1940, it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s349">They still got-- you still couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s350">They were sentries posted shoot to kill; there was barbed wire around day and night and nobody could get in.</span> <span id="s351">One section of the ghetto, the cemetery was adjoining it.</span> <span id="s352">There was a lot of black market going on and you still could buy food but then times were getting bad.</span> <span id="s353">Then the Germans requested people for a settlement; it was getting crowded.</span> <span id="s354">They brought more people in from the surrounding vicinities from smaller towns.</span> <span id="s355">They were liquidating the ghetto and then they were coming into the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s356">As soon as the ghetto got crowded, now I’m reading the books, I know how it was.</span> <span id="s357">At that time they were opening the camp in Kaldum, Humhof, the extermination camp.</span> <span id="s358">They had to feed the camp, the factories.</span> <span id="s359">Ostensibly, they were taking -- they were taking some people out for work too, on road crews, healthy men.</span> <span id="s360">But they were also taking out people who were sick.</span> <span id="s361">They sent to different camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: You were talking about passing from one part of the ghetto to the other.</span> <span id="s363">Did you need a pass to do that or just ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s365">They had a bridge, we didn’t need a -- we just claimed a bridge.</span> <span id="s366">I didn’t go outside the ghetto, we just crossed the bridge.</span> <span id="s367">If I didn’t want to cross to the bridge, I could wait near the gate.</span> <span id="s368">Like I mentioned, when no traffic, after 25, 30 people assembled and people assembled other side; there are two guards.</span> <span id="s369">The German guards now, they open the gates and you were let through, pedestrian traffic basically.</span> <span id="s370">But I think they only had about two or three bridges for crossing, I’m going to show you the picture later on.</span> <span id="s371">I gave a map of the ghetto too.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Was it – can you tell me like approximately what size the ghetto was?</span> <span id="s375">Like maybe four or five square blocks or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No, it was more that that, more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: More than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: It was -- if you want to stop this, I can go get the book, maybe they have a scale there.</span> <span id="s379">Could you stop there for a minute, I’ll be right back.</span> <span id="s380">Was in Lynoska N-l-y and Dolna, D-o-l-n-a.</span> <span id="s381">This is the relationship, this is the city of Lodz.</span> <span id="s382">See here.</span> <span id="s383">This is how the ghetto was in relationship to the city.</span> <span id="s384">Here was the Jewish cemetery, see it?</span> <span id="s385">Now, here is the tramway was going up.</span> <span id="s386">It says Zgierz, it was named.</span> <span id="s387">This is the Zgierz where I was born.</span> <span id="s388">Here was barbed wire, just a tramway which is coming through.</span> <span id="s389">Here is a picture -- I’m going to show you a picture what the bridge looked like.</span> <span id="s390">Here it is, it’s a wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s391">Here the tram is coming, we went on the bridge to one side to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: That’s just so that the Jews, according to the Germans, wouldn’t associate with the Aryan groups?</span> <span id="s393">Is that what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: That’s right, right, right.</span> <span id="s395">This was a wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s396">They had three bridges like that in different sections.</span> <span id="s397">They had the tramway where we went by.</span> <span id="s398">When the tramway came through, the windows were closed.</span> <span id="s399">They know with the doors and the windows were locked.</span> <span id="s400">I mean the Germans locked them in.</span> <span id="s401">It didn’t take long to go through the ghetto, maybe in one or two minutes.</span> <span id="s402">It was very small, they just whizzed by.</span> <span id="s403">Now I’m going to show you the Gypsy camp too.</span> <span id="s404">I have a book.</span> <span id="s405">I remember this.</span> <span id="s406">I remember this guy, a German.</span> <span id="s407">A Gypsy camp red, maybe the________no, it was very -- dying like fish and Rita says English were dying.</span> <span id="s408">Was very few – Take a look, this is excrement they were carrying.</span> <span id="s409">Fifty years ago in Poland the worst section of town.</span> <span id="s410">They had no toilets or flushing water or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: All Jews were made to wear the yellow star too</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s413">Here was the eldest of the Jews, this guy.</span> <span id="s414">Well, you read the books, the Jews were – 160,000 Jews and some of them got___________ and then they brought in some Jews from Germany, from Austria, from Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s415">That’s what the guy looks like.</span> <span id="s416">He was visiting the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s417">I guess they went from one place to another.</span> <span id="s418">Here’s what they do with the settlements.</span> <span id="s419">Are you familiar with all this pictures, aren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I’ve seen some of them, yes.</span> <span id="s421">These are the gates of the ghetto here?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s423">That’s the gate, that’s the gate.</span> <span id="s424">Assembled here and then they let you through.</span> <span id="s425">In some places, they had a bridge.</span> <span id="s426">When they had a bridge, there’s no gate.</span> <span id="s427">There were not many.</span> <span id="s428">Here the sign says that Jews’ living quarters, no entry, thing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Was it relatively -- did people go out of the ghetto illegally sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: People trying to get food and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah, people got killed too there, shot too.</span> <span id="s433">Yeah, I remember, sure they got -- but not many.</span> <span id="s434">The Lodz ghetto wasn’t like the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s435">It was not smuggling going on.</span> <span id="s436">Warsaw was a bigger city and a lot of Jews, not a lot, some Jews were living on the Aryan side but not in the Lodz ghetto because the population was so small.</span> <span id="s437">There’s no way you’re going to run.</span> <span id="s438">There was nobody on the other side waiting for you, to receive you or to guide you or to take you some place and hide you.</span> <span id="s439">You couldn’t go no place.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: I’ve interviewed other people who said that they were more frightened of the Poles than they were of the Germans because they said --.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yeah, the Poles because you have no chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: They said that the Germans only knew from propaganda who was a Jew.</span> <span id="s443">Whereas the Poles had lived with them and knew exactly who they were.</span> <span id="s444">So they were more frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Even the bread lines before they closed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s446">Like if you find out like a Polish baker bread, we went in line, the Poles spotted a Jew, they pointed out to the Germans and throw him out.</span> <span id="s447">They said yes, there’ll going to one Jew less in the line, they’re going to get an extra loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s448">This is why all the concentration camps -- I should correct myself -- the extermination camps were in Polish and the Slavic soil like in the Ukraine, in Russia and Poland.</span> <span id="s449">Because the local population was hostile and they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s450">They couldn’t do this in France and Belgium or Holland because enough of the population would help us, or at least there would be an outcry about it and things like that</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s452">They closed the ghetto in May of ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Nineteen forty, right.</span> <span id="s454">May the 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: What was your father doing?</span> <span id="s456">You said he was working?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: He was working in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: He worked in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: He worked in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Did you work or were you not working?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yeah, I was working too.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Well, I tell you, it’s like that.</span> <span id="s464">Everybody had to work.</span> <span id="s465">I was young like I said when the war broke out, I was thirteen.</span> <span id="s466">When I went into the ghetto, I was fourteen, maybe fourteen and a half.</span> <span id="s467">What can a young boy like me do?</span> <span id="s468">There was no schooling ,nothing.</span> <span id="s469">But I noticed that they had a lot in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s470">Like I said, the ghetto was self- administered.</span> <span id="s471">They had more or less autonomy.</span> <span id="s472">From the beginning, the Germans didn’t mix in, they just outside.</span> <span id="s473">They figured why should a German mix in if the Jews themselves can do the job for them?</span> <span id="s474">I seen a lot of boys.</span> <span id="s475">They were like mailmen.</span> <span id="s476">They were -- not mailmen -- like they were carrying mail from one department to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Like couriers or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yeah, they were highly organized in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s479">They had the statistical offices and they had marriage bureaus.</span> <span id="s480">They had archives, they had three, four hospitals, they had orphanages.</span> <span id="s481">Now, I’m talking from the beginning, I’m talking about 1940.</span> <span id="s482">I told my father if he can find out if I can get a job like this.</span> <span id="s483">He knew somebody and we wrote a letter like a petition.</span> <span id="s484">He gave it to somebody and then I got a response.</span> <span id="s485">I got a response for an interview.</span> <span id="s486">I came to the office and there was a young girl over there and she asked me if I have the strong feet.</span> <span id="s487">I says yes so I got the job.</span> <span id="s488">The job was good.</span> <span id="s489">I don’t remember if I got paid or not but I remember that I got two soups a day.</span> <span id="s490">At that time, you only worked for the food, you didn’t work for pay.</span> <span id="s491">I might have got some money too, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So you were one of the se couriers?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yeah, I was one of the couriers.</span> <span id="s494">I was attached to the post office, the main office.</span> <span id="s495">From the beginning, then I mentioned, from the beginning before the hostilities between Germany and Russia, I’m talking 1940, a lot of Jews in the ghetto were still receiving packages from relatives from the Russian side.</span> <span id="s496">At that time, everything was nice and dandy.</span> <span id="s497">We had a post office, we had packages, everything was functioning normally, like this.</span> <span id="s498">The Germans, at that time, in 1940, beginning of ’41, they didn’t quite decide to exterminate the Jews yet.</span> <span id="s499">They put them in ghettos, they concentrate them in centers but I think the Wannsee started a little bit later on, in 1942.</span> <span id="s500">So that time we still received packages and mail and Jews came from Prague, from Germany.</span> <span id="s501">They had relatives; there were mixed marriages and mixed partners maybe who didn’t come to the ghetto and they sent packages.</span> <span id="s502">It was like a post office, everything was functioning normally, it wasn’t quite bad.</span> <span id="s503">You still could get a lot of stuff on the black market, like food and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Were people, at this point early on, were they apprehensive, were they scared that --?</span> <span id="s505">Obviously the people who left the ghetto or were probably shot, they were frightened by that, did people realize what it was pointing toward?</span> <span id="s506">That maybe they might be exterminated?</span> <span id="s507">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Well, I tell you, I’m going to give this now.</span> <span id="s509">I don’t remember exactly when but it was quite early, maybe 1942, we heard a rumor that the Lodz ghetto was sealed.</span> <span id="s510">Some newspapers were getting through.</span> <span id="s511">You could hear some undergrounds, maybe German newspapers, some were getting through.</span> <span id="s512">Because don’t forget maybe they throwing through the gate, houses adjoining, just like the wall in Berlin.</span> <span id="s513">One side was west, one side was east.</span> <span id="s514">Somehow news filtered through.</span> <span id="s515">Don’t ask me why, I was young, I was fourteen, fifteen years old but I heard early on, maybe 1942, there’s such a thing that the Germans said they’re going in the shower and instead of water, gas comes in.</span> <span id="s516">We heard that but nobody believed but we heard it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Is there anything else that you remember that was striking about the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: From the beginning when somebody died, they had a regular hearse.</span> <span id="s519">They didn’t have a motor hearse like here but they had horses but then the situation got bad.</span> <span id="s520">People were dying from hunger and there were too many of them; they just had flatbeds with horses.</span> <span id="s521">There were too many, they just piled them up.</span> <span id="s522">Like I said, I was like a courier, I was in touch with the post office and everything comes in the mail.</span> <span id="s523">Especially they have people, the people, you suffered more than the local, the people who got settled into ghetto like from Germany, from Prague, from Vienna.</span> <span id="s524">The Jews from the west, they didn’t come from a ghetto, they came straight from their homes.</span> <span id="s525">They took just a few belongings, they came to the ghetto, they put them into a hostile environment.</span> <span id="s526">They had nothing in common with the eastern Jews, with the locals and was wintertime.</span> <span id="s527">There was no heating, no fuels, when you came to the houses, you knock on the door, like you had something, a summons for them to report for a settlement or something, you had to go they were all laying in the beds -- were hunger -- they were dying with hunger, very bad.</span> <span id="s528">Then we heard about the Gypsies, they were building a Gypsy camp, I remember very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: About what time was that when the Gypsies came, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: I don’t remember the exact date but maybe it was in the book here.</span> <span id="s531">But I have no perception of time, don’t forget, it’s been fifty years.</span> <span id="s532">But I remember exactly where the place was and they didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s533">I could see, in other words, they get_________.</span> <span id="s534">The ghetto wasn’t getting much food from the Germans outside.</span> <span id="s535">But the Gypsies were getting the food from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s536">Can you imagine how the situation was?</span> <span id="s537">There was the Germans -- the German criminal police was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s538">They had a building in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s539">They dealt mostly with the Jews were informed by other Jews where was hidden wealth and things like that.</span> <span id="s540">Sometimes it was true and sometimes it was untrue.</span> <span id="s541">They saw them then, they thought maybe -- valuables outside the ghetto, they had to show them where it was, maybe in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s542">They killed them, they tortured them, they couldn’t get anything out of them because the man didn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: What was your mother and your younger brother doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Well, my mother, like later on everybody had to work so she was working in a kitchen, a communal kitchen, peeling potatoes and things like this.</span> <span id="s545">My younger brother, he was three years younger that I was so if I was fourteen, fifteen, he was only twelve and a half, thirteen.</span> <span id="s546">I think he worked in a metal factory.</span> <span id="s547">I don’t know exactly what he was doing but everybody had to be employed.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: They were employed mostly like you said, it was easier to get food that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes, because you get food on your job, that’s it.</span> <span id="s550">Because the rations were not enough.</span> <span id="s551">Like I had two soups a day and maybe he got a soup a day.</span> <span id="s552">Everybody got a meager ration, had a ration card but everybody got a bowl of soup by the place of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: You talked about ration cards.</span> <span id="s554">To what did the ration cards entitle you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Very, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: A piece of bread or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: A piece of bread, maybe two kilograms of potatoes.</span> <span id="s558">That sometimes have to last you for a week and sometimes have to.</span> <span id="s559">Sometimes they have to last you for three, four weeks.</span> <span id="s560">You could see that the food came in the main gate.</span> <span id="s561">They had like an enclave.</span> <span id="s562">They had Germans working, Jews working,_____________ and all the food came into this enclave, they processed it through.</span> <span id="s563">They came in with horses and buggies with Polish drivers.</span> <span id="s564">Then the Jewish drivers took over.</span> <span id="s565">They took it into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s566">They unload the material and they brought the wagon with the horses back.</span> <span id="s567">While they were going from the enclave out to the distribution corners to take it, they had, they were guarded with Jewish police.</span> <span id="s568">They just had armbands, they didn’t have any guns.</span> <span id="s569">They were standing on the planks or going behind the wagon if a potato fell off, they picked it up and put it back in the wagon and things like that.</span> <span id="s570">Potatoes came in and flour came in and beets came and flour came.</span> <span id="s571">Don’t forget, after all they had 160,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s572">The Jews baked their own bread but to work in the bakery was a privilege.</span> <span id="s573">You had to know somebody, because you were allowed to eat in the baker, your bellyful, all you can eat.</span> <span id="s574">If you work in the kitchen, you could eat all you want.</span> <span id="s575">It was a privilege to work in the kitchen or to work in a bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: So people were better off?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Were better off because you had your regular rations plus you ate on the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: You said something earlier about the underground, getting information about these possible things from the underground.</span> <span id="s579">Was there pretty extensive underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: I don’t know underground but I know from the beginning, in 1940, I mean the ghetto was really closed but people had connections.</span> <span id="s581">Maybe they came through tunnels or maybe they came through the wires underneath or maybe Jews, they took out Jews for work from the ghetto every day from the beginning.</span> <span id="s582">They were demolishing houses around the ghetto because the Germans want to build a no-man’s-land around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s583">This was near the Jewish quarter and they figure maybe the Jews have a lot of valuables hidden there.</span> <span id="s584">They just knocking down whole blocks of houses.</span> <span id="s585">Maybe outside, maybe they came in contact with Poles or something like that.</span> <span id="s586">Maybe some news filtered through.</span> <span id="s587">I remembered you went to a barbershop or something, the latest gossip was exchanged there.</span> <span id="s588">Somehow the news filtered through.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: How long were you in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: I was in the ghetto since they closed it off.</span> <span id="s591">I left the ghetto in March 10, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: You were there from 1940 or you were there from 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: The ghetto wasn’t a ghetto then.</span> <span id="s594">There was this section but the ghetto was closed in 1940.</span> <span id="s595">I left the ghetto in 1944 and my parents were still there.</span> <span id="s596">From the beginning I didn’t want to go but they said the Germans need people to work for the settlements.</span> <span id="s597">I was hiding and then they threatened they going to take the ration cards away from my parents --.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: If you didn’t go?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: If I didn’t go so eventually I had to report.</span> <span id="s600">We had to report --.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Had there been deportations before?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh, yes, constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Back in 1942, the Germans put a curfew for one week, nobody could go out or in.</span> <span id="s605">The Germans are, they didn’t left it up to the Jews then.</span> <span id="s606">The Germans themselves, they went to --.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">(End of Side A, Tape 1) They took them to a central place ,a center point.</span> <span id="s608">From there they came in to trucks and now we know what happens.</span> <span id="s609">They took them to the train station, put them on trucks and the Kelna, the extermination was only 35 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s610">They took them right n and the trucks came back right away with curfew.</span> <span id="s611">One day, like I said my father worked in the hospital; the Germans came, they surrounded the hospital, took all the patients out.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Okay so you said that your father worked in a hospital and they came and took some of the patients, or all of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: All of them, all of them.</span> <span id="s614">They surrounded the hospital.</span> <span id="s615">I t was early in the morning, maybe four o’clock in the morning, they took all the patients out.</span> <span id="s616">Then they emptied, on the same day, they emptied all the hospitals, three hospitals.</span> <span id="s617">There was a hospital for the insane, they emptied that.</span> <span id="s618">They emptied orphanages and took all the kids out.</span> <span id="s619">I forgot to mention as my memory comes back, my mother worked in the building, she worked in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s620">After this, once they emptied the orphanage, she had no -- then she start working in the kitchen, got a job in the kitchen, public kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: So they took these people away?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yeah, but nobody knew exactly where they took them.</span> <span id="s623">Then where the hospital was, the Germans made like a factory, a tailor shop or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Did they take them away in trains?</span> <span id="s625">Is that how they deported them, they just marched them out --?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: No, they came by with trucks.</span> <span id="s627">At that time – now reading the books, we know that that was the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units.</span> <span id="s628">At that time, they calling the road commander, they were on wheels on big trucks, the road commanders, they come out and they took them by trucks.</span> <span id="s629">When I mentioned it, the Germans put a curfew for a week, they took in, from block to block, they took in with the wagons.</span> <span id="s630">They took them to an assembly point and then the Germans came and took them with trucks or they marched to the train station.</span> <span id="s631">Also I want to mention that near the cemetery is a section called Marishna near the ghetto, there was a sidetrack, a railroad track.</span> <span id="s632">They took them all to the settlements, went to this station.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: By the cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: By the cemetery, was a big station nearby.</span> <span id="s635">The trains were there and they took them on the flatcars.</span> <span id="s636">That’s where I left, from that station too.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: You said that these things happened often?</span> <span id="s638">That there were deportations all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Constantly, constantly.</span> <span id="s640">Because they were bringing in new people, they were taking out and bringing in new people.</span> <span id="s641">Otherwise the ghetto would be a quarter of a million people.</span> <span id="s642">This way they always emptied it, always empty it.</span> <span id="s643">From the beginning, it was up to the local administration who should go.</span> <span id="s644">Because the Germans really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s645">They said we need 7,000 people for the settlement, we need 900,000, 50 hundred people so if some people came from Germany,, from Austria and they were strangers; they were not even resettled yet, they were just living in a building, they just took them.</span> <span id="s646">They just need people, they just needed numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So they weren’t concerned_______.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Weren’t concerned, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Did you ever hear of anybody who escaped or got away from some of these transports and came back and told what was going on or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s651">I didn’t know any person that did escape but like I mentioned before, we knew in 1942, early on, that the people -- they take out a few from the ghetto and they tell you like you’re going to a shower and they give you soap and a towel.</span> <span id="s652">Instead of water, gas comes out.</span> <span id="s653">Somebody must have escaped, don’t forget I was very young then and your mind didn’t believe.</span> <span id="s654">I was fourteen, fifteen years old but I don’t know who said it, but the news filtered through.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: When you were deported, you had to leave your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: My family was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: It was just you that was deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s659">The Jews --.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s661">I know what I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s662">When people were deported, when people were taken out of the ghetto, were they told where they were going or were they just told that they were going to be resettled in the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: They told them they would settle in the east.</span> <span id="s664">The ghetto, like I said, was quite a large area and they had like a central prison, the Jews.</span> <span id="s665">The people had assembled there, like I said, but some people, they really went for work outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s666">Because they had to go to a commission; they had German doctors and they really needed them to work.</span> <span id="s667">But if they took everybody, whole families, you know they didn’t take these people to work.</span> <span id="s668">They just said you have to be resettled in the east.</span> <span id="s669">Like I said, I was hiding; then one day after maybe a week’s time or so, I had to report.</span> <span id="s670">So I was there for three, four days in the central prison.</span> <span id="s671">I remember my father came the last days towards the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s672">I remember the picture just like vividly.</span> <span id="s673">I remember what he looked like.</span> <span id="s674">In Europe he was wearing boots and I remember his face like --.</span> <span id="s675">So we march, the next morning we march to the train station, we marched, all young people, no adult with us.</span> <span id="s676">Youngsters, I was there maybe sixteen, seventeen already.</span> <span id="s677">They put us in an open cart, put us in one of the good wagons, cattle cars and they closed up.</span> <span id="s678">We were riding for two, three hours.</span> <span id="s679">All of a sudden, they open the door.</span> <span id="s680">There was a truck waiting there and the Germans waiting there.</span> <span id="s681">I don’t remember how many people, maybe 50 people from our wagon, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s682">Maybe 50, maybe 60, I didn’t count them; they took us to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s683">It was in Kielce.</span> <span id="s684">It was in southern Poland.</span> <span id="s685">It’s spelled K-i-e-l-c-e.</span> <span id="s686">I don’t know if you heard of it before.</span> <span id="s687">They took us over there and we asked how -- I seen them loading up our clothes, our baggage.</span> <span id="s688">We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp.</span> <span id="s689">That camp still had Jews already from the surrounding vicinities.</span> <span id="s690">The camp was adjoining a factory.</span> <span id="s691">The factory was called Hasac.</span> <span id="s692">It was a Polish munitions factory before the war or maybe it was just a metal factory, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s693">The Germans converted this to a munitions factory.</span> <span id="s694">Over there, in comparison to the ghetto, was good because I had plenty food, as much as I want.</span> <span id="s695">The only this, you came in contact with the Poles.</span> <span id="s696">You work in the factory besides with the Poles.</span> <span id="s697">So we went to the barracks after finish the work but they went to their homes.</span> <span id="s698">They promised us that they going to give us the clothes, I seen them loading the truck.</span> <span id="s699">We ask them, where is the clothes, we never got the clothes.</span> <span id="s700">I only had what I had on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: What you came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: What I came on.</span> <span id="s703">I don’t know who; I was told later on that the people who run the camp, the Jews, they bartered away our clothes.</span> <span id="s704">This is what I was told, I never seen them.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: The clothes that you’re talking about were clothes that you had brought with you and they made you give up when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yeah, I didn’t have -- that’s right.</span> <span id="s707">I seen them loading the truck but when I got to the camp, I never see anything.</span> <span id="s708">I had an extra sweater, maybe an extra pants, an extra pair shoes.</span> <span id="s709">We were all probably gone for labor work so everybody took a little bit clothes.</span> <span id="s710">They never gave it to us.</span> <span id="s711">This was good clothes because we took nothing but the best.</span> <span id="s712">I could barter this if I had it.</span> <span id="s713">I remember I just had one sweater, some I give it away and the Pole, the next day, brought me a loaf of bread or something like that.</span> <span id="s714">But food was relatively good because the locals, they were locals in the adjoining cities and they probably came with all the clothes.</span> <span id="s715">They were bartering all the time so they didn’t eat in the commune kitchen.</span> <span id="s716">Was always a lot of food.</span> <span id="s717">Then at night, I could go to the Polish kitchen if they had food left over, they gave us if I worked the night shift.</span> <span id="s718">In comparison to the ghetto, as far as food was concerned, was gold.</span> <span id="s719">I was always worried about what happened to my parents, everything seemed unreal.</span> <span id="s720">I got up in the morning, everything strange.</span> <span id="s721">I worked in the factory; I was making bullets.</span> <span id="s722">We put in steel and the machines, if you’re working steel with the machines, had to have oil, constant to the oil.</span> <span id="s723">Like I said, I don’t have any clothes to exchange nothing so_________ got all over me and I developed all blisters.</span> <span id="s724">I had all blisters on my knee, on my feet.</span> <span id="s725">Because I had no apron, just plain clothes and I had nothing to change.</span> <span id="s726">Don’t forget I mentioned that I had left in March, 1944 but then the weather was getting colder.</span> <span id="s727">I went out in the morning to work.</span> <span id="s728">They marched us from the assembling, we had to march to factory.</span> <span id="s729">We didn’t have to march too far, just like from here to the light because the camp was attached to the factory.</span> <span id="s730">But a cold day, it hit my flesh and it was hurting because I had blisters.</span> <span id="s731">When I was in that labor camp in Kielce, I heard about the invasion, the Normandy invasion in June 6.</span> <span id="s732">I heard that.</span> <span id="s733">But that time, I really didn’t know where Normandy was; I just heard that the Americans and the British was there, I don’t have any perception of time; maybe the camp, maybe two, three months.</span> <span id="s734">It was the summer and then one morning, this camp, we were guarded by the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s735">A Ukrainian auxiliary this camp.</span> <span id="s736">You mentioned if somebody escaped from the ghetto and I told you I didn’t know of anybody.</span> <span id="s737">But from the camp, I did heard that they escaped, from the labor camp.</span> <span id="s738">But they caught him and then they brought him back and then they shot him.</span> <span id="s739">It was a different part of the country, they did escape and they brought him back.</span> <span id="s740">This was still in the summertime, after the Normandy invasion.</span> <span id="s741">It was in June, maybe July or maybe August, one morning they lined us all up and they say they have to evacuate because the Russian made the offensive.</span> <span id="s742">They were coming westward so they evacuated us and they put us in open flatcars.</span> <span id="s743">We were riding maybe a day or two and then they let us out in an open field.</span> <span id="s744">They gave us food; the Germans were debating where they should take us.</span> <span id="s745">They didn’t know what to do with us -- all the people from the labor camp.</span> <span id="s746">Was not a big camp, maybe six, seven hundred people.</span> <span id="s747">As I mentioned before, only about 50, 60 people.</span> <span id="s748">They had the whole wagons left over but they dropped them off in different camps.</span> <span id="s749">This camp only attached this car, maybe away to another couple cities, attached like a_________ camp.</span> <span id="s750">They didn’t know where to take us, we said why can’t we go back -- we still in Poland -- we said why can’t you take us back to the Lodz ghetto?</span> <span id="s751">There’s a lot of Jews over there.</span> <span id="s752">One of the guys told us, the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated, dismantled now.</span> <span id="s753">Right now, we in the field, it was still warm, must have been in August.</span> <span id="s754">Now according to the books that I read, that was when the ghetto was being liquidated, in July and August.</span> <span id="s755">After a couple of days, we decided and they took us to a place, Shedbush.</span> <span id="s756">We still in Poland, I find it on the map, wasn’t far away, maybe 25 miles away.</span> <span id="s757">Anyway it was all youngsters and we were digging ditches, anti-tank ditches.</span> <span id="s758">The organization Todd was in charge, T-o-double-d.</span> <span id="s759">It was named after a German, it was a labor battalion or something like that.</span> <span id="s760">We came, in the morning, in the daytime we went to dig the ditches and at night we were sleeping in barns, in farmers’ barns.</span> <span id="s761">But at night, we heard shooting.</span> <span id="s762">In the morning we got up and we ask the German what is all the shooting?</span> <span id="s763">We heard the partisans, they were attacking the German units or something like this in the countryside.</span> <span id="s764">So after we dig the ditches, I don’t know, maybe for a week or so, they took us away to Chintzerhau_____.</span> <span id="s765">The Chintz_______ is a -- I think it’s near Upper Silesia -- it’s a very well known Polish city.</span> <span id="s766">The Polish Madonna -- Chintz_________ is on the Polish-German border not far away in Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s767">The same factory with the same work that I did in Kielce that I did in Chintz________.</span> <span id="s768">Over there, I met my friend.</span> <span id="s769">I met my friend which I still keep up to now; he is in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: His name is -- well he changed his name.</span> <span id="s772">His name is now Herbert Lewis.</span> <span id="s773">He’s got a better recollection than I have.</span> <span id="s774">He remembers more than I do.</span> <span id="s775">Somehow my memory fades but he’s got a very good recollection and I met him.</span> <span id="s776">I remember the day; he was wearing boots.</span> <span id="s777">Over there maybe you worked about maybe for a month or two, was all_________, 1944, remember.</span> <span id="s778">We went in the morning --.</span> <span id="s779">He wasn’t in Kielce with Gara; he was in a different camp.</span> <span id="s780">He was in Scarzilsco.</span> <span id="s781">By then, when the Germans came, they evacuated everybody and every able-bodied men they put in --.</span> <span id="s782">He came in Chintz_________ and I met him.</span> <span id="s783">We were working in the same factory.</span> <span id="s784">I don’t know if we worked there for a month or six weeks.</span> <span id="s785">Anyway, it was still the same year; the Germans came one morning, rounded us up and marched us to the train station.</span> <span id="s786">They put us on cattle cars and I could see that the local population, they were running.</span> <span id="s787">We heard distant shooting.</span> <span id="s788">I don’t know, rumors spread in our ranks that the Russians are entering the city on the other side but it wasn’t true yet.</span> <span id="s789">I could see the Germans were loading the big guns on the trains, the German army.</span> <span id="s790">Anyway they put us on cattle cars.</span> <span id="s791">We were gone for three or four days and we wind up in Germany.</span> <span id="s792">We find out that they took us – we went to Buchenwald in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s793">Over there they opened up, we came to Buchenwald and everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them.</span> <span id="s794">They were discarding the Polish money and the German Reich marks.</span> <span id="s795">After two, three hours, we went to sit in barracks.</span> <span id="s796">They had -- Buchenwald was a big camp, was about 60,000 inmates at that time.</span> <span id="s797">It was established early in 1933.</span> <span id="s798">Right now, I know it was a political camp.</span> <span id="s799">In Buchenwald heather on the ground.</span> <span id="s800">But that time I didn’t realize, I didn’t realize that.</span> <span id="s801">Anyway we registered and all the inmates did all the work.</span> <span id="s802">They ask us where we come from, your mother’s name, your father’s name and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s803">After registration, we went to a big hall.</span> <span id="s804">We had to take all the clothes that we wear and before I left Poland, I mentioned that before I left the ghetto, my mother told me that you have an aunt in Paris which I did have, her sister.</span> <span id="s805">She says you have a cousin in Belgium and she gave me addressed envelopes and things like that and says maybe you don’t know where you’re going.</span> <span id="s806">Maybe you’re going to need it one day.</span> <span id="s807">But when I went to Buchenwald and I had family pictures, my mother, my younger brother, I had to put everything on the table.</span> <span id="s808">All the clothes, everything on the table and I only remember one German.</span> <span id="s809">A black uniformed German came in, we all had to o to commission.</span> <span id="s810">He looked at my legs because like I said, from the dirty oil, I don’t know what I blubbered up in German.</span> <span id="s811">He says, he just looked at me and was thinking, thinking.</span> <span id="s812">He just motioned at a line so I went over there.</span> <span id="s813">We had to go in first to a shower.</span> <span id="s814">I remember we just looking is water coming in or gas coming out.</span> <span id="s815">Water was coming out and then we had to all to go in.</span> <span id="s816">They had a big disinfection tube, was maybe like this room.</span> <span id="s817">Had to jump in, oh I had all scabs over here --- was burning and burning.</span> <span id="s818">Before this, I forgot, after I took all the clothes off and everything, we went to a different room.</span> <span id="s819">The inmates were all, the inmates had clippers.</span> <span id="s820">They clipping the head, clipping hair, clipping hair, all over there.</span> <span id="s821">Then we were all clipped up.</span> <span id="s822">We had to jump into this tub, this disinfect thing.</span> <span id="s823">Oh, it was burning something terrible.</span> <span id="s824">Then we jumped out.</span> <span id="s825">This was January, was already January.</span> <span id="s826">_______knows, January 18, according to the record, I got there, January 18.</span> <span id="s827">We went up from this tube, oh yeah, after we got up from the tube, I remember going up a flight of stairs.</span> <span id="s828">They gave me clothes.</span> <span id="s829">They gave me a pair boots, shoes, no socks.</span> <span id="s830">They gave me pants but no underwear.</span> <span id="s831">They gave me a jacket but no shirt.</span> <span id="s832">I didn’t have the striped jacket, just because, don’t forget, it was January and it was already chaos in all those camps.</span> <span id="s833">They had so many people come from Germany, I didn’t even have a tattoo.</span> <span id="s834">I just had an assigned number.</span> <span id="s835">They gave me all these clothes.</span> <span id="s836">Then we went out to the other end of the barracks where we stand for two, three hours until we assigned a barrack.</span> <span id="s837">Here it’s January, it’s cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: You’re wet?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: You’re wet, you’re unshaved and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s840">Then they assigned us a barrack.</span> <span id="s841">In the barracks, then I lost my friend.</span> <span id="s842">He got assigned a different barracks.</span> <span id="s843">You had to slide in and you had to slide out.</span> <span id="s844">You couldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s845">At night, if you had to go someplace, to the bathroom, you were afraid to go if you leave your place.</span> <span id="s846">Because if you’re placed in, nobody’s going to let you back in.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Oh, you mean, to slide back into the bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: You couldn’t slide in, whatever you had to do, you had to make it on the spot.</span> <span id="s849">There was only straw there, there was no --.</span> <span id="s850">You had no blanket, they don’t give you a blanket, we use straw.</span> <span id="s851">To be exact, they were looking like shelves, like bins.</span> <span id="s852">Like you see the pictures, you slide in and slide out.</span> <span id="s853">I was in this barracks and then later on -- when I was in the barracks, I met my friend.</span> <span id="s854">But first of all, they had kapos in the barracks.</span> <span id="s855">I didn’t know what the word kapo means but I know people came to us and he says you people are newcomers?</span> <span id="s856">I says yes.</span> <span id="s857">I says who is your leader.</span> <span id="s858">We called, one was a Jewish policemen in the labor camp was this.</span> <span id="s859">They want to find out how we are treated .</span> <span id="s860">If we told him; we are treated by our own people, they kill him on the spot.</span> <span id="s861">Because they say we want to do an example, in case they take your people out for labor for a day or two to the city and somebody is going to inform on you, your own people;___________ when he comes back, he’s going to have the same thing.</span> <span id="s862">He says we’re organizing the thing.</span> <span id="s863">I remember one guy, he was the head of the camp.</span> <span id="s864">He came to us and says, don’t say anything bad.</span> <span id="s865">Because we always thought maybe we came from the ghetto from Lodz, they didn’t give us our clothes, we could have lived better.</span> <span id="s866">Buy different food, but I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s867">Maybe somebody else squealed on him, maybe not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s868">I was in that camp and then I met my friend, it was nice.</span> <span id="s869">The first day, when I assigned my rations, I put it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s870">I figure I’m going to eat it later on.</span> <span id="s871">You get one day of rations, a piece of bread and a bowl of soup so I figure I’m going to eat the bread at night.</span> <span id="s872">So at night, I went to eat, the bread was gone.</span> <span id="s873">Somebody slipped it out and I didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s874">I figured out, don’t ask me know but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s875">I remember one thing, I sewed up my pockets.</span> <span id="s876">Don’t ask me where I got the needle and where I got the thread.</span> <span id="s877">Somebody must have had it.</span> <span id="s878">I punched a hole in the jacket through here and I was slitting out to here.</span> <span id="s879">While I was in this barrack, they took out people for work, the kapos.</span> <span id="s880">They had people in the barracks, they had people -- Germans, they had Russians who preceded us to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s881">Some people who came maybe in 1939, in 1940, in 1938, they were in charge of the barracks, they were in charge.</span> <span id="s882">The kapos, they had to go to a special appellplatz, the main camp where they counted them.</span> <span id="s883">We had to go to a different spot too.</span> <span id="s884">Sometimes, we stayed for two, three hours in the snow, don’t forget it was January.</span> <span id="s885">The snowflakes they were falling; he counted us up, then dismissed.</span> <span id="s886">Then dismisses, you went into a cold barrack.</span> <span id="s887">If you had a piece of bread left over in the morning, you ate it.</span> <span id="s888">If not, nothing.</span> <span id="s889">In daytime, in the morning, we heard a whistle blowing.</span> <span id="s890">They took us for work, from the barracks, just to drag wood because you have to remember that Buchenwald was carved out from a forest.</span> <span id="s891">I don’t know if you’re familiar or not.</span> <span id="s892">It’s ten miles away from Weimar.</span> <span id="s893">It’s a lot of birch trees and forest.</span> <span id="s894">Maybe they need the wood, maybe they didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s895">They just make you work.</span> <span id="s896">They don’t let you just stay around idle.</span> <span id="s897">They were taking us out for work every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: You were just cutting wood, is that what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: No, I remember I was dragging wood.</span> <span id="s900">I don’t remember where I was dragging it, maybe putting it in one pile, taking to the other pile, everybody had to work.</span> <span id="s901">Over there -- I was doing this maybe for a month or for two months.</span> <span id="s902">Then all of a sudden, one day, they announce they ---.</span> <span id="s903">Then we heard, like I told you, the kapos had a separate room in the barracks.</span> <span id="s904">Have you ever been to service in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: No.</span> <span id="s907">In the barracks itself, they had a couple rooms, in the barracks carved out for the kapos.</span> <span id="s908">They weren’t exactly mean, they were kapos, they were in charge of the barracks, know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Were the kapos, were they Jewish, or were they --?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, well in this instance they happened to be --.</span> <span id="s911">I knew a couple of them were Russians, two, three Russians.</span> <span id="s912">One of them was German.</span> <span id="s913">Maybe they were ex-prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s914">Or maybe they were just taken to Germany for labor and somehow they wind up in a conservation camp.</span> <span id="s915">I didn’t ask any specific.</span> <span id="s916">I know one was -- a couple were German.</span> <span id="s917">One was a green triangle, means he was a criminal prisoner.</span> <span id="s918">One had a red triangle, means he was a political.</span> <span id="s919">Outside the barracks, they had detached, like a small cottage.</span> <span id="s920">They were only German, kapos.</span> <span id="s921">They were not kapos but I don’t know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s922">They were prisoners, they were dressed nicely, they had red triangles and they were in boots, they were nice.</span> <span id="s923">They didn’t take --they had connections in the camp but they were prisoners, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: So the prisoners were treated differently depending on what kind of prisoner you were?</span> <span id="s925">Like if you were a political prisoner, you were treated better than say a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I don’t know whether they were treated better than --.</span> <span id="s927">But if somebody had to do manual labor, they were in charge of the auto workmen.</span> <span id="s928">If somebody had to drag woods, he didn’t have to drag the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: So there was definitely a differentiation between --?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s931">We have the kapos differently But if he was a_________maybe he wasn’t abused to other prisoners but you had to do it .</span> <span id="s932">But they had to go to the appells too.</span> <span id="s933">So all of a sudden, one day they announce they evacuated Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s934">I heard the kapos talking, they bombed, the Americans are already in Erfut.</span> <span id="s935">Erfut spelled E-e-f-u-t.</span> <span id="s936">You ever heard of the word, Erftut?</span> <span id="s937">It’s not far from Weimar.</span> <span id="s938">Buchenwald was near Weimar, ten miles away.</span> <span id="s939">They would be here soon so they took the Jews.</span> <span id="s940">They’re taking the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Do you remember what time this was?</span> <span id="s942">It was in /45, do you remember the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: That must be in February because it was still cold.</span> <span id="s944">Was a very short span.</span> <span id="s945">I was only three months in Buchenwald so I can go back, was in February.</span> <span id="s946">So they say`, they going to evacuate, they going to take the Jews.</span> <span id="s947">All the Jews have to report.</span> <span id="s948">I knew if they take the Jews, I know what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: They only took the Jews at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: To report.</span> <span id="s951">They were all mixed in this camp, mixed Jews and non-Jews,__________and Frenchmen.</span> <span id="s952">They said all the Jews have to report, evacuated.</span> <span id="s953">So the way they did that, they says, they emptied all the barracks in a big place, in a big square and they says everybody on this side.</span> <span id="s954">Then they have this kapo, lined up, like I said, Russians, Germans, and you had to approach.</span> <span id="s955">If they recognize a Jew, you’re on this side in there.</span> <span id="s956">I passed by, they knew me but they let me through.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: They let you on the political side?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A They let me on the other side .</span> <span id="s959">I didn’t go in the Jewish transport.</span> <span id="s960">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s961">Maybe they didn’t recognize me, I didn’t ask any questions.</span> <span id="s962">He just send me so I didn’t go with the Jewish transport.</span> <span id="s963">Then another day, they did the same thing.</span> <span id="s964">I hid underneath the barracks.</span> <span id="s965">Some kapos came in and they pull us out from underneath the benches.</span> <span id="s966">I remember somebody gave me a kick and my back was hurting maybe for a week or so.</span> <span id="s967">Then I met my friend.</span> <span id="s968">He was hiding too, he was in a different barracks.</span> <span id="s969">Finally they says, everybody has to go.</span> <span id="s970">So everybody has to go, alright.</span> <span id="s971">So we line all up and we went to the main camp to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s972">They kept us there in a big hall.</span> <span id="s973">Don’t ask me what kind, I remember it was a big hall, they kept us overnight and the next day too.</span> <span id="s974">Towards dusk, they says, now we’re going to go to the train station.</span> <span id="s975">They let us out from the big, looked like a factory type building.</span> <span id="s976">I would recognize it now.</span> <span id="s977">Now you have to describe, they had the German SA, youngsters, one side.</span> <span id="s978">They had big bat and we had to this and they were beating you.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Like a gauntlet or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Like a gauntlet right.</span> <span id="s981">I want to say like a gangplank but I don’t want to use the word, a gangplank is like a ramp.</span> <span id="s982">You know like a gangplank.</span> <span id="s983">I don’t remember if I received a blow, if I didn’t receive the blow.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: They just hit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yeah, they had three, four on this on this side; three or four on this side.</span> <span id="s986">Then the other side, they lined us up; they lined us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: They had like clubs, is that what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Clubs, or bats or truncheons.</span> <span id="s989">Maybe they had plain stakes.</span> <span id="s990">Who remembers?</span> <span id="s991">You see all these things lie down, they beating the things, you don’t pay attention what it was.</span> <span id="s992">Who knows what it was, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s993">Anyway after you went through this gauntlet, they lined us up and it was already dusk like I said and we marched to Weimar.</span> <span id="s994">The Germans marched us to Weimar.</span> <span id="s995">I remember they had big dogs on the sides, big German shepherds.</span> <span id="s996">They came to the train station, I think it was really dark.</span> <span id="s997">They put us in open flatcars, was already dark, maybe ten, eleven o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s998">I don’t have any perception of time.</span> <span id="s999">The trains start moving.</span> <span id="s1000">So the trains start moving; we moved overnight and then in the daytime, planes came and shot up, Q” They shot up at the train”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: At the train.</span> <span id="s1002">Somebody asked what is the name of this place?</span> <span id="s1003">I heard them say Zeis.</span> <span id="s1004">I don’t know, someplace in Germany, Zeis, Z-e-i-s.</span> <span id="s1005">I think right now, I’m not so sure but I heard Zeis where they make optical equipment over there.</span> <span id="s1006">You heard of that thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: It says we in Zeis or something like that.</span> <span id="s1009">Maybe where -- then the Germans assembled another locomotive after the planes left and we were riding again.</span> <span id="s1010">Then the planes came and shot up again.</span> <span id="s1011">So they assembled us all in columns I don’t know, maybe 5,000 people.</span> <span id="s1012">Don’t forget they say they empty Buchenwald, not all of them.</span> <span id="s1013">They marched us to Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1014">This is another camp.</span> <span id="s1015">I don’t know how you spell Flossenburg, it’s near Weiden.</span> <span id="s1016">Right now I’m reading all the books.</span> <span id="s1017">I’m interested because I lived this period; I know that right now from history was a criminal camp.</span> <span id="s1018">One of the German, Admiral Kanaris, he was head of the German Upfeur, German intelligence.</span> <span id="s1019">He got hung up over there.</span> <span id="s1020">In the middle of the story or not.</span> <span id="s1021">Over there, was even worse than Buchenwald because we were sleeping --.</span> <span id="s1022">I was with my friend there from New York and we sleeping that camp maybe for a week or so.</span> <span id="s1023">Then they say they evacuated Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1024">Thy marched us out from Flossenburg to the train.</span> <span id="s1025">That was in the morning, maybe eleven o’clock.</span> <span id="s1026">I think it was on a Sunday, I don’t know why I remember Sunday but I have stuck in my head, Sunday.</span> <span id="s1027">I know the sun was shining high and the train station was right outside of the camp and they loading us in open boxcars, listen to that.</span> <span id="s1028">The trains didn’t even start moving yet.</span> <span id="s1029">All of a sudden, I see planes from far away.</span> <span id="s1030">Big planes in the sky and the sun shines on them, I think that was the jet age coming out.</span> <span id="s1031">In a second, they were right over the train -- shot everything up.</span> <span id="s1032">All of a sudden, I heard something hit my face.</span> <span id="s1033">I asked my friend, do I have blood on my face?</span> <span id="s1034">He just looked, he says no.</span> <span id="s1035">But I looked up and I see that we were not moving yet.</span> <span id="s1036">They had a big sign, crossing written down in German, made out of wood.</span> <span id="s1037">A crossing sign, you know, maybe one of the splinters, some bullet too, hit me in the face.</span> <span id="s1038">But nothing was bleeding, it was nothing, something hit me.</span> <span id="s1039">When the planes shot up the train, everybody jumped off the train so I jumped off the train too.</span> <span id="s1040">The Germans were running to the farmhouses, to the nearby houses.</span> <span id="s1041">I run after them too.</span> <span id="s1042">I heard them, run into German, must have been a German house or something, I wasn’t the only one, maybe there were dozens of legs, we run with the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Everybody was running?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: We were running.</span> <span id="s1045">The guard says, I heard him, I understood this much German.</span> <span id="s1046">He says, the Americans must have a base nearby because the plane left already.</span> <span id="s1047">They going to be coming back.</span> <span id="s1048">But then after everything was over, the guards came back.</span> <span id="s1049">We came back to the train too.</span> <span id="s1050">But not everybody went with the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: People ran away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: No, some of them stayed with the -- on the wagons.</span> <span id="s1053">They were going through the packages, the Germans’ knapsacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Stealing the food and stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Just with them open.</span> <span id="s1056">They took out the cigarettes, they took out the food.</span> <span id="s1057">When the Germans came and they saw what’s going on, they lined everybody up.</span> <span id="s1058">They searched everybody.</span> <span id="s1059">They found food on them and cigarettes and lined them up and killed them on the spot.</span> <span id="s1060">After a while, they assembled us all and the train start moving again, whoever was left.</span> <span id="s1061">The ones who was killed, I don’t know if they buried them or left them on the side or took them back to camp.</span> <span id="s1062">The camp was maybe a few miles outside.</span> <span id="s1063">We didn’t even left -----__________.</span> <span id="s1064">We were riding again, maybe for a day or two.</span> <span id="s1065">Planes used to come, the Americans and British were already nearby.</span> <span id="s1066">They didn’t have far to go.</span> <span id="s1067">They were already in France.</span> <span id="s1068">They shooting at the planes.</span> <span id="s1069">The guard says, some of them just flew over and they didn’t come down low so the guard says over there they’re your friends.</span> <span id="s1070">If they come over, you wave to them, so we waved, we had no choice, we waved.</span> <span id="s1071">Some just flew over, they didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1072">Sometimes they came down low.</span> <span id="s1073">When they came down low, the guards run out.</span> <span id="s1074">Some of us were packed in the station.</span> <span id="s1075">When the planes came over, I could see the tracer bullets.</span> <span id="s1076">I could see them just like rains, hard rains you can see them.</span> <span id="s1077">I jumped off the train.</span> <span id="s1078">I hid underneath the wagon where the planks are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Where the tracks are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Where the tracks are.</span> <span id="s1081">I just lay there and I could see the guards, were all on the train.</span> <span id="s1082">After this, after it was all over, we went back.</span> <span id="s1083">I remember it was British planes.</span> <span id="s1084">Why do I know it’s British?</span> <span id="s1085">Because I could see the wheel, the mark with the red.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Like a bull’s eye?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: That’s right, like a bull’s eye.</span> <span id="s1088">They came very low.</span> <span id="s1089">I could see the markings then.</span> <span id="s1090">Then they shot up the locomotive.</span> <span id="s1091">Then we left another day and the same thing happen.</span> <span id="s1092">Here they come again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: So they would come every day to shoot up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Every day, sometimes twice a day.</span> <span id="s1095">I don’t know if you’ve ever been in Bavaria or Germany; they have thick_________tunnels over there, you know__________tunnels.</span> <span id="s1096">As soon as they heard the air drone or something like this, the locomotive detached itself and it went for the nearest tunnel.</span> <span id="s1097">After the ride was over, if the locomotive was intact, it wasn’t shot up, they could use it.</span> <span id="s1098">It came back and they pull off again.</span> <span id="s1099">But if the locomotive didn’t have time, they had to get something else.</span> <span id="s1100">But anyway, they shot up a locomotive the last time and they couldn’t get anybody so a big fat German says, everybody line up.</span> <span id="s1101">Whoever cannot -- we going to march from now on.</span> <span id="s1102">Whoever cannot march doesn’t have to worry, we going to provide transportation.</span> <span id="s1103">I know what transportation means.</span> <span id="s1104">I was the first in line.</span> <span id="s1105">Now I can see how lucky I am because, don’t forget, I was in this labor camp, like I mentioned before the food was relatively good.</span> <span id="s1106">I could barter, the locals, so it was more food left for me.</span> <span id="s1107">I was in the kitchen at night and it was food and the camp was only for about three months so I was in relative good health.</span> <span id="s1108">I was in the first line over there.</span> <span id="s1109">We marched all night, me and my friend from New York.</span> <span id="s1110">Then at night, we wind up near the roadside and we took a little bit leaves and they says you’re going to spend the night over there.</span> <span id="s1111">The next night the same thing.</span> <span id="s1112">But the third night, was raining bad.</span> <span id="s1113">I got soaked all through, all wet.</span> <span id="s1114">Whoever fell out of line, if you read the story about Bataan or Corregidor, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1115">I was ready, my friend was ready, I was ready to go the roadside but my friend who lives in New York, he says, come on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: He wouldn’t let you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: He pulled me, yeah.</span> <span id="s1118">I was tripping over wires because they were shooting.</span> <span id="s1119">The planes were coming down, two, three times a day.</span> <span id="s1120">All the wires were down, it was dark.</span> <span id="s1121">I was ready to give up; he says, he grabs me he says you got to keep ---.</span> <span id="s1122">So towards -- that was at night.</span> <span id="s1123">We were marching all night, all wet, you couldn’t walk, soaked through.</span> <span id="s1124">Towards morning, it was already daybreak, we stopped on a farm and they put us in barns.</span> <span id="s1125">They says you’re going to rest here, the guards.</span> <span id="s1126">All of a sudden, decide to take us all out for punishment because somehow, somebody, they were messing up the barns.</span> <span id="s1127">There were no toilets there.</span> <span id="s1128">They were lining everybody up.</span> <span id="s1129">They going to take us to a march or maybe, who knows.</span> <span id="s1130">The Germans had a tendency.</span> <span id="s1131">If somebody did any infractions, they lined everybody up and they picked people at random.</span> <span id="s1132">They lined them up and they says I’m going to pick every third man, or every tenth man.</span> <span id="s1133">They just pull them out and they just shot them just for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1134">So maybe they tried to do the same thing this time.</span> <span id="s1135">When they were getting ready, everybody lined up, we heard shooting.</span> <span id="s1136">So the German says everybody back inside the barn.</span> <span id="s1137">Then the shooting intensified.</span> <span id="s1138">Like I mentioned, it’s a barn.</span> <span id="s1139">A barn has slits so some of the inmates looked --.</span> <span id="s1140">Before I mention that, for some reason an egg fell down, a chicken egg fell down and my friend was nearby.</span> <span id="s1141">We took the egg and we split it in half, a fresh egg.</span> <span id="s1142">While we were sitting in the barn, like I mentioned before, it was raining all night and the barn is warm near the hay and the straw, our clothes is steaming.</span> <span id="s1143">We heard the shooting and we looked out.</span> <span id="s1144">Some of the inmates says, the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s1145">They saw the stars.</span> <span id="s1146">At that time, we didn’t know the American tanks have stars too.</span> <span id="s1147">We know the Russians have stars.</span> <span id="s1148">Then we notice in the front of the barn the guards taking white handkerchiefs, or white rags or whatever it was white and put on the front of their rifles.</span> <span id="s1149">You know what I am talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: I was one of the last ones to get out of the barn.</span> <span id="s1152">I got out of the barn just like you see in a movie picture.</span> <span id="s1153">Everything burns around you.</span> <span id="s1154">You’re a farmhouse; a farmhouse burns here; a barn burns here.</span> <span id="s1155">All the inmates in the thousands, all running wild.</span> <span id="s1156">All uniforms, all kind of uniforms.</span> <span id="s1157">Don’t forget they evacuated the camp like Buchenwald in the thousands.</span> <span id="s1158">The Germans had the transport too with them.</span> <span id="s1159">They had the carts and the horses and some motor transports.</span> <span id="s1160">All of a sudden you see the inmates they robbing the wagons and all the stuff.</span> <span id="s1161">I went to a wagon too, seeing some German boots.</span> <span id="s1162">I had no shoes, I put on a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s1163">I had no size, just pulled them on.</span> <span id="s1164">Like I mentioned before, don’t forget, I said I sewed up the pockets.</span> <span id="s1165">I go over there and I see a big German woman.</span> <span id="s1166">She has a big country bread all around.</span> <span id="s1167">She cut slices and here the inmates stay and everybody gets a big slice of bread.</span> <span id="s1168">Take a big, line the lines, she gives me a slice of bread too.</span> <span id="s1169">Then I go to the next house and I see raw potatoes outside.</span> <span id="s1170">I take these raw potatoes and I start packing them inside.</span> <span id="s1171">I’m all weighed down, heavy.</span> <span id="s1172">I go the next farmhouse, somebody preceded me already.</span> <span id="s1173">They all Russian inmates, Russian- speaking inmtes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: They ate all the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: They already killed the chicken.</span> <span id="s1176">They already picking the feathers off.</span> <span id="s1177">Somebody very quick, they were right there.</span> <span id="s1178">Maybe they got liberated 15, 20 minutes before, who knows.</span> <span id="s1179">Then we saw tanks rumbling by and they throwing down cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1180">Then we go to a clearing and we saw tanks parked and we go over to somebody.</span> <span id="s1181">Somebody ask what language you speak.</span> <span id="s1182">We said, well we from Poland.</span> <span id="s1183">We find a Polish-American.</span> <span id="s1184">He speaks in broken Polish.</span> <span id="s1185">He goes to the truck and brings the care rations up.</span> <span id="s1186">Now I know they care rations, the cheese and the candy was there.</span> <span id="s1187">Somebody gets us cigarettes and I start to smoke.</span> <span id="s1188">I’m all dizzy.</span> <span id="s1189">So I go to the next village.</span> <span id="s1190">The village not far away, maybe three miles.</span> <span id="s1191">Don’t forget there are thousands of people in the villages.</span> <span id="s1192">I see a German stays outside.</span> <span id="s1193">I says food, essen.</span> <span id="s1194">He says, yah, yah, come inside.</span> <span id="s1195">I thought I’m going to be the only one.</span> <span id="s1196">I think I went with somebody too.</span> <span id="s1197">Somebody was besides me there.</span> <span id="s1198">I go in and the place is full.</span> <span id="s1199">They’re already sleeping on the bed and under the table.</span> <span id="s1200">Here’s coffee.</span> <span id="s1201">I says coffee and he says yah, coffee, coffee, eggs, eggs, milk.</span> <span id="s1202">Anyway I ate eggs and the next day my stomach was sick.</span> <span id="s1203">I’m sick and in the meantime they catching -- don’t forget next day after the war, they bringing Germans back to recognize a guard here and some beaten to death, some all bloodied up.</span> <span id="s1204">They picking German up from the house, inmates all over, in the thousands, Russians, ex-prisoners, they’re stronger than I am.</span> <span id="s1205">I’m young, I’m 16, they’re stronger than I am.</span> <span id="s1206">I’m young, I’m 16, they’re in 30’s, 35.</span> <span id="s1207">They entered the war, they know all about it.</span> <span id="s1208">That was the liberation day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Do you remember what day you were liberated on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1211">It’s going to be this week, this 23rd of April.</span> <span id="s1212">I always thought the 24th and I call my friend in New York.</span> <span id="s1213">He says the 23rd of April.</span> <span id="s1214">As a matter of fact, because the paper I just show you from the tracing bureau, it doesn’t say when I was liberated but it (End of Tape 1)</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I went to Schwandorf and I heard the Jews were assembled, all the ex-prisoners over there.</span> <span id="s1217">They made a____________and the women ex-prisoners, they went nuts on the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1218">I don’t know if I should say it on tape, that’s the first time I saw a black person.</span> <span id="s1219">All of a sudden, I see an American army transport pulls up; I saw the blacks of the transportation department.</span> <span id="s1220">At that time the army thing was still segregated then.</span> <span id="s1221">A guy opens the tailgate and I take a look and I see black hands.</span> <span id="s1222">I just looked -- the first time .</span> <span id="s1223">That’s the first time I’ve seen one, I didn’t see it, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1224">Okay so I was in that home and I didn’t have much clothes.</span> <span id="s1225">Some of them, like I said, some of the ex-inmates were smarter and wiser than I am, some of them went to German homes and who was an ex-Nazi.</span> <span id="s1226">They says, listen, you were a Nazi or you were the buegermeister, give me some clothes, give me that.</span> <span id="s1227">So they came with clothes, with sweaters and jackets.</span> <span id="s1228">I was young, I was 17, 18, I didn’t know what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1229">I want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1230">Don’t forget, this happened in April and I left home in March, the ghetto, about a year I think since I left home.</span> <span id="s1231">I still was homesick, I was thinking about Poland and my brother and my sister.</span> <span id="s1232">At that time, don’t forget the first week, we didn’t know the extent, what happened with Auschwitz and all the sick, Kelman and all this concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1233">I still wanted to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1234">I was in this home.</span> <span id="s1235">All of a sudden, American soldiers came, one or two, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1236">He was a Jewish American soldier.</span> <span id="s1237">He says we are in tents here on the outskirts of the city in Scheondorf.</span> <span id="s1238">We are in camp, we need about three, four volunteers who wants to go to work.</span> <span id="s1239">Like washing pots and pans in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1240">I says, I volunteer to go.</span> <span id="s1241">I went and another couple boys and maybe two, three boys.</span> <span id="s1242">We had a ball, all the oranges we want to eat and had a couple of -- I had an Italian cook, an American cook, Italian.</span> <span id="s1243">________from Chicago, a few Polish words and he made spaghetti and it was good.</span> <span id="s1244">Oh the spaghetti, anything, I didn’t mind to wash the pots and pans.</span> <span id="s1245">All of a sudden, chewing gum and candy; they were living in tents on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s1246">In the evening, they brought us back to that house where we sleeping over there.</span> <span id="s1247">The next morning, he said would you like to come back tomorrow, I says yes.</span> <span id="s1248">The truck came like 8 o’clock, 9 o’clock, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: To pick you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Picks us up, the three or four boys went out to camp.</span> <span id="s1251">This lasted about for three weeks.</span> <span id="s1252">Then, he said well, we have to leave, we have assignments.</span> <span id="s1253">We have to pull down the tent, we’re going to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1254">I remember it was a big tall guy, an American, don’t ask me the name, I forget.</span> <span id="s1255">I don’t know if he was a sergeant or not and he says we’re going to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1256">He said but we going to come back and get you boys.</span> <span id="s1257">I didn’t think anything of it.</span> <span id="s1258">He’s leaving, he’s leaving.</span> <span id="s1259">After maybe two, three weeks, this guy shows up.</span> <span id="s1260">He shows up and he says you want to go to Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s1261">I says sure.</span> <span id="s1262">I had no relatives, nothing attached.</span> <span id="s1263">I didn’t have to pack because I had nothing, maybe I acquired an additional sweater or maybe an additional pair pants, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1264">There’s nothing to speak of, I just took it and he picked us up and went to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1265">In Nuremberg, there were tents too.</span> <span id="s1266">I don’t remember what the name of the engineer or Battalion of Engineering or something like that.</span> <span id="s1267">Then, the same thing, all the food and all the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: You were working for them?</span> <span id="s1269">Doing odd jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Yeah, no, no money, nothing.</span> <span id="s1271">Maybe whatever it is, they gave us clothing, they gave us shoes, army fatigues, army boots, whatever you need – a shirt, underwear, green underwear.</span> <span id="s1272">Then they said, all of a sudden, they had to leave too, after two, three months.</span> <span id="s1273">By that time, I was working over there, I also find out that the size of this was Nuremsbek.</span> <span id="s1274">There is a sizeable Jewish community in Furt.</span> <span id="s1275">Furt, it’s Bavaria too.</span> <span id="s1276">It’s spelled F-u-r-t.</span> <span id="s1277">We took the streetcar from Nuremberg and you went to Furt.</span> <span id="s1278">They had Jewish community there and they were all newcomers and had a home too.</span> <span id="s1279">Just like a house but I was not living in this house.</span> <span id="s1280">I think we all had a tent to ourselves, was handy there.</span> <span id="s1281">At that time came to go too.</span> <span id="s1282">So they said they’re going back to the United States but before they say, they pack for their vacation.</span> <span id="s1283">They going to leave from Marseilles, France.</span> <span id="s1284">So they had two choices.</span> <span id="s1285">We can either leave you in Germany and find you another job with the American army or we can give you back to France.</span> <span id="s1286">At that time France was right after post-war in ’45, they could bring across the border.</span> <span id="s1287">You know in ’45, is everything chaos still.</span> <span id="s1288">He says -- we figure, well if they going to dump us off in France, we’re on our own, don’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s1289">Here I find up, the community of Furt and things like that.</span> <span id="s1290">I felt already a little bond.</span> <span id="s1291">So he says why don’t you find us a job here?</span> <span id="s1292">Next to the where they had the tents, was the American hospital.</span> <span id="s1293">I have letters from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1294">They give letters of recommendation, 381st Evacuation Hospital or something like this.</span> <span id="s1295">We decide to work over there and they give us quarters and they give us food.</span> <span id="s1296">Like I said, we had all the clothes, we had a room.</span> <span id="s1297">Inside, was no tents, already in the hospital, had separate rooms, three, four boys.</span> <span id="s1298">In the morning, we just went to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1299">We were not cooking; they had army cooks.</span> <span id="s1300">You know what we were in charge?</span> <span id="s1301">We were lighting the stoves.</span> <span id="s1302">You remember the field army stoves, are you familiar with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Yeah, I’ve seen those before, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: You pump gas and you clean them and you repair them.</span> <span id="s1305">Over there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1306">I work for the hospital for three, four years.</span> <span id="s1307">I think later on and I got paid for that too --but it’s so long ago.</span> <span id="s1308">I think later on they transfer because they had German civilians working too.</span> <span id="s1309">We went in the German economy.</span> <span id="s1310">Then, like I said, my friend, the one I spend the war with, he found himself a job too.</span> <span id="s1311">He found himself a job in the adjoining city with the American army too.</span> <span id="s1312">He told me he heard -- heard a lot of the people who are liberated, they go to America.</span> <span id="s1313">They have relatives but I didn’t have anybody so nothing to claim.</span> <span id="s1314">Then he told me that if you go to Munich, Congress passed a law, he told me the American government -- I didn’t know the difference between Congress and no Congress that some displaced person they can register with the Joint.</span> <span id="s1315">He went first and he came back, he says yes, you can register.</span> <span id="s1316">I went there too and I registered and I had a very easy time because after the war I worked.</span> <span id="s1317">I had recommendations from the army, had a good police record.</span> <span id="s1318">Then I registered and I was -- oh yes, then I think that I went to be on my own.</span> <span id="s1319">I still worked for the hospital, I worked for a while but I didn’t want to live over there.</span> <span id="s1320">Because in the evening I want to be free.</span> <span id="s1321">I want to be with my own people and I put an ad in the paper.</span> <span id="s1322">I’m looking for a room.</span> <span id="s1323">Rooms are very hard to get in Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1324">But I mentioned, I want to mention that a lot of German Jews came back, German Jews after the war.</span> <span id="s1325">They were liberated or some maybe were never in a camp; they were mixed marriages and maybe the Germans didn’t touch them.</span> <span id="s1326">Anyway I went once to a service in Nuremberg, Jewish service.</span> <span id="s1327">There were a lot of German Jews there who came back from Theresienstadt and things like that.</span> <span id="s1328">I find out that they had very high positions in the post-war government in Germany right after the war.</span> <span id="s1329">I want to live on my own.</span> <span id="s1330">I talked to them and one told me he works in this ministry, the other in the other ministry.</span> <span id="s1331">So I put an ad in the paper, I want to be on my own for a room.</span> <span id="s1332">I got a response like in a post office box.</span> <span id="s1333">I went to look at the room and the room was right near the Palace of Justice, near the military tribunal, where they tried the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1334">As a matter of fact, the building was right across the street, I seen the Soviets on the balcony.</span> <span id="s1335">They were living there too.</span> <span id="s1336">The people who were attached to the Justice, to the Russian delegation.</span> <span id="s1337">Anyway I looked at the room and the lady asked me what I do.</span> <span id="s1338">I told her I am working at the hospital.</span> <span id="s1339">She says yeah?</span> <span id="s1340">I says I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1341">She says oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1342">After the war, everybody had a Jewish relative.</span> <span id="s1343">She says you know what, I registered this room, she says, with the government because I don’t want them to assign me a newcomer from -- an ethnic German from the displaced, from Schlis____ or something like this.</span> <span id="s1344">If you can get it, if somehow you can bring a certificate that you want the room.</span> <span id="s1345">I made contact with this German ministry.</span> <span id="s1346">I tell him, listen I have a room but I need assignment.</span> <span id="s1347">No problem, he gave me an assignment, I was living over there.</span> <span id="s1348">Then my papers came through.</span> <span id="s1349">They call me to the council.</span> <span id="s1350">I had to give the birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1351">I don’t have a birth certificate, if you come from Europe, everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s1352">That was relatively easy, you find people from your hometown.</span> <span id="s1353">They know I’m from Poland so I had this witnesses where I was born, where I’m from and I assembled different papers.</span> <span id="s1354">We get them translated into English.</span> <span id="s1355">I went for the interview.</span> <span id="s1356">Finally I got to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: When did you come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I came August 31, 1949.</span> <span id="s1359">Before I came to America, I was in a camp, in a transit camp.</span> <span id="s1360">N the transit camp, they give you orientation, what to expect in America.</span> <span id="s1361">They gave you a booklet, what you should expect.</span> <span id="s1362">They gave you a booklet in your own language, whatever you read the best.</span> <span id="s1363">I took a book in Polish because I understood this language the best.</span> <span id="s1364">They say, the booklet is from -- it say Washington, D.C. is the seat of the government and New York is a big city and things like that.</span> <span id="s1365">So I read all about it.</span> <span id="s1366">I came on the ship_____________.</span> <span id="s1367">It took us eight days.</span> <span id="s1368">I didn’t get sick on the boat, a lot of people sick around me.</span> <span id="s1369">The boat came to New York harbor like in the evening.</span> <span id="s1370">All of a sudden when you come from Europe, from post-war Europe and we were outside in the harbor, we didn’t go into New York harbor.</span> <span id="s1371">We just stayed there overnight but you could see the cars moving, they looked like, it’s a sight when you come from Europe and you don’t see all the streets and the lights and fire way over --.</span> <span id="s1372">Everything is alive, you see New York City.</span> <span id="s1373">Especially when you see from far away.</span> <span id="s1374">Maybe it was five miles away, out to the harbor.</span> <span id="s1375">We stayed overnight on the boat.</span> <span id="s1376">When the mist start lifting in the morning, I don’t know whether it was August, it got daylight maybe 5 o’clock, maybe 5:30 , I don’t know, it was already mist.</span> <span id="s1377">I went outside.</span> <span id="s1378">We couldn’t sleep already all night, passed the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1379">I read of the Statue of Liberty in the book so I knew the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1380">We passed it and the boat anchored.</span> <span id="s1381">Then immigration came on the board.</span> <span id="s1382">We had papers and everything.</span> <span id="s1383">I became legitimate.</span> <span id="s1384">We didn’t go to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1385">They put a pin on my lapel.</span> <span id="s1386">I came through the Joint distribution.</span> <span id="s1387">Somebody sponsored me but I don’t know who did.</span> <span id="s1388">It came t5he group but somebody must have did it.</span> <span id="s1389">They had different nationalities.</span> <span id="s1390">They always had to have Catholics, they came to Catholic organizations, they had Jewish, they came to a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1391">Maybe they had Quakers through a different organization.</span> <span id="s1392">Anyway, these different organization, my pin, they came towards me.</span> <span id="s1393">I didn’t know this people but they could tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: They approached you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: They approached me.</span> <span id="s1396">They said, yeah.</span> <span id="s1397">Well, I spoke a little bit English but they assign people like to speak in --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Translators, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Translators, they spoke like Yiddish, Americans who spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1400">They took us over there.</span> <span id="s1401">My luggage consisted of an old valise, lock-top and springs, they had no problem.</span> <span id="s1402">He still had to go through customs.</span> <span id="s1403">Now I know they’re customs, they open up and they’re looking.</span> <span id="s1404">They assign you right there.</span> <span id="s1405">You go on the other side and you get doughnuts and coffee.</span> <span id="s1406">Doughnuts and coffee and then I saw a Yiddish-speaking woman comes to me.</span> <span id="s1407">Remember that I had nothing to carry.</span> <span id="s1408">I didn’t need a porter.</span> <span id="s1409">She says you come with me.</span> <span id="s1410">I remember riding escalators.</span> <span id="s1411">It must have been Penn Station or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1412">I remember going to taxi, another taxi, maybe it was.</span> <span id="s1413">I remember riding escalators and taking with the gate.</span> <span id="s1414">There were a lot of people outside the gate0.</span> <span id="s1415">She says, she gives me two tickets and she says, you going to Washington D.C.</span> <span id="s1416">When the gate opens up, there will be a train there.</span> <span id="s1417">When the people go down, she didn’t even wait until the gate opens up, when the people go down, you go down the stairs and you get on the train with the other people and you get off in Washington D.C.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Was there any reason that you went to Washington?</span> <span id="s1419">They just sent you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1421">Right now, I cannot think of any reason because I put in my papers that I worked in the American army in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1422">Maybe they figured there’s a lot of hotels in Washington, D.C., maybe he can find a job in a -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1423">They sent me to Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s1424">They just send me there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1425">I’m going to Washington, D.C. and they gave me three dollars.</span> <span id="s1426">She gave me three dollars, three American dollars and says, you buy lunch on the train.</span> <span id="s1427">She says in Washington, D.C. you wear this pin and somebody is going to approach you.</span> <span id="s1428">Okay, so the gate opens up and everybody goes down.</span> <span id="s1429">The doors slide open and I go inside.</span> <span id="s1430">Everyone sits down and I sit down too.</span> <span id="s1431">Now I’m ready – I says I got to go to Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s1432">They said how about I miss it, but I read Philadelphia in the book.</span> <span id="s1433">They told you about the Liberty Bell – they have all these things written down in the book.</span> <span id="s1434">All of a sudden I spot American Legionnaires and they had Washington, D.C. on Legionnaires’ cups.</span> <span id="s1435">So I thought to myself when they get off, I’m going to get off too.</span> <span id="s1436">I had doughnuts and I had the coffee and I had the three dollars in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1437">I said I’m not going to spend the three dollars to buy lunch because I don’t know when I’m going to get an American dollar next.</span> <span id="s1438">I will not go in and have no_______.</span> <span id="s1439">What I’m going to do, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1440">I didn’t spend the lunch and didn’t buy anything.</span> <span id="s1441">I’m getting off in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s1442">Everybody is getting off the train.</span> <span id="s1443">At that time the train wasn’t yet the jet industry developed.</span> <span id="s1444">The train was already a________, if somebody traveled by train especially in 1949, Union Station was crowded.</span> <span id="s1445">Everybody getting off, I’m getting off.</span> <span id="s1446">I’m getting off waiting the main concourse, the main hall.</span> <span id="s1447">I’m just waiting there.</span> <span id="s1448">I have the valise.</span> <span id="s1449">I have my best clothes from Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1450">I have a suit on and lapel.</span> <span id="s1451">The hall empties and nobody is approaching me.</span> <span id="s1452">Nobody.</span> <span id="s1453">I wait and wait.</span> <span id="s1454">If you wait for somebody and you wait for ten minutes, it sounds like an hour especially when you’re in a strange country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: You don’t know anybody there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Know anybody.</span> <span id="s1457">I walk a little bit around.</span> <span id="s1458">I remember I wrote the book and I wrote about the Travel Aid Society.</span> <span id="s1459">I look in.</span> <span id="s1460">What’s it called, Travel Agent?</span> <span id="s1461">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Travel ,Agency or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: No, not a travel bureau, usually military men go inside too like they help out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: I know what you’re talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: It’s a travel-aid.</span> <span id="s1466">They just do volunteer work for people who are stranded.</span> <span id="s1467">It’s not a regular travel agency where you pay money.</span> <span id="s1468">I says maybe I should go in here and tell them that I’m lost.</span> <span id="s1469">I go by and I look in and I see a sailor sitting there talking to somebody so I hesitated.</span> <span id="s1470">I says no I’m going to wait another five minutes and the concourse is already empty.</span> <span id="s1471">Then all of a sudden I see a couple or women.</span> <span id="s1472">They coming towards me.</span> <span id="s1473">They must have spot me the way I’m dressed.</span> <span id="s1474">They coming towards me and I had to see the boat.</span> <span id="s1475">They had a car, they all volunteers.</span> <span id="s1476">To me they probably wait.</span> <span id="s1477">Maybe they couldn’t find any volunteer, were late.</span> <span id="s1478">We walk out Union Station and the first thing you see is the Capitol.</span> <span id="s1479">I says this is the White House?</span> <span id="s1480">No, they correct me, that is the Capitol.</span> <span id="s1481">It never made any difference to me why is the Capitol so white.</span> <span id="s1482">It all depends on which angle you look at the White House, at the portico, it looks like Capitol too.</span> <span id="s1483">Anyway we got in their car and they took me to 18th Street, near the zoo over there.</span> <span id="s1484">It was a boarding house and they says you going to be here.</span> <span id="s1485">They told me the next day, leave it to the Jewish Social Service Agency.</span> <span id="s1486">They wrote down the address.</span> <span id="s1487">The Jewish Social Service Agency at that time was on Spring Road which is right at 14th Street.</span> <span id="s1488">There was no suburbs then and being I was Columbia Road, right near the zoo which is Adams-Morgan now and Spring Street is not --.</span> <span id="s1489">They gave me the address, I can take the bus.</span> <span id="s1490">Over there, I was ---the lady she had lot a -- the Jewish Social Service paid her money.</span> <span id="s1491">She put newcomers up with food.</span> <span id="s1492">She gave me a room, she had a rooming house.</span> <span id="s1493">She says you’re going to be here until we find out what we going to do with you.</span> <span id="s1494">The next day I went to the Jewish Social Service Agency and I had an interview with a Mr. Pixner.</span> <span id="s1495">I think he just retired from the Jewish Social Service Agency.</span> <span id="s1496">He asked me what I did and the war, where I’m from, relatives, no relatives.</span> <span id="s1497">He gave me $20 in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1498">So I had $3 plus $20; I had $23.</span> <span id="s1499">With $23, they says here’s $20 and you will sightsee.</span> <span id="s1500">They want me to go to the city, transportation because they put me up with food so I didn’t need any food.</span> <span id="s1501">I went back to the house and this lady, she packed my lunch.</span> <span id="s1502">She says, I’m a stranger in the city.</span> <span id="s1503">I was afraid to venture too far out.</span> <span id="s1504">She says well you can go to the zoo.</span> <span id="s1505">The zoo was nearby.</span> <span id="s1506">I could walk over there, Adams-Morgan.</span> <span id="s1507">She gave me the lunch so she says it’s a big zoo.</span> <span id="s1508">Big zoo, I’m afraid I might be lost in the zoo.</span> <span id="s1509">So the first bench I approached I sat down and I ate my lunch up.</span> <span id="s1510">I finished for the day.</span> <span id="s1511">The next day I ventured out and I went to 14th Street.</span> <span id="s1512">That time 14th Street was all white and you could walk.</span> <span id="s1513">It wasn’t like after________ before the riots.</span> <span id="s1514">I looked in different stores.</span> <span id="s1515">I saw a cleaning store and I see somebody reading a Jewish newspaper, I recognized it.</span> <span id="s1516">I says maybe should go inside and ask him if he can find me a job.</span> <span id="s1517">But I hesitated, I didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s1518">The following day, don’t forget, I still had food, I went downtown.</span> <span id="s1519">I think Lafayette Park or some place.</span> <span id="s1520">I just sat down and men were sitting there.</span> <span id="s1521">I struck up a conversation with him.</span> <span id="s1522">He asked me where I’m from and everything.</span> <span id="s1523">I told him where I come from.</span> <span id="s1524">He says he’s an ex-Navy man.</span> <span id="s1525">He was in the Seabees.</span> <span id="s1526">He says he lives on 14th Street with his wife.</span> <span id="s1527">He lives in the Cavalier Apartments on 14th Street.</span> <span id="s1528">I was still living far away like I told you, near the zoo which is all in walking distance.</span> <span id="s1529">He says why don’t you come and I want my wife to meet you.</span> <span id="s1530">Okay, so maybe the next day, I went and met his wife.</span> <span id="s1531">He says you know we have to find you a room where you can stay.</span> <span id="s1532">I told him I don’t like where I stay.</span> <span id="s1533">We could find you a job.</span> <span id="s1534">I think he gave me dinner and he said would you like to -- so he says we find a job first.</span> <span id="s1535">Otherwise you wouldn’t be able to find a room.</span> <span id="s1536">How you going to pay?</span> <span id="s1537">He asked me what I did.</span> <span id="s1538">I says I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1539">I worked for the American army, he kitchens.</span> <span id="s1540">They going to find you a job in People’s Drug Store.</span> <span id="s1541">In the commissary at night.</span> <span id="s1542">Are you familiar with Washington?</span> <span id="s1543">They had counters with food and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1544">He took me to the Personnel and they find a job.</span> <span id="s1545">So I work at night.</span> <span id="s1546">He says well, we got to get you a room.</span> <span id="s1547">I didn’t like my job.</span> <span id="s1548">I didn’t like ay nights sleeping in the daytime, work at night.</span> <span id="s1549">I cannot meet nobody.</span> <span id="s1550">I was working there maybe for a week or for two weeks.</span> <span id="s1551">Then he says now we go into the People’s Drug Stores, 14th and Park Road was a drug store and they have notices, who rents for rooms.</span> <span id="s1552">Inside of a day, he saw a room for rent right around the corner where he lives.</span> <span id="s1553">We went over there and we talked to the man.</span> <span id="s1554">They were refugees too.</span> <span id="s1555">They were German Jewish refugees but they arrived there before the war.</span> <span id="s1556">But they were still refugees.</span> <span id="s1557">He recognized my accent.</span> <span id="s1558">Where you from, from Poland?</span> <span id="s1559">I told him.</span> <span id="s1560">He says where do you work?</span> <span id="s1561">I says I just got a job at People’s overnight.</span> <span id="s1562">I don’t like this job and the work at night.</span> <span id="s1563">He says you know what, he says.</span> <span id="s1564">I got a cousin; he’s got a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1565">Let me call up; if he needs somebody.</span> <span id="s1566">He calls him up and this cousin live around the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1567">He was living Arkansas Avenue, in walking distance too.</span> <span id="s1568">He says I have a young man, he’s from Poland, he works at night.</span> <span id="s1569">Do you think you can use him?</span> <span id="s1570">He says bring him over.</span> <span id="s1571">He says, you work the same evening.</span> <span id="s1572">We walk over the same evening come over, how you doing, like with wine.</span> <span id="s1573">All right, a little bit of wine, Manischievez.</span> <span id="s1574">He says I have a place downtown near Thomas Circle.</span> <span id="s1575">He says come over there.</span> <span id="s1576">If you like it, you take the job.</span> <span id="s1577">If you don’t like it, it’s fine too.</span> <span id="s1578">The next day I go over there.</span> <span id="s1579">It’s a daytime job.</span> <span id="s1580">He says, so you spend a day, what do you have to lose.</span> <span id="s1581">You’re off in the daytime, you work at night.</span> <span id="s1582">I stayed there and I says I like it.</span> <span id="s1583">He paid me a dollar an hour, 40- hour week.</span> <span id="s1584">I took home $36 but I figured I have a room already.</span> <span id="s1585">I paid $40 for my room, nice people, German people, nice and clean.</span> <span id="s1586">I have a room, I’m single so I don’t have to go out for food.</span> <span id="s1587">I have a daytime job.</span> <span id="s1588">I have my friend, a newly acquired friend, Mr. Brown.</span> <span id="s1589">Mr. Brown he was very nice.</span> <span id="s1590">Once in a while Sally went over there and she ate and she says you learn English.</span> <span id="s1591">How do you spoke, transportation.</span> <span id="s1592">Very nice people, interested in them.</span> <span id="s1593">You ask about school.</span> <span id="s1594">.</span> <span id="s1595">I enrolled in Americanization school.</span> <span id="s1596">The Americanization school was then on 18th and Columbia Road on California Street.</span> <span id="s1597">I went to school and then I make all -- people from Poland and some from Lodz and some from different.</span> <span id="s1598">Some from boys, some came to an uncle, some came to an aunt, some came just like me.</span> <span id="s1599">That was in the evening.</span> <span id="s1600">I had to be there seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s1601">I went there seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s1602">I learned about the poems Captain my Captain.</span> <span id="s1603">You recite poems and sing.</span> <span id="s1604">Don’t forget we’re all older people.</span> <span id="s1605">Then I make friends.</span> <span id="s1606">On the weekend I have where to go.</span> <span id="s1607">I have already friends and I have a daytime job.</span> <span id="s1608">I ask them what do you do for a living.</span> <span id="s1609">One worked for an uncle, one worked in a tailor shop, one works here, one is giving a party.</span> <span id="s1610">Then I met my wife because I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1611">I met some guy, he says we’re going to have a party this weekend.</span> <span id="s1612">Could you come along.</span> <span id="s1613">He took me along and my wife, she came to her uncle.</span> <span id="s1614">They were living off -- they had already a nice house.</span> <span id="s1615">Uncle was in business.</span> <span id="s1616">You know who lives in the house?</span> <span id="s1617">Fauntleroy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: The former delegate, well to do.</span> <span id="s1620">.</span> <span id="s1621">I had already friends and then after Americanization School, I enrolled in Central High School and take --.</span> <span id="s1622">Right now, it’s Cardoza, it’s 13th and 15th Streets.</span> <span id="s1623">I took a few courses over there at night.</span> <span id="s1624">Then I had already dates with my wife and had parties and we picnic, the American way.</span> <span id="s1625">We went to beaches and I still had my job.</span> <span id="s1626">Then I had to register for the draft and then I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: I got married January 6, 1952.</span> <span id="s1629">I came in ’49.</span> <span id="s1630">I got married in 1952.</span> <span id="s1631">Listen to that.</span> <span id="s1632">I came back from my honeymoon, I had greetings from Uncle Sam to go to the army.</span> <span id="s1633">I says I just came from -- I don’t want to sound like a________.</span> <span id="s1634">I want to go in the army but I just came from a camp and all of a sudden, I got to go away.</span> <span id="s1635">I’m acquiring a family now with a wife, with relatives.</span> <span id="s1636">I don’t have anybody, now I got to go away.</span> <span id="s1637">All right but I have to go.</span> <span id="s1638">The induction center I had to report on New York Avenue.</span> <span id="s1639">I go down there and the first time I must have been late.</span> <span id="s1640">Because we were living northwest and I didn’t know the bus connections.</span> <span id="s1641">I was late and the bus left me__________.</span> <span id="s1642">The clerk over there, it was a legitimate excuse, I was just late.</span> <span id="s1643">She says well you come back next week.</span> <span id="s1644">She put it down on my paper.</span> <span id="s1645">The next week I was there a little bit earlier.</span> <span id="s1646">I came back next week and we took us down to Alexandria.</span> <span id="s1647">I think it’s Cameron (?)</span> <span id="s1648">Station.</span> <span id="s1649">You’re familiar with it?</span> <span id="s1650">We went through the whole process tests and everything.</span> <span id="s1651">Then we had to go for interview.</span> <span id="s1652">I went for interview.</span> <span id="s1653">The captain calls me in because I couldn’t speak -- broken English and probably didn’t make out too good in my tests.</span> <span id="s1654">I didn’t understand some questions.</span> <span id="s1655">He find out that I was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1656">He says, I liberated Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1657">He says I’m going to give you a postponement for one year until you are a little more familiarized yourself with the country.</span> <span id="s1658">We put you 4F now.</span> <span id="s1659">In one year, they called me back.</span> <span id="s1660">At that time, I was already more organized and they called me back.</span> <span id="s1661">I had to report to Ft. Meade.</span> <span id="s1662">I was drafted, I was two years.</span> <span id="s1663">I came in -- I went in as a private, I came out as a sergeant.</span> <span id="s1664">I took my basic training with the 101st Airborne in Kentucky and then I got assigned to Ft. Bragg, North Carolina which was good for me because I was stationed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Wasn’t too far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Wasn’t too far away and I was in charge of the mess hall because I knew it already the same that you cook in baking school.</span> <span id="s1667">I came out top of the class.</span> <span id="s1668">I have all the best recommendations.</span> <span id="s1669">I show you later on after the interview is finished.</span> <span id="s1670">I let you read about it.</span> <span id="s1671">I came up top of the class.</span> <span id="s1672">They gave me a set of knives and everything.</span> <span id="s1673">Then I got discharged from the service.</span> <span id="s1674">I was looking for a job so I got a job from the Giant maybe for a year or two.</span> <span id="s1675">Then I worked for my wife’s Uncle Ben here, a liquor store.</span> <span id="s1676">Then I went back to the guy, the restaurant who gave me the first job.</span> <span id="s1677">Over there, I met somebody who is a salesman.</span> <span id="s1678">He says I know of a place but you know the work, he tells me and I know who wants to sell it, so maybe you can take me as a partner.</span> <span id="s1679">He says I’m going to draw less than you do because I have a job.</span> <span id="s1680">But I just going to be -- I’m going to pull up the money just like you.</span> <span id="s1681">But you live in the house and I figure that that’s a terrific idea for me.</span> <span id="s1682">He knows the place so I went to look at the place.</span> <span id="s1683">I bought the place and now I’m already 19 years over there.</span> <span id="s1684">I’m going on 20 years.</span> <span id="s1685">It’s a very nice place.</span> <span id="s1686">It’s the United States Secret Service is over there.</span> <span id="s1687">I know everybody over there and I have a good business.</span> <span id="s1688">Now I’m ready to retire and don’t forget, I came to America with $3 I got in New York.</span> <span id="s1689">That’s my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: It’s a very good story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Now I’m going to go upstairs and I’m going to show you the letters of my recommendation, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1693">Can I ask you a question before we stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: I know you said you left your family in the ghetto in Lodz.</span> <span id="s1696">Did you ever find out what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1698">I didn’t find out.</span> <span id="s1699">I want to go back to Poland right after when I mentioned it because I was barely one year over.</span> <span id="s1700">Then I got back to work for the American army and this like this.</span> <span id="s1701">Then the pogroms set in in Poland.</span> <span id="s1702">In Kielce when I was there.</span> <span id="s1703">I heard different stories that the people who came back from the camp, who came back to the hometowns, and the Poles made sarcastic remark.</span> <span id="s1704">So many of you still survive!</span> <span id="s1705">I thought you all dead and things like that.</span> <span id="s1706">Then as things became known, when they liquidated the ghetto, the most of them went to Kelna and then they went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1707">Then I considered, I looked at the picture, my father was already 40 years old.</span> <span id="s1708">He was born in 1900.</span> <span id="s1709">He was 44 years, it’s not old but the Germans done that and you don’t have much food to eat, you look like an old man.</span> <span id="s1710">My mother, one year younger.</span> <span id="s1711">Then I had a younger brother.</span> <span id="s1712">He was at that time, he was born in 1929 so that makes him in 1945, 12, 13, so it’s a very slim chance to survive.</span> <span id="s1713">But I did, I was writing letters to friends because I know I had some friends.</span> <span id="s1714">As a matter of fact, right after the war I came in contact with some people from France.</span> <span id="s1715">They were in the French army but they were touched in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1716">Somehow I got to know them.</span> <span id="s1717">They tried to help but I didn’t get any response.</span> <span id="s1718">I wrote to the French government, to different organizations and -- but then after right now with the Clarks_________affair and -- things like this, I obtained a letter from the Clarks_________and I notice that my aunt was on the transport on the list.</span> <span id="s1719">I have the list upstairs too so it’s a very slim chance to survive.</span> <span id="s1720">I didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s1721">Besides I registered in Jerusalem and I registered in Germany.</span> <span id="s1722">They have all my records from the date of inception.</span> <span id="s1723">I figured if a younger brother is looking for me, he could find me easily so I never knew.</span> <span id="s1724">I wondered many times but --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Did you ever think about going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: I wanted to go to --.</span> <span id="s1727">America was the last thing on my mind because I didn’t think of going to America in the first few couple of years after the war, only America had the strict quota.</span> <span id="s1728">They took in people who were sponsored by somebody who guaranteed the highest, highest, highest.</span> <span id="s1729">But then somehow, I think Truman, they passed a law, Congress passed a law, they got to admit 200 or 250 thousand refugees.</span> <span id="s1730">I wasn’t the first one to believe in it so my friend, he is the first one who entered Munch.</span> <span id="s1731">But he brought me back to prove that he registered, he didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s1732">I went after that too.</span> <span id="s1733">From that time, I knew I’m going to have it easy because I didn’t engage in smuggling, black markets.</span> <span id="s1734">I had a legitimate job and all the recommendations so I know if that’s the date, I be coming here.</span> <span id="s1735">That’s my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: Okay, I think we’re done if you want to say anything else before --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: I was just saying --.</span> <span id="s1738">What I want to say, now things are differently.</span> <span id="s1739">At that time in 1944, if people could help one another but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1740">A lot of people kept silent.</span> <span id="s1741">I wouldn’t condemn the whole race or the whole nation but a lot of people could’ve survived.</span> <span id="s1742">The populations was very hostile in Europe, in Eastern Europe especially.</span> <span id="s1743">In Western Europe it was a different story but in Eastern Europe, the Jews were always second-class citizens.</span> <span id="s1744">Even right now, I’m reading the stories like after cleaning of the Warsaw ghetto, they brought the people from Auschwitz to clean the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1745">When the Poles made a revolt, they freed some of the inmates.</span> <span id="s1746">The revolt didn’t last long but just for six weeks or so.</span> <span id="s1747">They freed some of the inmates, they cleaning the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1748">They said we want to free Poland with our Jews.</span> <span id="s1749">Some of them got killed after the war so that what it is.</span> <span id="s1750">That’s man inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s1751">Right now if you see something wrong, you stand up and get to be counted.</span> <span id="s1752">That’s exactly what it means -- man’s inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s1753">It’s an old poem, I don’t know if you read.</span> <span id="s1754">It’s not a poem, it was in the paper.</span> <span id="s1755">A German priest writes.</span> <span id="s1756">He says when Hitler came into power in 1933, he said, they start persecuting the Jews.</span> <span id="s1757">He says, I wasn’t a Jew, I didn’t spoke up.</span> <span id="s1758">Then they take the
