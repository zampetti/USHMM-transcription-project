could afford, so she</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And that was a private institute, sir?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes, it was in Primishlana.</span> <span id="s112">It's Emryten (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So this is hercan you tell us what this is, which card this is?</span> <span id="s114">This is her gymnasium picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s116">The name was ___________________+ Polish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s117">The name of Kveenyaveega (ph) in Primishlana.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: And those teachers whichI don't know nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Do you know how old she was when this was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I cannot tell if this is my brother, because I couldn't understand the whole '33, '43.</span> <span id="s122">She was _________________+, but in '43, Jews couldn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s123">I couldn't go to school, so this must be somewhere in between, or maybe somethingten year or something.</span> <span id="s124">But this was done by Vadel, a Jewish photographer.</span> <span id="s125">I knew him.</span> <span id="s126">I remember him very well because I used to go to him with my mother, my parents' pictures.</span> <span id="s127">But he was killed in '41 so I couldn't understand how this was madethis was probably made between '33 andbut notmaybe in '43.</span> <span id="s128">This is hard for me to describe.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: And I don'tI think this was a religious teacher.</span> <span id="s131">He was Jewish.</span> <span id="s132">Yes, he was feshtop (ph); he's not alive.</span> <span id="s133">It seems to me that this gentleman is also Jewish.</span> <span id="s134">Is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: So there were both Jewish and nonJewish students at the gymnasium as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s137">Oh my God, and more Jewish.</span> <span id="s138">She, too, had the Jewishtwo other Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s139">I don't know.</span> <span id="s140">They got a picture from a Gentile and probably theythis is how they indicate the Jews who are not alive probably.</span> <span id="s141">__________________+ not been someduring the gymnasium was notthis couldn't be of them.</span> <span id="s142">Or maybe when this was done, maybe there's just indication of Jews.</span> <span id="s143">So for me, it's, you know I asked my mother and she told meof course, she knewshe knew the other one.</span> <span id="s144">She knew all the Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Your mother knew all the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: She know them.</span> <span id="s147">She know the teacher.</span> <span id="s148">She knew alsoI remember she mentioned this: Her name was Flusay Lord (ph).</span> <span id="s149">She was a Polish woman, a Polish teacher.</span> <span id="s150">But thisbut one thing is for sure, that Vadel couldn't have made this in '43.</span> <span id="s151">Was killed.</span> <span id="s152">And my sister, if this was in '43, she wouldn't be.</span> <span id="s153">Not only, all the Jews wouldn't beso it must be done, the picture, but the occasion, they couldn't come, in the sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: And being in Russia after the warfirst of all, we gotabout two, three years after we were liberated and then we find somebody who made a picture of my sister based on this one.</span> <span id="s156">So we have it at home, a big picture.</span> <span id="s157">That's what I can't tell about this picture and what her story.</span> <span id="s158">She was a very bright girl.</span> <span id="s159">She spoke English, she was planning to study medicine somewhere overseasoverseas in the West, not in Poland.</span> <span id="s160">She had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s161">She helped us a lot from '41 to '43.</span> <span id="s162">She worked; life was very difficult.</span> <span id="s163">And after our ghetto was liquidated, we were hiding immediately, and she was walking in the city, in the camp.</span> <span id="s164">It was not a concentration camp per se but it was a working camp.</span> <span id="s165">Jews and Poles work there.</span> <span id="s166">You ask me why she was there?</span> <span id="s167">She could have escaped with us but she was trying to retrieve some things for us to be able to continue hiding and living, etcetera.</span> <span id="s168">Me and my mother and my sister were hiding at that time inby Poles, outside the city, and I used to go to visit her.</span> <span id="s169">I remember I visited her twice or three times.</span> <span id="s170">She couldn't visit us.</span> <span id="s171">And when I visit her the next time, I don'tthe third or the fourth one, she wasn't there, and I remember I was surrounded by Polish girls and Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s172">And I said, "Where is Esther?"</span> <span id="s173">And they saidthey didn't tell me that she was taken away, of course, and killed probably immediately there.</span> <span id="s174">Said, "She went to another place to work."</span> <span id="s175">And then I asked, "Can I come tomorrow and see her?"</span> <span id="s176">And I remember they told me, "No.</span> <span id="s177">If she come back, she'll come and visit you."</span> <span id="s178">Of course, in retrospect this was a preludium.</span> <span id="s179">It was painful for them, and I was beginning to cry _________________+ something.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Do you remember when the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Oh, yes, remember September 1, '39.</span> <span id="s182">Yeah, how well I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And how did other people react?</span> <span id="s184">How did your parents react when the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: They act scaredthey were scared, normally.</span> <span id="s186">We knew thatwe didn't knowI couldn't understand that they would know what the Germans are doing; they would probably run to Russia, from one part.</span> <span id="s187">For the other part, we were welloff, and the Russians sent many to Siberia.</span> <span id="s188">My auntmy aunt from Gleenyana (ph) they were owners of a factory so they wereher husband was arrested, and my aunt and her daughter Arella was taken to Siberia.</span> <span id="s189">Unfortunately for them, they didn't survive thereno, unfortunately for them, they survived but they came back in '41.</span> <span id="s190">They came back because my parents, many people around spoke about them very highly, positively, and they wrote to the Russian government that they were not for Bourgeois who exploit other people.</span> <span id="s191">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s192">In '41, they letshe came back, and her husband came out from the jail because of intervention.</span> <span id="s193">Couldn't understand how thisand of course he very, very happy when she came back but in two months laterin two or three months later the GermanRussian war started.</span> <span id="s194">If they would stay there, maybe they would survive.</span> <span id="s195">Maybe he wouldher husband, Mosha, would have gone to see them, but those ____________________+ she came back, unfortunately, for them.</span> <span id="s196">In '41, my father was killed, and my two uncles were killed, in November.</span> <span id="s197">The Germans came to our town in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What was it like when they occupied the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: It was very, very scary.</span> <span id="s200">The Jews were taken immediately, in a very arrogant way.</span> <span id="s201">On November 5th, my father and my two uncles were orderedthey got ordered November the 4th by the Jewish Judenrat, the Jewishcame to the same place where my sister went.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Which is the gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: The gymnasium, yes.</span> <span id="s204">Of course, at that time there was not anythere wasn't a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s205">I don't remember wasI don't remember what.</span> <span id="s206">And from there, the same day, they took them to the woods and shot them.</span> <span id="s207">So this was the connection with the same place.</span> <span id="s208">Oh, of course I remember very well the Judenrat asked everybody to bring whatever they possessed, gold things, in order to buy them out.</span> <span id="s209">We were very naive, naive people, thought everything would ___________________+ but around 3:00 o'clock I was trying to run to see them butthe streets were empty and around 3:00, 4:00 o'clock they began to take groups to the woods in our city, Snutwasfada (ph).</span> <span id="s210">It was a very beautiful place.</span> <span id="s211">But the shooting was already going on, we can hear this.</span> <span id="s212">And around 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock, women were cryingRoma, Romasand I remember that I wasI gottold my parents and my sister that I'm going toto the place of them, and I went.</span> <span id="s213">As a child, I well remember I hadI had the Aryan look at that time, and two or three people more went to this place.</span> <span id="s214">It was already night.</span> <span id="s215">The Ukrainian police and the Germansmostly Ukrainianwere they went to the city to eat, to drink, and then they came back to bury them.</span> <span id="s216">Not they, probably, it was But then I went to the woodsI went close to the place where they were shot, and I remember that there were some cries of probably many people who were wounded, and I was scared and I run back, and I told the story to my parents, to other people there.</span> <span id="s217">So other peoplesomemostly, of course, Romathey followed, they run to this place, and they didn't came back.</span> <span id="s218">They were shot also there.</span> <span id="s219">So I was lucky that didn'tso this was but prior to this my father ________________+.</span> <span id="s220">My uncles were taken to jobs to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: They were taken by the</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: By the Germans, the Ukraines, or by the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s223">They told them where to come and to do work.</span> <span id="s224">This was prior to November 5th.</span> <span id="s225">Then they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How else do you remember your life changing before November, when they went into your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Oh, changed immediately.</span> <span id="s228">First of all, I didn't went to school.</span> <span id="s229">My Polish friends, still some of them werewe met, we play.</span> <span id="s230">Also, they went to school, so we have to meet after school.</span> <span id="s231">We didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s232">Soand we lived in the same building untilI don't rememberand then our building was converted to a Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s233">Was a big one.</span> <span id="s234">So they moved to another place, of course, in a crowded apartment, not like our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So you were evicted from your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">And then in '42 wasI remember aktion, one of theand my grandmother was with us, and

to my uncles, to my father; they were not ready to life at that time, in '41, in '42.</span> <span id="s266">Then in '42 there was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s267">So they moved from this place to the

and they shoot them __________________+.</span> <span id="s277">I remember I saw some picturesnot pictures I saw, but then the dead were removed and this happened.</span> <span id="s278">This house

id="s281">First, we moved to athere was no ghetto immediately but when the ghetto was created, I moved from other house to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: And where in the ghetto did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: In the ghetto we lived in another house, we crowded with other people.</span> <span id="s284">There were aktions sometimes so we run away.</span> <span id="s285">And the final life in the ghetto was until May the 20th.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: What was</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: There were rumors that there will be aktions, but there were very often the rumors.</span> <span id="s288">We had connections before, but from the ghetto we couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s289">But we had some hiding place where we lived, and when the aktion started I remember very well there was a kitchen.</span> <span id="s290">You opened the kitchen and through the kitchen we went down to a something, and from there I rememberI didn't participate in it but they built something inside, lower, and thank for thissorrywe survived because the Germans discovered the entry but nothing was there.</span> <span id="s291">Now they discovered but nothing was there, we were below.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">I remember it was crowded because all the people from the building went down.</span> <span id="s293">And I remember my sister, we are sitting there, a wall of us on some soft things, and this wasand at night we went out, at nighttime, after being there one dayone day or two days, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s294">I don't

Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s332">And I remember one evening they told us to get out, because there were big gardens there, and sit there, because they were afraid, because the Ukraine police, they're looking for Jews there.</span> <span id="s333">Not immediately, because they had a lot of work to do in the city, but after being there probably a month, at night they took us out and they suggest us to go into the corncorn, a lot of corn there, just sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: In the cornfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes, in the cornfield, me and my mother

people were walking there, Poles.</span> <span id="s349">And my sister's intention was to go over there, which she did, to go over there to find some hiding place for us, because we were lost and, you knowshe know where we were but she couldn't go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: How old was she at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: I think probably 20, I don't know.</span></p>

Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: In another place.</span> <span id="s360">Not in the city, already; outside the city with my mother.</span> <span id="s361">And sheI think once she came to visit at night also, once or twice.</span> <span id="s362">And that's it.</span> <span id="s363">I used to visit her a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What was she working on at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What type of labor did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s368">They did some agricultural labor.</span> <span id="s369">Some of them went to work to the ghetto, to do some work in the ghetto, cleaning.</span> <span id="s370">And the assumption was to helpshe told us she would go back to the ghetto so maybe she would be able to take some things from our place where we lived.</span> <span id="s371">We had some valuable things.</span> <span id="s372">Not many, because the most the Germans took or the Jewish Judenrat took them.</span> <span id="s373">And my father and my uncles there, we thought that they would be able to take them out because of theto buy them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: But she went back to see if there was anything after?</span> <span id="s375">Had it been liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No.</span> <span

to our place, she told me, and I believed her.</span> <span id="s381">I met her a few times.</span> <span id="s382">And then one thing, when she wentshe scratched her leg somewhere, unfortunately, and she had to bend it, and the Ukrainian police and the German came and they look they saw, and because of that, they took her out.</span> <span id="s383">I assume, but they maybe thought that she couldn't work, that she couldn't be so productive or maybemaybe theythey took a few people and they shot them.</span> <span id="s384">That's how my sister's end was.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: That's how she died?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Yes.</span> <span id="s387">But at that time we were already at Sokolik's place, in Borochoff (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Can you spell Sokolik?</span> <span id="s389">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Spell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I spell it in Latin and then inin

told ________, Sorry, I've tried this, what can we do?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">And then my mother was a very energetic woman and she immediately, I remember, she said, All right, we have to live, I have toI hopeI belief you will survive, we will survive, and this and that, and she was verywe lived at Sokllyk's place three months.</span> <span id="s403">After three months, they were

id="s606">Shooting.</span> <span id="s607">The Germans, I don'tUkrainian.</span> <span id="s608">I run away, disorganized.</span> <span id="s609">My mother was different places.</span> <span id="s610">My sister Ida was with Bronyah (ph).</span> <span id="s611">I was by myself somewhere.</span> <span id="s612">I was so close to the German, I remember he passed by, he almosthe could have hit me.</span> <span id="s613">And I always think about this.</span> <span id="s614">I said for my</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Where were you hiding when he</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: In the woods, yes.</span> <span id="s617">This was all the aktion in the woods, he passed by.</span> <span id="s618">I remember he was breathing, and maybe he saw me and maybe he doesn't want toI don't know.</span> <span id="s619">I don't, but this was I remember.</span> <span id="s620">And my sister Ida was with Bronyah.</span> <span id="s621">They catch some people there but fortunately, nobody from our family.</span> <span id="s622">And in the evening whenever they came back, and of course we were happy to see Bronyah, my mother's cousin, and they're all alive, and Ida, and I was soit happened a few times, where aktionas, as they call this in German, aktionyou know this.</span> <span id="s623">In Polish, oblava; in Russianthey're looking for people, for Jews.</span> <span id="s624">Jew hunting is another word.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Who else were you in hiding with, aside from your cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: There was some other family from Primishlana.</span> <span id="s627">I don't know them; I don't remember them.</span> <span id="s628">But we were hiding not together.</span> <span id="s629">Everybody separate because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s630">Sometimes you come to each other.</span> <span id="s631">There was another question of food, because in the summertime immediately they told us what we can find in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Who told you what you can find in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Oh, my cousins.</span> <span id="s634">Said, Well, goyou find __________in the woods or you have to go outside, steal potatoes, because outside the woods.</span> <span id="s635">And of course they went to the village because they friends and some Poles, Ukraine but mostly Poles gave us food, gave food to Mommie, but you cannot goMommie went once a week, twiceonce a week, maybe once in two weeks, I don't remember, because it was dangerous to go to the woodsto the villages.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And did your mom receive food from former neighbors or friends, or did she she know everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No, sheyes, she got food from _____________, who used to work for us.</span> <span id="s638">Because we had a lot of land there and they were working the land; they had a nice life on this.</span> <span id="s639">So Mommie know some of them, she went to them, but she was afraid to go towe never know.</span> <span id="s640">See, their way of thinking was proably maybe we'll take over their lands, I don't know.</span> <span id="s641">So sometimes, you know, very often my mother went to and bought some food, some potatoes, some bread.</span> <span id="s642">I remember one very unpleasant thing where my mother went out and she came back.</span> <span id="s643">The dogsshe was bitten by dogs, her legs veryblood and this and this.</span> <span id="s644">But she brought food.</span> <span id="s645">And this was happen during the wintertime, and when we came was already probably September, October, so we began to accommodate for the winter.</span> <span id="s646">Mushrooms we used toin the woods so lots of _______________+.</span> <span id="s647">I learned to distinguish good mushrooms and bad.</span> <span id="s648">We make the fire.</span> <span id="s649">The mushrooms were very tasty; I will never forget the taste.</span> <span id="s650">The hunger properly combined with taste with something to eat would create a good taste.</span> <span id="s651">And this was the life in the woods.</span> <span id="s652">Always afraid, always half naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: How did you stay warm in the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: In the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Inside and _________________+ got no water.</span> <span id="s657">It wasn't warm.</span> <span id="s658">In the winter we had somenot a cooking facility but something was made to warm with.</span> <span id="s659">And also, we had in the winter someI don't know how it was combined.</span> <span id="s660">My cousins did it.</span> <span id="s661">So we can ___________some water.</span> <span id="s662">Not cook with, somethingit's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s663">We are hungry always, and there theand lice.</span> <span id="s664">And the lice.</span> <span id="s665">How we survived, I don't know.</span> <span id="s666">But then spring came so it was little bit better, easier.</span> <span id="s667">I remember the winter, I went out some break some food because we were making some fire inside this almost _______________ just like _________________+ I went out and came back.</span> <span id="s668">The same day my mother did, my sister did the same, Ida, was a small child butthe three of us were lying, covering each other, and this took a few months untiluntil June or July of '44, and the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So you had been in the woods</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Almost a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s673">All time in the woods that couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s674">And we had also my aunt who came back from Siberia, I told you, she was with us also in the woods, a separate place, and with her husband.</span> <span id="s675">I don't know why and what happened.</span> <span id="s676">She became sick or her daughter became sick and they find their hiding place in the village.</span> <span id="s677">Some Poles, they took them in, also the Bairns (ph).</span> <span id="s678">And shortly after they took them in the Ukrainian policeor I don't know who came, this what we were tolddiscovered him, took them out and beat him to death, evendidn't kill them.</span> <span id="s679">They beat her, her daughter, and her husband to death.</span> <span id="s680">They werethen they were buried somewhere not far from the place in the woods, I don't know where.</span> <span id="s681">We were looking with my cousins to find out their places.</span> <span id="s682">Yes, and during hiding in the woods there, we had other events with my cousinMenda was his name.</span> <span id="s683">I don't rememberfor water, because we didn't have water.</span> <span id="s684">And suddenly we heard something: Rachela, Rachela.</span> <span id="s685">I will never forget his name.</span> <span id="s686">Somebody was calling Rachela.</span> <span id="s687">It's a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s688">And I don't know it was a __________________ as a child but I was already and adult, everything that life make you.</span> <span id="s689">And I said to Menda, Who is Rachela?</span> <span id="s690">He said, No, this is not Rachela, it'sproperthey called the Jewish name, they want to come out some Jews, and we run back to our place.</span> <span id="s691">And later the next day we find out that there was a Jew hunting on the other part of the wood and they catched a few Jews.</span> <span id="s692">This is their tactic: When they catch the Jew they always say, Callcall other Jews, if they found a name.</span> <span id="s693">But this was forthey didn't callshe didn't call our name or other names.</span> <span id="s694">She called Rachela, I remember.</span> <span id="s695">And Rachela was not among the hiding places with us.</span> <span id="s696">So they went away and didn't come out.</span> <span id="s697">But were many such things which</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Did youdid you constantly hear the German and/or Ukrainian forces around you?</span> <span id="s699">Was it almosthow often did you hear them in the woods while you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Oh, very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: And was it bothdid you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: No.</span> <span id="s703">No, if I saw them it wouldn't be the best thing for me.</span> <span id="s704">Yes, from a distanceI remember I wasthe woods ______________ and sometimes I want to go out.</span> <span id="s705">Not from the woods per se, but as I'm ____________ in the woods, just to walk liketo run.</span> <span id="s706">And I knowand then we notice somebody is coming, two or three people, far away, so we run away.</span> <span id="s707">I don't know.</span> <span id="s708">They were probably maybe looking for Jews or maybe for ______________.</span> <span id="s709">Yes, very be often, uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: How did you find water?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: There were places where we go after rains, dirty water.</span> <span id="s712">This was very often because there was no water close to this place ________________+.</span> <span id="s713">In the wintertime we used the snow and melt the snow, it was no problem, but in the summertime water was a big problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: What was it like when the Soviet soldiers liberated you in 19in July of '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">It waswe had shooting all over.</span> <span id="s716">We had rumors thatartillary shooting from far distance and we thoughtwe always hoped that it will come closer, because the Russians made a big move insomewhere in January, and they stopped in March not far from us, about 200 kilometer.</span> <span id="s717">It was another German line of defense.</span> <span id="s718">This was in ___________________+ And if they would go a little bit further, my aunt would be alive, other people would be alive, but it didn't happen this way.</span> <span id="s719">And when the Russians came in we didn't know, realize, shooting _________________+.</span> <span id="s720">Then some Poles then contact with us, came and said, The Russians are here, we can go out.</span> <span id="s721">We were afraid, we didn't trust, we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Who told you, which Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: A Pole from the village, he know that we there, somebody that used to come to us.</span> <span id="s724">And we came to the village and we saw Russian soldiers around you, and in _____________ we want to be closer to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s725">You know, my mother saidI cannot remember it was a Jewish officer.</span> <span id="s726">She thought they were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: In the Russian Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s729">Not only one, but a few of them.</span> <span id="s730">And of course they were very good to us and they asked us aboutand immediately they feed us because we are hungry and we are dirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: How did you know how did your mom know they were Jewish, the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: They know that we are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: They knew that</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes, we told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: And then I remember a Jewish doctor came, and there were many Jewishthere were a few of them there.</span> <span id="s737">Of course they immediatelyI don't remember.</span> <span id="s738">They settled us and two peasants not far from the place where they were stationed, and they thought the peasants would take care of us.</span> <span id="s739">Of course, we were not afraid, we thought that the Russian are here, that the Germans are not here, but we were deeply mistaken.</span> <span id="s740">The Ukrainian killed many Jews, those who survived, immediately, for differentfor certain reasons.</span> <span id="s741">First, for maybe they ________________________+ but we survived, and we were surrounded by the Russians.</span> <span id="s742">They gave us some clothing, they gave us food, they told us not to eat a lot, I remember; they gave us very small portions because some of us died immediately after one or two days: It was swollenI was swollen likemy mother was swollen.</span> <span id="s743">So the doctors immediately, I remember, they checked us, they told usand they gave us a bath, some _________ clothes and there were awe were a few days there.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">And we ask, How about Primishlana, can we go back to our city?</span> <span id="s745">They said, No, the city is still not taking baths.</span> <span id="s746">A few days later</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Did youdid you speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yes, we spoke Russian but because we lived under the Russians two years already.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: ________________.</span> <span id="s751">And they told us that the city will be taken by us, _________________ to the city, you cannotthey told me, Don't walk to the city.</span> <span id="s752">That was good advice, otherwise we would be killed.</span> <span id="s753">But because the village which we were was consist of twos parts; one part was typical Polish and the other part was Polish, mostly Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s754">The Ukrainian part was very dangerous; we didn't go there.</span> <span id="s755">But after the war, many Poles were killed by Ukrainian there.</span> <span id="s756">During the Germans, and even after the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s757">So when the Soviet army began to move further, so they took us to the city in their car.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: The</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: They took you.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: The officer, the soldiers.</span> <span id="s762">And of course they was fightingwas fighting but I don't know, fighting wasn'tfor me, I was happy to see the fighting.</span> <span id="s763">I remember when the Russians were close, I went in the woods with another guy, boy like me.</span> <span id="s764">We saw the fighting, shooting.</span> <span id="s765">Fortunately, the Germans didn't went to our woods when they were beaten, but the Russians did.</span> <span id="s766">So they went in different streets, in different ways, the Germans.</span> <span id="s767">But we saw them from the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: I just want to make sure we're on the same track.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Disorganize everything.</span> <span id="s770">_________________+</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: We're good.</span> <span id="s772">No, that's okay.</span> <span id="s773">Do you remember</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Do you think questions could be more precise?</span> <span id="s775">It would be easier for</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: When you were in thewhen you were in the woods and you were in hiding, do youhow aware were you of the war and what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Just by rumor sometimes, from the Poles, and my mother went to the village.</span> <span id="s778">Nothing, no, nothing.</span> <span id="s779">We became very more when the front was closing.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: When the Russians were coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s782">And was artillary shooting, flyingthis wasotherwise, nothing.</span> <span id="s783">Like wild animals withoutbecause we always hoping that the Russians would break this, this, we listen to their shooting from _______________ you know, the ________ house.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Do you remember seeingyou said you saw some of the shooting when you wereafter you were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No.</span> <span id="s786">Me shootingthe war between the Russians and Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah, sure, mutual shooting, yes.</span> <span id="s789">The artillary shooting we can see from theit was a pleasant vision.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: And then after you were</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: When we came to the city, because we had to have house, couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s792">I remember I saw the dead bodies and myand they were shooting in the hospital.</span> <span id="s793">Blood on thebut there were many empty apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And this was the hospital that you saw with all the dead bodies, which housethat was your</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: This was our house.</span> <span id="s796">But we didn't go back there to live, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: But you saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: This was there.</span> <span id="s799">And the Ukrainians were already living there, people were living.</span> <span id="s800">It didn't bother them.</span> <span id="s801">So we find an apartment in anothera Jewish apartment in another place and begin to look around.</span> <span id="s802">I remember the city wasthe ghetto was destroyed.</span> <span id="s803">The city was completely different, the people weremany people from the villages came to the city so never knew them.</span> <span id="s804">A few of my school friends, neighbor friends with whom I used to play, they find the life good.</span> <span id="s805">And then immediately the city calls for ______________not to take care of us but we didn't have any papers, nothing.</span> <span id="s806">We couldwent to neighbors' places to find something, pictures, nothing.</span> <span id="s807">This picture was given to me later to us.</span> <span id="s808">We didn't have documents so we have to establish birth certificates, who we are, what we are, school.</span> <span id="s809">And I rememberoh, yes, when I was in the wood, I remember my mother taught me _______________ I can write and read, but I didn't have what to read.</span> <span id="s810">But math a little bit, soand of course I missed four years, three years of school.</span> <span id="s811">So I came backso they gave us tests.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: This isthis is after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Liberation, yes, after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: After liberation</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: In Primishana, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: And before you reentered school would you sayhow manywho did you know else that had survived?</span> <span id="s817">You said some of your school mates.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: No, not many survived.</span> <span id="s819">I know we met, like I told you, my aunt, thosesome other people, another Jewish __________.</span> <span id="s820">About 20 people there in the city, I would say.</span> <span id="s821">Not families per se.</span> <span id="s822">A family consists of one person, two persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">We were the only one family which survived three people of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s826">Oh, and another family from the village, from the same village, survived probably five, six people, which probably they survived from the Booth (ph) family.</span> <span id="s827">But from the city some people came, began coming back from Russia, one, two people.</span> <span id="s828">No, no, the city consists probably at that time from 20, 30 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: And so then youyou movedwhere did you and your mother and sister go exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: We got apartment.</span> <span id="s831">My mother began to work immediately somewhere, I don't remember where, because she has to make it to live for _______.</span> <span id="s832">Some neighbors gave us something.</span> <span id="s833">Nobody gave us back any clothing becauseI don't remember.</span> <span id="s834">But we got some clothing from people, otherwisewe couldn't buy, we didn't have money for what to buy it.</span> <span id="s835">And I remember I was very eager to start school, to see ______________+.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">And there was a Jewish teacher in '41, Leekman (ph).</span> <span id="s837">He wroteso he survived the war.</span> <span id="s838">He was teaching me after the war immediately, because he gave me some privatenot private _____________________+.</span> <span id="s839">He said, Rubin, you have to go to one or two classes higher; you will make it.</span> <span id="s840">And I don't remember which grade he put me in, fourth or third, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s841">School was difficult.</span> <span id="s842">I was very often hungry in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: What did you do for food?</span> <span id="s844">Your mother was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yes, Mother cooked.</span> <span id="s846">__________________+ But still, other people, I remember they came to school with sandwiches that ____________________+.</span> <span id="s847">I didn't have this.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: So, were there Jews and nonJews again?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Your school had both Jewish and nonJewish students again?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: No.</span> <span id="s852">Most nonJewish</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Or there weren't many left.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Jewish students were me, my sister, one other.</span> <span id="s855">I would say seven, eight Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: And how were you treated by the nonJewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Not so friendly.</span> <span id="s858">Not soyou see, they saw what had been done to Jews so everything came out from this.</span> <span id="s859">Of course, I played with them, played soccer, but they don't invited us to their homes, nothing.</span> <span id="s860">In the beginning.</span> <span id="s861">Later, two, three years later when we growwhen the senior class, a little bit closer, but you felt some coolness.</span> <span id="s862">Because the biggest mistake was that we didn't left immediately for Poland.</span> <span id="s863">And now I will tell you why.</span> <span id="s864">When the Russians liberated us we became soI thought I'm a human being, I thought I'm a normal person.</span> <span id="s865">Some of our people, even my aunt, she left forrun away because her sons were taken to the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s866">And those who had people in the age you could be taken to the Army, they run away to Poland.</span> <span id="s867">This was officiallylegally, we have to apply for permit to go to Poland, which my mother did.</span> <span id="s868">I remember she filled out some papers.</span> <span id="s869">And the post office wasn't working so well but I don'tand we were told that we should send this to Schworchoff (ph).</span> <span id="s870">We send it, to get the permit to return to Poland.</span> <span id="s871">Because at that time we knew already that this would be a Russian Ukraine and Poland would be Poland.</span> <span id="s872">Of course, we feel more comfortable in Poland.</span> <span id="s873">But we never got the reply, never.</span> <span id="s874">But my mother could have tried to go without some papers, which wasshe was scared probably.</span> <span id="s875">And then some rumors came that in Poland, their pogroms, which was through, and so my mother called up, said, Herethere are no pogroms here because the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s876">And this was whenbut then we went to school and I don't knowwe were happy with the minimum that we have.</span> <span id="s877">But if we would go to Polandfirst of all, life in Poland for Jews was much better.</span> <span id="s878">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s879">And from Poland, as we learned later, we could be trying to go to Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, to Israel, because Russia was close.</span> <span id="s880">Poland wasand besides, the Poles closed their eyes when Jews left also from Poland.</span> <span id="s881">My aunt, with her two sons, left for Poland in order for them to avoid the Army.</span> <span id="s882">In Poland, they were _____________________________+ because they were of draft age.</span> <span id="s883">So they left for Czechoslovakia, and from there to Germany.</span> <span id="s884">I don't know
