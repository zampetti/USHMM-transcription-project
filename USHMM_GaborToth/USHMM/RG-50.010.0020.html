id="s56">A: I suppose it took us 2-3 hours.</span> <span id="s57">We just took a tour.</span> <span id="s58">It was already liberated when I particularly got there.</span> <span id="s59">They just took us on a tour of the camp, and we saw the bodies and where they burned them -- the gas chambers and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Can you describe first what your reaction was at the moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Another day’s work.</span> <span id="s62">It was about the only thing I could tell you at the time.</span> <span id="s63">I was only 19 years old and I didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s64">I think I felt worse about it 30 years later than I did at the time because at the time we were hardened.</span> <span id="s65">We expected to see anything, which we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: How did others react?</span> <span id="s67">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s68">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: What did the prisoners do when they saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: They just hollered "Amis, Amis, Amis."</span> <span id="s71">They were so happy to see us that they couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s72">And I was explaining to him last night the size of their barracks, the quarters where they lived in.</span> <span id="s73">There may be 10 people in bunks up the wall and they were all as skinny as these pictures you see over here.</span> <span id="s74">There wasn't anyone who had any flesh on him and there were all with their heads shaved.</span> <span id="s75">It was a terrible scene, I'll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Their nationality...were they political prisoners?</span> <span id="s77">And the approximate number in the camp at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: There were no Americans there, and I don't know any of the background of any of them.</span> <span id="s79">I couldn't speak any German.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Were you able to

id="s84">A: No, I couldn't tell you if they were male or female.</span> <span id="s85">The majority of the ones that I saw were all young.</span> <span id="s86">The younger people.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Children?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No.</span> <span id="s89">I would say there was no children.</span> <span id="s90">They were mostly from teenagers on up to about 30 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: What type of a camp was it?</span> <span id="s92">Was it a labor camp or was it an extermination camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Extermination camp, I think.</span> <span id="s94">I think they screened them all there.</span> <span id="s95">I don't know what the ones that were left were doing but there were quite a few of them left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: But there were extermination facilities as far as gas chambers, ovens?</span> <span id="s97">A: Oh, yes, sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">JEFF HALLETT: Did you go through the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, I didn't go through them at the time.</span> <span id="s100">But I did go through there when I took a trip back four years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What was the nature of your contact with the inmates?</span> <span id="s102">Do you recall any kinds of conversations that you may have had?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No.</span> <span id="s104">I talked to none.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Were there any specific incidents that come to mind?</span> <span id="s106">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s107">Not that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Do you know or remember what kind of aid was extended to the inmates on your arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: That I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s110">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: You did mention that the inmates gathered around you shouting "Amis."</span> <span id="s112">Was there any panic at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">JEFF HALLETT: Were there any guards left when you were there?</span> <span id="s115">Any SS?</span> <span id="s116">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: No German personnel of any kind?</span> <span id="s118">A: Not living.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">JEFF HALLETT: He did see SS that had been killed.</span> <span id="s120">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you find any records of any kind, any German records?</span> <span id="s122">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">JEFF HALLETT: You did not witness any violent incidents between the guards and the prisoners or American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No.</span> <span id="s125">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">JEFF HALLETT: Were there any German civilians around?</span> <span id="s127">Any in the vicinity of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Not that I recall, no.</span> <span id="s129">This camp was fenced in.</span> <span id="s130">They couldn't see what was going on.</span> <span id="s131">The only thing the civilians could do was smell the debris that came out of there.</span> <span id="s132">I think the civilians knew what was going on, but what were they going to do about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you have any contacts with members of the armed forces of any other allied nation at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Where did your unit head for after having passed through Dachau?</span> <span id="s136">A: We headed on down toward Salzburg, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you have any post-liberation duties after the war in a DP 1 camp, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: When were you discharged and sent back to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: April 13, 1946.</span> <span id="s141">Q: And between 1945 and 1946 where did you spend your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: In Occupation in Austria, in a little town by the name of Hallein, just outside of Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: What were your duties there?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: At the time, I had a bad shoulder and I did mostly nothing other than just to stay there.</span> <span id="s145">The company guarded prisoners and they were cutting wood and stuff, but I never did pull any duty.</span> <span id="s146">There was a prison camp there but I don’t think I ever saw the camp or pulled any duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Were any trials taking place of the SS personnel or of Nazi leadership of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JEFF HALLETT: Tell me.</span> <span id="s150">Did your experiences in the concentration camp affect the way you looked at the German civilians or looked at Germans in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s152">No.</span> <span id="s153">I felt the civilians weren't responsible any more than we're responsible for what goes on in this country today.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">JEFF HALLETT: Who was responsible in your eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: The SS and Hitler.</span> <span id="s156">Hitler was [unintelligible]...of course he had a lot of people back of him.</span> <span id="s157">Everybody thought it was great at the time when he took over there.</span> <span id="s158">They didn't know what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">JEFF HALLETT: Did you draw a distinction between the SS and the rest of the</span></p> <p><span id="s160">1Displaced Persons German Army and the German population?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s162">They were a bunch of bloodthirsty soldiers is the only way I would put it.</span> <span id="s163">JEFF HALLETT: Did you have any encounters with SS units when in battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I'm sure I did but I didn't know it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Do you currently have any kind of artifacts, documents, letters, photographs of any nature of that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: The only thing I have is a watch and a few German marks.</span> <span id="s167">They’re the only things I have at all that I brought back.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Is there anything that you would like to add of a personal nature, any kind of observation or commentary?</span> <span id="s169">Your own thoughts on the matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Not that I can think of.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">JEFF HALLETT: I have a few more questions if I might add them.</span> <span id="s172">Did the military establishment help you to cope with the experience in any way?</span> <span id="s173">Was there any counseling offered or did the chaplain play any particular role in explaining?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No.</span> <span id="s175">I mean we were soldiers.</span> <span id="s176">We just took it [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s177">It didn't bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">JEFF HALLETT: This experience did not stand out in your entire war time experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yes it did.</span> <span id="s180">But, as I say, when I got out of the service, I put it all behind me and I mean I know a lot of guys who wound up in the nut house.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JEFF HALLETT: As a result of the whole war.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: As a result of the war, right.</span> <span id="s183">[Unintelligible] JEFF HALLETT: Did you tell anyone about the camp when you came back?</span> <span id="s184">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s185">[Unintelligible] I didn't even talk to my wife about it.</span> <span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">JEFF HALLETT: You hadn't told your wife</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No, the only time she ever hears about it is at these reunions and things.</span> <span id="s189">I only talk about it with somebody who was there with me, who knows something about it, because the majority of people would say “Oh, he's bragging” or “He don't know what he's talking about” and I just got disgusted.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">JEFF HALLETT: Do you think there's anything people can learn from this?</span> <span id="s191">A: There’s definitely a lot people could learn from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">JEFF HALLETT: As far as teaching it in school or in religious classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes, I think it should be taught in schools and religious classes.</span> <span id="s194">It would be a great help to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">JEFF HALLETT: Has this experience changed your political views?</span> <span id="s196">A: No, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">JEFF HALLETT: Has it affected your attitude about the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam war, the Cambodian pogroms that have gone on?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: That's hard to answer.</span> <span id="s199">I don't approve of a lot of the things that are going on today.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Did you have occasion to watch the recent program on the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s201">A: No, I didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s202">I would have liked to have seen it.</span> <span id="s203">JEFF HALLETT: Do you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s205">Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">JEFF HALLETT: What would your reaction be if one of your children said they wanted to become a Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I'd feel pretty bad, I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s208">I have one boy, 25, and a daughter, 24, and I think they are more intelligent than that.</span> <span id="s209">But it burns me up to see these guys riding around in this county on motorcycles with Nazi helmets and Nazi tattoos all over them.</span> <span id="s210">I just don't understand what their reasoning is for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">JEFF HALLETT: Do you see the entire Holocaust, especially your experience in Dachau, as primarily a persecution directed against Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I couldn't say they were Jews.</span> <span id="s213">I had no way of telling.</span> <span id="s214">I mean you can't look at a person and tell what nationality he is and that's about all I did was look.</span> <span id="s215">Just went through the camp at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did this experience in any way change your attitude toward Jewish people or to present-day politics in the Middle East?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JEFF HALLETT: That's all I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Mr. Cogar, thank you very much for the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Maybe some of the other guys will come in and talk to you.</span> <span id="s221">[Interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s222">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: ...the establishment or put down the Army for their role in Vietnam.</span> <span id="s224">We have here living testimony of the role that American soldiers have played and young people have to learn that this is the primary role of the American GIA: Right or wrong, they had to do it and I don't think it was right but I almost had to go back during the Korean situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: I think we have to re-learn the young people of this country as to the positive role played by the Army and not just the image that they have tried to portray.</span> <span id="s226">We have to counter that kind of an image and that's why we think a lot of this testimony is important for the learning process.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: I don't understand the majority of the young people nowadays anyway.</span> <span id="s228">What do you want me to do?</span> <span id="s229">Sign this right here?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Just put your name and your signature.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">JEFF HALLETT: If you just state your name and address, please.</span> <span id="s232">.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Daniel H Cogar.</span> <span id="s234">5618 31st Avenue, North St. Petersburg, Florida.</span> <span id="s235">Born
