id="s2">PS: I'm interviewing Dr. Julius Eingorn for the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College.</span> <span id="s3">The date is January 2nd, 1989.</span> <span id="s4">[tape off then on] Dr. Eingorn, can you please tell me where in Europe and in what unit you were serving before you arrived at the site of a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">JE: Well I was with the 89th Infantry Division, excuse me, 79th Infantry Division [chuckles] 79th Infantry Division, called the Rolling W, Third Army.</span> <span id="s6">And we had entered Germany some time in January of 1945, in Spiker [possibly Speyer, GA] and we had variously gone to many different places.</span> <span id="s7">In fact, the month of March we must have made 18 different overnights in various places.</span> <span id="s8">And we were going very fast along the Autobahn and elsewhere with, the whole division was traveling.</span> <span id="s9">In fact, at one one time, I should say I was with special troops, the Infantry Forward, Division Forward.</span> <span id="s10">And one time we were as much as 200 miles away from Division Rear.</span> <span id="s11">So we were going very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">PS: Did you say Spiker?</span> <span id="s13">The</span></p> <p><span id="s14">JE: Spiker is where we, yeah, it's where we landed.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">PS: Was that in northern, up around the Belgian border?</span> <span id="s16">Or</span></p> <p><span id="s17">JE: No, that was a, that was more or less I would say it's south of that</span></p> <p><span id="s18">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">JE: South of that, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">PS: At that time, Dr. Eingorn, did you know of the existence of this particular camp that you would eventually liberate before you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">JE: No, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s22">We, I knew that the Jews were put in concentration camps, but I did not know of the existence of, or the name of Ohrdruf [sub camp of Buchenwald].</span></p> <p><span id="s23">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JE: It meant nothing to me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">PS: Before you arrived at Ohrdruf, had you heard anything at all about the mass murder of Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">JE: Yes, I had.</span> <span id="s27">I had known that before I even went into the service, which was in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">PS: Did you know of the existence of, the mass murder of the con--the ovens, the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">JE: I knew nothing of gas chambers.</span> <span id="s30">I'm not even sure I knew about the ovens.</span> <span id="s31">I just knew that there was mass killings of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">PS: Before you arrived at the site of the concentration camp, did you see any evidence of German atrocities against civilians, against prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">JE: [pause] Uh, no, no.</span> <span id="s34">I had not seen at all.</span> <span id="s35">Later I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">JE: Much later, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">PS: But through France or whatever occupied country you advanced through you saw actually no evidence of atrocities.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">JE: Well, if you consider interminable lines of refugees going from one place to another, in fact if I had an impression to make, I would say that these refugees were streaming from all areas of the country, into France, from France, into Germany.</span> <span id="s40">It was an unusual sight to see, thousands of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">PS: And, did you have any experience, prior to the concentration camp, of liberating any prisoner of war camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">JE: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">PS: To the best of your memory, oh, well first, can you give the name of the camp you liberated?</span> <span id="s44">And its location?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JE: We liberated the camp of Ohrdruf, and in fact, it may have been the first camp liberated.</span> <span id="s46">And it was such a shock to the commanding officers of the United States Army that Eisenhower issued an order that everyone in our division had to go through it.</span> <span id="s47">And this was strictly signed by every commander who had to attest that every man in his--under him, had to see this.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">PS: Can you describe the general location of Ohrdruf?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">JE: Well, this is hard to tell without looking at a map, but it's, it must have been 100 miles west of the Czechoslovakian border, something like that I would imagine, but I cannot say for sure now where, exactly where it was unless I look at a map.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">PS: In reference to Buchenwald, I think it was about 60 miles from Buchenwald, I think to the northwest, which would place it I guess around the area of the city of Weimar, of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">JE: I can't say for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">PS: Do you, can you recall approximately the date that you came upon the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">JE: I believe it was early April, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">PS: To the best of your memory, can you please describe what you saw at the camp, and what you felt at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">JE: Yes.</span> <span id="s56">We had a twelve unit dispensary assigned to special troops of the 79th Infantry Division and all twelve of us, the twelve men, Major Görki [phonetic] who commanded it, and myself, Captain Eingorn, and we went together.</span> <span id="s57">And we saw just piles of bodies, nothing, most of them naked, and practically skeletons.</span> <span id="s58">Very, very undernourished.</span> <span id="s59">And then we saw the railroad ties where they had just piled up the bodies, with beechwood, and then coated them with beechwood creosote and would be burning them.</span> <span id="s60">And it was still smoking.</span> <span id="s61">Some bodies were burned completely, some were not.</span> <span id="s62">And there was just a, two or three places like that that had places where the bodies were burned.</span> <span id="s63">I don't know if they were burned while they were still alive or not, but it was, just bodies littered all over, including the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">PS: Can you estimate how many survivors were still there, living, alive when you entered the camp of Ohrdruf?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">JE: When I entered, there were no survivors.</span> <span id="s66">No one was alive.</span> <span id="s67">It was my under standing, later on I found out that the S.S. in order to sort of keep this a secret, they marched all the survivors out of the camp the day before we got there.</span> <span id="s68">And as the weaker ones fell by the wayside or the, by the side of the march, they would just kill them and bury them hastily and we were able to follow the trail.</span> <span id="s69">That is, our people in our division were able to follow the trail by seeing the, opening up the newly, the new graves.</span> <span id="s70">And we thought that was even a worse travesty in a way because at least some of these had a chance to be saved and instead they were being herded away and so as to escape detection and I don't think, they didn't escape detection because they were found anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">PS: So you saw actually no living survivors at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">JE: No, no, no, I saw no survivors in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">PS: Can you estimate like how many dead that you saw around the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">JE: Difficult, but I would say in the hundreds.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">PS: And the condition of the bodies or carcasses, did it appear that most of them were simply starved to death?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">JE: Unbelievably emaciated, yes.</span> <span id="s77">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">PS: And there were many who showed evidence of having been, a recent attempt to destroy the evidence of having the bodies laying around the camps such as, you mentioned about railroad ties, and the attempt to cover it up by burning all of the evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">JE: That might be the way that the bodies were in general eliminated, I mean as a quote normal, unquote, procedure.</span> <span id="s80">But we do know that they were, those that were alive were herded out of the camp and forced to flee the American Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">PS: Among the, there being no living survivors that you saw, among the dead, did you see any children?</span> <span id="s82">Bodies of children?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">JE: [pause] I don't believe so.</span> <span id="s84">I don't believe so.</span> <span id="s85">[pause] Actually, it seemed to me that there were mostly men.</span> <span id="s86">I'm not sure I saw any women.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">PS: No children, and very few if any women?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">JE: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">PS: Do you know if this particular camp Ohrdruf was set up for Jews only or if it was a mixed camp with mixed nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JE: I can't say for sure, but I would imagine it was, I, I thought at the time it was Jews only.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">PS: Can you please describe your personal responsibilities, if any, that you had been assigned in arranging.</span> <span id="s92">Of course there were no living to be transferred or cared for.</span> <span id="s93">Were there any responsibilities that you or your men had in connection with burying the bodies or in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">JE: No, no.</span> <span id="s95">We, I had no direct connection with it at all.</span> <span id="s96">We just, we were just ordered to see it, and as far as I know every one of the 20,000 or so troops in our division went to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">PS: You say they all went to see it.</span> <span id="s98">Now some of your, you were in a battalion that actually was involved in actually entering Ohrdruf initially, then probably there were other regiments, other battalions who were far from Ohrdruf at the time</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JE: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">PS: Of liberation.</span> <span id="s101">So that when you say that they were, all troops in your division</span></p> <p><span id="s102">JE: Our division, our division, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">PS: So some actually were maybe 20, 30, 40 miles from Ohrdruf at the time of liberation of Ohrdruf.</span> <span id="s104">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JE: Oh, [unclear] distances.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">JE: In fact as we proceeded forward we didn't stop and stay there for any length of time.</span> <span id="s108">We didn't, we went forward into Czechoslovakia and I'm sure that following, troops following had to see this, saw too.</span> <span id="s109">Because I understand it wasn't just our division.</span> <span id="s110">I think Eisenhower's, all the people in that area, all the combat personnel had to go see it, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">PS: Were there, at the time that you entered Ohrdruf, do you think or did you see, or do you believe, that there were any German guards or S.S. still within the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">JE: We saw a few dead German guards.</span> <span id="s113">They were exceptionally well-fed and of course, we knew undoubtedly that this was an S.S. man; this was not.</span> <span id="s114">[unclear] still show the guards in uniform.</span> <span id="s115">But they're dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">PS: Do you think that they were killed by, or, when the S.S. and guards started to flee, do you think maybe they were the last few remaining and were killed by surviving inmates?</span> <span id="s117">Or do you think that your troops upon entering possibly became engaged in fire fight with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">JE: I can't say for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">PS: No, you can't.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">JE: I can't say for sure who killed them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">PS: Well, there was no, I was gonna ask you if there was any verbal communication, in view of the language barrier.</span> <span id="s122">But really, the part of, of the Ohrdruf that you saw had no</span></p> <p><span id="s123">JE: No survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">PS: No one with whom to</span></p> <p><span id="s125">JE: No one, no one could talk to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">PS: Just, no one with whom to…</span></p> <p><span id="s127">JE: There was no one that appeared to be in charge of the tour as it were.</span> <span id="s128">You just walked in there and you just were on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">PS: Just the dead</span></p> <p><span id="s130">JE: Just the piles of the dead and later on I had occasion to visit a, nearby, and if my memory serves me correctly about three or four days later, a camp which had 150 Hungarian Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s131">And the name, I don't remember the name or the exact locale, but at this time I was able to talk to these Jewish girls in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s132">And I got the story from many, many of them and exactly what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s133">And to this camp we brought some food, ourselves.</span> <span id="s134">We personally delivered food and whatever we could give them.</span> <span id="s135">We were actually a combat unit.</span> <span id="s136">We didn't have big stores of food, but whatever we, that we could spare we brought over to them.</span> <span id="s137">And mostly they wanted support, mostly they wanted to see fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s138">And they wanted to see the Americans.</span> <span id="s139">And they, I guess, probably starved for the sight of an eligible man.</span> <span id="s140">That was a--we were able to speak to them in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s141">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s142">PS: Dr. Eingorn, after leaving the concentration camp of Ohrdruf, was it, would you say a week or two weeks before you stumbled on this camp with the Hungarian women?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">JE: I would say, I said four days before, but maybe as much as a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">PS: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">JE: I don't really know for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">PS: Was that camp, do you have any idea of whether it was set up as a labor, and the fact that they were all Jewish women from Hungary, do you think that they were being held there on their way to one of the extermination camps or were they there, do you think, as part of a displaced persons labor, possibly labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">JE: I would, I know that they were a labor camp.</span> <span id="s148">They were, they worked hard, and whether they were women supplied to the Nazi soldiers I don't, I can't say for sure.</span> <span id="s149">But they were all young women.</span> <span id="s150">They all told the same story about their mothers and their sisters being interviewed originally and if the mothers were generally over 40 or such they were sent to the, moved to the left and if they were to remain and moved to the right or I may have it vice versa.</span> <span id="s151">And quite often the children, young children, eight, nine, were--if the mother did not seem, if the children wanted to remain with the mother, they were both exterminated.</span> <span id="s152">I mean it was as simple as that.</span> <span id="s153">I mean if you decided to go with the mother well they were both exterminated.</span> <span id="s154">But they kept these young Jewish girls there and they worked them.</span> <span id="s155">And I do know too that getting a cold there was like a death sentence.</span> <span id="s156">They all told me the same story in many ways that if you didn't appear in good health for the roll call in the morning, and you were in your bunk, then you were immediately exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">PS: And the, probably, as with other concentration camps and labor camps, there was no attempt to give any of the sick inmates any kind of medication or, no medical treatment.</span> <span id="s158">They were just left to…</span></p> <p><span id="s159">JE: If you were too sick to work you were exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">JE: You couldn't stay in your bunk for the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">PS: Approximately how many women were there at this site?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">JE: About 150…</span></p> <p><span id="s164">PS: About 150.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">JE: Women.</span> <span id="s166">150 women, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">PS: Can you describe the physical, the general physical condition as compared to the bodies, the starved bodies that you had seen in Ohrdruf?</span> <span id="s168">Were these, did they appear to give the evidence of having been better treated, better fed, or did they look like the victims of the general atrocities?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">JE: I would say that the ones that we saw were, appeared to be in a better health and they told us that the food rations were terrible and they had so little food.</span> <span id="s170">The same thing with the cabbage, cabbage soup and the bread is what they mostly had.</span> <span id="s171">But I would also say that those who were weaker were immediately killed.</span> <span id="s172">I mean if you could not work, could not report for duty even one day, you were killed.</span> <span id="s173">So we saw the ones that, we saw the actual survivors of the group.</span> <span id="s174">I don't know exactly how many started out in that camp, but we actually saw the survivors.</span> <span id="s175">They had no time to doctor anyone.</span> <span id="s176">I mean, if you had a bad cold and you could not, in fact, the story was told to me many times that they would, if someone was real sick and could not get out of bed that morning, that someone else would take a chance and call "Present" for them when their name was called.</span> <span id="s177">And if it was found out that was instant death.</span> <span id="s178">If you were answering for someone else, it was the death penalty.</span> <span id="s179">So a lot of people took chances to save those who could not report for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">PS: Getting back just for a moment to Ohrdruf how long were you there at the site of the Ohrdruf concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JE: I would say the greater, one morning, one morning.</span> <span id="s182">Yeah, one morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">PS: And there being no survivors of course there was nothing to be done but clean up and start…</span></p> <p><span id="s184">JE: Other troops…</span></p> <p><span id="s185">PS: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s186">JE: Either in our division or in succeeding troops who took care of that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">JE: We just kept going, kept on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">PS: And probably Ohrdruf being, I believe, the first concentration camp to be liberated by the Americans, of course if there's no survivors and all the dead it's, using the term "liberation" is, yeah, a frustrating word to use when there was really nobody living, no one left alive there to liberate.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">JE: Well, there were those that were liberated, who were marched out before our troops got in there.</span> <span id="s191">And some, as I say, fell by the wayside and were buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">PS: There were…</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JE: But we finally got, we finally found some, you know.</span> <span id="s194">But not to my personal knowledge, but I do know that as stories were told that they did find…</span></p> <p><span id="s195">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">JE: …some others, but not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">PS: Well when they were marched out of Ohrdruf, they were probably marched out with the German guards…</span></p> <p><span id="s198">JE: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">PS: And probably being just, trying to transport them to another death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">JE: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">PS: Your experience in this camp with Hungarian Jewish women, how long were you there, Doctor, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">JE: I was there for a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">PS: One day.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">JE: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">PS: Were you, you've mentioned that, even though you stumbled on the, on this site, had no knowledge of it being there, you didn't approach it knowing it was there with the, for the purpose of saving, but you mentioned that you were prepared to some extent to feed them, you had some food to offer.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">JE: Whatever food was, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">PS: Did your unit have…</span></p> <p><span id="s208">JE: Medical supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">PS: Medical supplies?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JE: Medical supplies, sure.</span> <span id="s211">We were a dispensary, and so we had some medical supplies, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s213">So, every attempt possible was made to give these women the medical, all pow--all within your power to do for them what you could medically.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">JE: Of course, but we were there like I say just for one day.</span> <span id="s215">And we were not troops that were stationed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">JE: We just kept going along.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">PS: Well but then to your knowledge there were troops coming up behind you…</span></p> <p><span id="s219">JE: Oh yeah, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s220">PS: That probably were better prepared with food, medical supplies, medical officers…</span></p> <p><span id="s221">JE: I'm sure, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">PS: And you say you were only there for the one…</span></p> <p><span id="s223">JE: I would say just one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">PS: Just one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">JE: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">PS: Here again, the fact that children were separated, so there again at this site, you saw no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">JE: No.</span> <span id="s228">The girls must have been anywheres from, I'm gonna guess here, from 18 to 30.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">PS: And they evidently had been taken out of lines, selected, for whatever purpose this camp was being used for.</span> <span id="s230">Did your experience of seeing all the horrible, horrible deaths at Ohrdruf and these women, Hungarian Jewish women, did it have any effect on your feeling about being a part of the war, and fighting Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">JE: Well, I had always felt that as a Jew it was my duty in a way, as much as anyone's, to see Hitler destroyed.</span> <span id="s232">And so it only vindicated my feelings there.</span> <span id="s233">[unclear] Because I felt that he, no matter what preceded it, with everything else, he really had to be destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">PS: Do you recall the reaction of other men in your unit?</span> <span id="s235">Did you talk with them afterwards about what you and they had experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">JE: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s237">We certainly did.</span> <span id="s238">And we had a, our commander of our little dispensary, [unclear] dispensary, the Major Görki, who was a first generation German, and we had some interesting discussions about it.</span> <span id="s239">And, more than interesting.</span> <span id="s240">And we had a few Italians, and as well as a few other Jews on our, in our dispensary, so we, and we were very intimate and, because we were always quartered together.</span> <span id="s241">And so we did, the Jews themselves, I felt that I knew that these things had existed, because I had read about the left and the right and those who, those who went to their death and those that were permitted to stay alive.</span> <span id="s242">I had known about that.</span> <span id="s243">I felt I had known about that.</span> <span id="s244">But the other Jews, who didn't know anything about it, they were surprised, completely surprised by this.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">PS: After experiencing what you did experience, at the two sites--Ohrdruf and this camp for women--it probably had a lingering effect on your thinking as you look back, as you reminisce?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">JE: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s247">And I've often wondered, “Could it happen in the United States?”</span> <span id="s248">And I've come to the conclusion it could happen anywheres.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">PS: When you saw, and this is going back for one moment to the concentration camp of Ohrdruf, when you first saw Ohrdruf, the horrors, the bodies, the carcasses, the attempts to conceal, were you aware at that time that this was only one of many, many concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JE: I knew there were other concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">PS: Did you have in your wildest imagination any thought that this could be on the scale--you saw possibly say a thousand, two or three thousand bodies.</span> <span id="s252">Did you in your wildest imagination ever think that it could be six million Jews, twelve million overall who were massacred?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">JE: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">PS: Annihilated in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">JE: I never conceived of those numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">PS: In your own mind, can you explain the German decisions that led to the setting up of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">JE: [chuckles; taken back] I don't want to be an apologist for the Germans.</span> <span id="s258">They, it started out with Kristallnacht where they found a, what they called a legal excuse to take away property from the Jews and to change the laws regarding Jews, as if they were non-persons.</span> <span id="s259">And then it gradually proceeded, especially as they started losing the war, it gradually proceeded to use the Jew as the, as a big scapegoat, as a measure of their success in doing what they promised to do.</span> <span id="s260">And probably the only area in where they really were successful in their promise was the annihilation of so many Jews.</span> <span id="s261">And, it has to be a certain warped mentality that starts to figure out the most efficient way to carry out such a heinous undertaking.</span> <span id="s262">I mean, to find the best gas, to find the quickest way to do it, and the best scientific German brains worked on this.</span> <span id="s263">The medical men worked on this, to try and find out the best way and kill someone, the least problems, the most amount of personal belongings, as if it was a reformation project of some kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">PS: You know, bringing that up, I think many people in going over the same subject, realizing that Germany at that time was probably one of the most advanced societies in the world, in the field of science and all the arts, medicine, every branch of science and the educational system, and yet this was the society that was responsible for breeding probably one of, well not probably, but by far the worst massacre for all these, where medical, where prominent doctors performed brain surgery, you know experimental surgery; nurses were involved in experimental ways to do away with people.</span> <span id="s265">It sort of ties in with the fact that this, the type of society it was and you mentioned their efficiency.</span> <span id="s266">Do you see any connection there between that very highly-educated society, especially in the fields of science, do you think there's any relativity here between that and the methods of extermination?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">JE: Well, they had enormous numbers of people that they intended to kill, and they did it in a, sometimes very crudely, as you can see in Ohrdruf where they just used beechwood creosote and railroad ties as a furnace, and the gas chambers where they had the best kind of, the fastest gas that they used, and on a mass basis.</span> <span id="s268">Their science, like any other part of the German development or civilization, was corrupted.</span> <span id="s269">It was, the government was run by criminals, and the criminals rose to the top, and those people who protested were killed and those people who accepted or refused to believe, or chose not to believe, were advanced, and so it was a, the stupidity of the people.</span> <span id="s270">People who were, greed, doctors wanted to advance to the higher positions and they committed this and even theologians looked the other way and committed it, let alone the ordinary person.</span> <span id="s271">So I think the government was being taken over by criminals, the criminal element, and those, and a lot of people, for whatever reason, nationalism, greed, inertia, accepted it, and permitted this to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">PS: How…</span></p> <p><span id="s273">JE: I might mention one thing in this connection.</span> <span id="s274">You asked me about German medicine and things like that.</span> <span id="s275">Well, like I told you, Major Görki was a first generation German from the Los Angeles area.</span> <span id="s276">We, later on we went to a German hospital, which took care of, as I understood, Poles and Russians.</span> <span id="s277">And we spoke to this physician who was a colonel.</span> <span id="s278">And I remember him sitting at the desk, and being very proper and saluting us.</span> <span id="s279">And he had realized the war was over, and he had a long, long list of admissions, and a beautifully tended grave yard out back.</span> <span id="s280">And we asked him, "How many," that Major Görki asked him, he says, "How many admissions have you had in the year or so since you've been here?"</span> <span id="s281">And he says, "Well, he's had 1500 admissions."</span> <span id="s282">And he says, "Well, how many are out in the grave?"</span> <span id="s283">And he says, "About 1100."</span> <span id="s284">And he said that, "How many were alive?"</span> <span id="s285">He says, "About 200 were alive."</span> <span id="s286">And he said, "How many were ever discharged from this hospital?"</span> <span id="s287">And he says, "Well," he says, "maybe 200 were discharged."</span> <span id="s288">Now, we're talking about 1100 graves, 200 still living, and 200 that were discharged.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">PS: From that 1500.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">JE: And, Görki, who was the physician, exploded.</span> <span id="s291">He says, "You mean to tell me that this is German medicine?"</span> <span id="s292">He says, "What kind of a hospital is this that out of 1500 has only been able to discharge 200 people?"</span> <span id="s293">He says, "This is just a death camp!"</span> <span id="s294">He says, "You call yourself a doctor?"</span> <span id="s295">He really, really laid it hard on him.</span> <span id="s296">The man didn't say too much.</span> <span id="s297">But he had very great records.</span> <span id="s298">He had every plot marked out, every admission marked out, everything was there.</span> <span id="s299">But I understand it was for Poles and Russians, prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">PS: And where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">JE: This was in that same general area.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">PS: Oh, of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">JE: Yeah.</span> <span id="s304">Of Germany, yeah.</span> <span id="s305">About a couple days after the Hungarian camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">PS: How long did you remain in Europe after the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">JE: The war ended May the 8th, May the 9th, and I left Europe March of the following year.</span> <span id="s308">March of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">PS: So you were there about ten months, in Germany about ten months after.</span> <span id="s310">During that period following the German surrender and the liberation of all the concentration camps, of all the displaced persons camps, did you see the return of survivors or, and the distribution of the displaced persons?</span> <span id="s311">Do you have any comments on…</span></p> <p><span id="s312">JE: Well, the only thing is that we started to, now to see refugees, German refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s314">PS: The interview with Dr. Julius Eingorn, for the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College, continues.</span> <span id="s315">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s316">JE: As I was saying, now the tide of refugees swung in a third direction.</span> <span id="s317">We were now starting to see German refugees.</span> <span id="s318">People had started to come in from the Prussian, well this was the Prussian area, and the Austrian area, and they were coming back into Germany to escape the Russians.</span> <span id="s319">And we were seeing a complete reversal of the tide of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">PS: These were Germans who were refugees from camps in Poland?</span> <span id="s321">Like prisoners of war more so…</span></p> <p><span id="s322">JE: No, no!</span> <span id="s323">These were German civilians who were now starting to travel.</span> <span id="s324">This might not be what you want but it's the overall…</span></p> <p><span id="s325">PS: No, no, this is…</span></p> <p><span id="s326">JE: This was, these were German civilians who were, who had been occupying Austria and maybe some in Poland who had maybe settled there, and there's a Prussian area near Poland, and Czechoslovakia, who were now streaming back into heartland Germany.</span> <span id="s327">And it was complete reversal.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">PS: Oh, I…</span></p> <p><span id="s329">JE: We were also getting towards the end of the war, which, and, in April, May, we were getting whole divisions of Germans surrendering to us.</span> <span id="s330">We were roughly a small number of people, but we at sometimes would have in one day we'd get four or five thousand prisoners would come in, en masse, with their commanding officers and every thing else, and just be herded into some school yard or something.</span> <span id="s331">And temporarily.</span> <span id="s332">There was no way that we could take care of all this many prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">PS: In those ten months that you remained in Germany after the end of the war, did you see many Jewish refugees, refugee survivors of concentration camps?</span> <span id="s334">Did you see many of them returning to their home regions?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">JE: No.</span> <span id="s336">We were getting the story from Germans, say a German wife of, who had been married to a Jew who had been sent to a concentration camp, or, some who were hidden, was hidden by this German spouse, and because some marriages were still kept intact and the Jewish partner was hidden by the German spouse.</span> <span id="s337">And we kept hearing stories of that.</span> <span id="s338">Of course a lot of the stories were also self-serving, meaning we, you know, you walk into, you go into a German town and where three days before they had been spitting at British prisoners of war, when we came in there they were all anti-Nazis.</span> <span id="s339">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s340">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s341">[both laugh]</span></p> <p><span id="s342">JE: You know, you know the stories…</span></p> <p><span id="s343">PS: Everything…</span></p> <p><span id="s344">JE: The stories were not always to be believed…</span></p> <p><span id="s345">PS: Everything suddenly changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">JE: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">PS: Dr. Eingorn, I have reached the end of the questions that I had in mind to ask you during this interview.</span> <span id="s348">Do you have anything at all that you would like to add to your testimony, anything that we haven't covered so far?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">JE: Well, I was telling you about the--I didn't tell you anything about the British prisoners of war that we liberated, but we had, a number of them would come in and they would say to us, you know, we gave them what we had, and sometimes they were like, from the K-rations we had the concentrated fruit bars, or the chocolate and we'd give them what we had.</span> <span id="s350">And they would come into our dispensary the next day with all kind of stomach ailments, diarrhea, because the food was much too rich for them.</span> <span id="s351">And, a few of them we were talking to and we were, since we were both English speaking, we'd say, "Why are you doing what you're doing?"</span> <span id="s352">They would go through the town, they would kick people off the sidewalk, and make them walk in the gutter.</span> <span id="s353">So they said, "That's what they did to us."</span> <span id="s354">They said, "We'd go to work in a labor camp of some kind, go to labor, and the kids would spit on us, make us walk in the gutter."</span> <span id="s355">He says, "Now two days later since you've come, since you Yanks have come," he says, "why, everybody's anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s356">No one knows anything.</span> <span id="s357">No one knows anything what happened down the road."</span> <span id="s358">Incidentally, all these people around Ohrdruf that we interviewed, I know that knew nothing.</span> <span id="s359">And they all claimed, disclaimed knowledge of what was happening.</span> <span id="s360">Or if they saw fires or anything like that, they averted their eyes.</span> <span id="s361">They said they didn't know what was burning.</span> <span id="s362">And, a complete sense of non guilt.</span> <span id="s363">I might also say that in the month of March, and in April, we had occasion to sleep at maybe 20, 25 different types of German houses, farm houses, and city, urban houses, and I can tell you that there wasn't one where there wasn't a picture of Christ in the bedroom, as well as a dozen pair of leather shoes which they had gotten from other countries.</span> <span id="s364">And, so I could never understand this kind of belief in God, and the action that they were carrying out.</span> <span id="s365">But they were, generally they had a picture of Christ, and quite often the same picture in their bedrooms.</span> <span id="s366">And as I was telling you before, I don't know whether you taped it or not, I really feel it can happen here, if we're not vigilant, and we don't stand up for certain ideals, and permit lying to go on, I think it could happen any, in any country in the world, especially in a civilized country.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">PS: Which is really one of the reasons that we are gathering this testimony from many hundreds of survivors and now we're of course gathering testimony from liberators.</span> <span id="s368">Some day, we hope it won't have to be used, but some day this may be called upon to prove the credibility of what did happen there in Germany and occupied, countries occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s369">Dr. Eingorn, this tape of your testimony will become a permanent part of the Holocaust Oral History Archives of Gratz College, and on behalf of Gratz College I want to thank you very, very much for your very valuable, and certainly your most important testimony.</span> <span id="s370">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">JE: You're welcome.</span></p></body></html>
