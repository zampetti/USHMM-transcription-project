Mom, I’m leaving.</span> <span id="s689">Where you going?</span> <span id="s690">I’m going to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s691">That time – this was 1940, I think, when the Russian made a – Hitler make a pact with Stalin, they not gonna go to war any more, they go – not gonna fight.</span> <span id="s692">You know, they say you take this part of Poland and I take that part of Poland.</span> <span id="s693">So the Russian, they took one part of Poland, like [indecipherable] Wilno.</span> <span id="s694">They make a border and my brother says, this wasn’t – I think it was in

package from Russia, oil, soap, little things.</span> <span id="s705">And he wrote in Polish that he was in Lvov, he – he voluntary resisted to – to – to go to the – to Russia, because lot of – lot of Jews that was there, they didn’t want to go voluntary you know?</span> <span id="s706">So Stalin that time ordered – they order – told them they are spies.</span> <span id="s707">And they took lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s708">They went – they send them to Siberia, to Donbas.</span> <span id="s709">You know Donbas what is?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Part of Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span

we know he is alive, he is fine, my mother didn’t worry about.</span> <span id="s719">And then – and then came a order that we have to leave our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: How soon after the Germans occupied, did you have to leave your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Oh, this was in – in end – end of ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Okay, so three or four months

Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2047">Because we got the closest border, it was Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2048">So we pay money, we went in the night.</span> <span id="s2049">Not me, my brother, but he took another few families through a forest, and we line up in the Czech border, after the border with the Czech police.</span> <span id="s2050">And the Czech police says, just don’t
