<span id="s12">Could you tell us your name and where you were born and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A:My name is William Dowdell Denson.</span> <span id="s14">I was born the 31st day of May, nineteen hundred and thirteen in Birmingham, Alabama.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q:And can you tell us a bit about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A:Well, I was actually educated in the public schools of Birmingham.</span> <span id="s17">In nineteen hundred and thirty when I was 17 years of age, I was appointed to the United States military academy at West Point, New York.</span> <span id="s18">I entered there in July of that year, and I graduated from there in June of nineteen hundred and thirty‑four.</span> <span id="s19">I resigned my commission in the United States Army and was accepted as a student at Harvard Law School, which I attended from September of 1934 until graduating in June of 1937.</span> <span id="s20">That is the basis of my undoing.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q:And how come you got interested in the law?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A:Well, I guess that was kind of natural.</span> <span id="s23">My great‑grandfather on my mother's side was a member of Congress in eighteen hundred and fifty‑five and continued there until Alabama succeeded from the Union.</span> <span id="s24">At that time he became a colonel in command of the 37th Infantry Regiment of Alabama and participated in the siege of Vicksburg.</span> <span id="s25">He was a lawyer and enjoyed the law apparently very much.</span> <span id="s26">On myhis son, rather, would go backtake the maternal side first.</span> <span id="s27">My great‑grandfather that I just described had a son by the name of James Rendar (ph) Dowdell.</span> <span id="s28">He also was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s29">And, in fact, he was a chief justice of the supreme court of Alabama which is the highest judicial court of that state.</span> <span id="s30">And my father, I'm skipping now to my pappy's side of the house, and he, of course, was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s31">And his father was a congressman and the United States attorney for the northern district of Alabama.</span> <span id="s32">So I sort of come by the law in a natural fashion.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">01:03:25</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q:And going to West Point?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A:I went to West Point in</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q:Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A:Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q:Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A:I went to West Point back after I graduated both from Harvard and from the military academy.</span> <span id="s40">I went back to West Point to teach law there in January of nineteen hundred and forty‑two and taught law there until January of nineteen hundred and forty‑five, at which time I was ordered to join the headquarters of the United States Army, 3rd United States Army.</span> <span id="s41">And I was a member of the judge advocate's section of that army.</span> <span id="s42">And I joined them in February of 1945.</span> <span id="s43">Now, my duties in the judge advocate's section in the Headquarters 3rd Army was to have charge of the administration of military justice, which was familiar to me because of my teaching also of military justice at West Point from '42 until '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q:Can we go back just a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q:When you were at Harvard, the Nazis had taken over in Germany.</span> <span id="s47">And when you were at Harvard in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws had been passed.</span> <span id="s48">Was there any discussion at Harvard about what was going on in Nazi Germany that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A:No, sir.</span> <span id="s50">At that time, and because curriculum was kind of rough and tough for a country boy like me, I didn't concern myself with much more than trying to study the cases that had been assigned.</span> <span id="s51">And there wasn't much discussion either from the professors, nor among the students as to the situation in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s52">And nothingI knew nothing of the Nuremberg Laws other than the fact that there were indeed Nuremberg Laws that had been passed.</span> <span id="s53">And as such, they were discriminatory highly, and something that hardly anybody could be proud of.</span> <span id="s54">But there was never any teaching at Harvard about the Nuremberg Laws at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q:When did you first become aware of oppression in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A:To be honest with you, the first that I really recall was Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s57">That was in November of nineteen hundred and thirty‑eight, if I'm not mistaken.</span> <span id="s58">At that time the pogroms had started.</span> <span id="s59">And actually they started even before then.</span> <span id="s60">But that was the event that produced a notoriety in that I think the whole world knew about it from that time or from that time on.</span> <span id="s61">And it was rather a shock to me, because I had a number of very dear friends who were Jewish that I had grown up with in grammar school, high school and in West Point and at Harvard.</span> <span id="s62">So it wasit came as quite a shock to me that that sort of thing was then taking place.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">01:07:15</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q:Did you know anything about the ship to St. Louis that had been coming from Europe to Cuba and was not letpeople were not let into Cuba and then they weren't let in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A:No.</span> <span id="s66">I never heard that until I became more involved with this matter.</span> <span id="s67">War crimes and indiscriminations that had occurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q:So that until you became involved in the war crimes trials, your knowledge of what was going on was really quite small then?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A:It was negligible.</span> <span id="s70">And I knew even less about communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q:So tell me, did you want this job in the judge advocate's office?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A:I would say this, that probably I recognized it as a professional challenge and one that I would certainly like to entertain.</span> <span id="s73">And I considered myself fortunate to have received the designation in that capacity.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q:But you didn't know what you were getting into?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A:I certainly did not.</span> <span id="s76">I would do it again, though.</span> <span id="s77">Even now that I know it.</span> <span id="s78">But I think that I started to say I wouldn't change anything, but I'm sure that upon reflection I might have changed a lot of things.</span> <span id="s79">But I couldn't tell you right now what I would have changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q:When did you first become immersed in the kind of material you would be confronting, the kind of evidence you'd be confronting?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A:Well, in Headquarters 3rd Army we had a war crimes team that went along with the combat troops.</span> <span id="s82">And that was true in all of the combat units.</span> <span id="s83">The war crimes investigating teams were groups of individuals, lawyers, investigators, and supporting personnel, that investigated atrocities as the combat troops uncovered them.</span> <span id="s84">And some of those things drifted into the Headquarters of 3rd Army.</span> <span id="s85">And our judge advocateI mean a staff judge advocate at that time was a colonel by the name of Colonel Charles E. Cheever (ph).</span> <span id="s86">And he had an assistant by the name of Josephs that was handling the war crimes aspects at that time.</span> <span id="s87">They were later handled by a classmate of mine, as I said, Colonel O'Connell.</span> <span id="s88">But in the conversations, the existence of some of these atrocities did become the subject of our conversations.</span> <span id="s89">So it was, I would say, before, slightly before, not much before May 7th of 1945.</span> <span id="s90">And, of course, May 7th was the day when hostilities ceased.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q:So you learned something before you went to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A:No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s93">May 7th of 1945.</span> <span id="s94">I was in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s95">I went over to Germany, I went to Headquarters 3rd Army in February of 1945.</span> <span id="s96">But actually I don't remember very much war crimes activity until we were stationed in Munich at the rear echelon of Headquarters 3rd Army was stationed in Munich.</span> <span id="s97">And I think it was there when I really first learned anything about t he war crimes proceedings that were being uncovered and the events that took place thereafter.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q:Can you tell us some of your first impressions as you began to look at this evidence for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A:Well, the first time that I ever had a chance to look at the evidence actually was, I think, in the beginning or middle of August of nineteen hundred and forty‑five.</span> <span id="s100">And those were some of the reports and findings that the war crimes investigating teams had made to the judge advocate's section in Headquarters 3rd Army.</span> <span id="s101">Patton was the commanding general at that time.</span> <span id="s102">And the teams that would be actually at Dachau was just 17 kilometers west of Munich.</span> <span id="s103">And at that time we were conscious of what washad gone along at Dachau.</span> <span id="s104">I didn't actually visit the camp until I think some time in July of 1945.</span> <span id="s105">Our headquarters were in the-- what they call the house of __________________ in Munich.</span> <span id="s106">And 17 kilometers didn't particularly interest me at that time at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q:What was the nature of the evidence that you were looking at when you</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A:At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q:From the war crimes team?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A:From the war crimes team were reports that were sent in by the investigators and interrogators.</span> <span id="s111">And to look at them and to read them was not to comprehend them.</span> <span id="s112">Not that they were written in incomprehensive language.</span> <span id="s113">But the events that they described were incredible.</span> <span id="s114">And at first there was sort of attitude that thissome of these people had too many Schnapps when they were writing the reports.</span> <span id="s115">But that of course is in jest.</span> <span id="s116">Never was any such feeling toward the investigators at all.</span> <span id="s117">But the events that they described were so incredible that you couldn't help but have a feeling of that, the presence of being depicting events and reciting events in the reports that were so far out from the normal course of events that it was just incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q:There were a number of lawyers with you?</span> <span id="s119">About 30 lawyers?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A:In the</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q:That were working with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A:At that time we had quite a number of lawyers in the judge advocate's section.</span> <span id="s123">And in the war crimes teams there were actually quiteI don't recall at this particular moment how many lawyers there were.</span> <span id="s124">But investigators, interrogators and lawyers were 40, 50‑odd individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q:Did you talk about this evidence that was coming in?</span> <span id="s126">Were most people equally as incredulous as you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">01:15:00</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A:Well, I'm sure that they were.</span> <span id="s129">I don't think there's much doubt about the fact that anybody that came in contact with them, with the evidence, of course, they saw it.</span> <span id="s130">It was a credible matter to them.</span> <span id="s131">But from the secondhand on, it was an incredible matter.</span> <span id="s132">And the biggest problem that I had after I was designated to prosecute these case, the biggest problem that I had was believing or getting testimony that could be believed.</span> <span id="s133">Because of it's nature.</span> <span id="s134">Not that it wasn't true; it was true.</span> <span id="s135">But the events that were depicted were so horrible, were so sadistic, were so monstrous, that they were incredible.</span> <span id="s136">That's the only way to describe it.</span> <span id="s137">And I was a skeptic.</span> <span id="s138">I didn't believe it at that time.</span> <span id="s139">I didn't start believing it until I really started digging into with the concept and with the authority that I was going to prosecute the Dachau concentration camp case.</span> <span id="s140">At that time when I started talking to witnesses, and I heard events there that were so out of line, that they were incredible.</span> <span id="s141">I could give you an event that perhaps might depict it.</span> <span id="s142">In all of these camps there was place in the camp called the arrest bunker.</span> <span id="s143">And in the arrest bunker there was some cells which were called the standing cells.</span> <span id="s144">They were instruments of torture in reality because they were so small and so constructed that it was almost impossible foralmost impossible--it was impossible for a prisoner who had been committed to one of these cells to either lie down or to sit.</span> <span id="s145">He had to stand in order to be within the confines of the cell.</span> <span id="s146">And these S.S. men who were in charge of the arrest bunker would put prisoners in there for punishment.</span> <span id="s147">They received no food, no water, and no chance to sit down or lie down, or change their position for three to five days.</span> <span id="s148">And sometimes longer if they lived that long.</span> <span id="s149">Then at the end of the period of time, they'd take them out.</span> <span id="s150">And if they were still alive, they would sit them down to a table.</span> <span id="s151">And on that table would be a vessel with two or more liters of water in it.</span> <span id="s152">Well, the poor emaciated prisoner starved by thirst and absolutely out of his mind took the liters of water and guzzled it down immediately.</span> <span id="s153">That caused the stomach of this emaciated prisoner to protrude out.</span> <span id="s154">When that happened, the S.S. man who was there would drive his fist into that stomach.</span> <span id="s155">Or if he couldn't sit, throw him down on the ground and then stomp that protruding stomach with his heel, rupturing the walls of the stomach, and the prisoner died of an agonizing death.</span> <span id="s156">Now, looking at you, you don't look like you believe it either, but it happened.</span> <span id="s157">It was one of the things that happened.</span> <span id="s158">And it happened not only in Dachau, which was the case I was concerned with at that time, but in Mauthausen, Flossenbürg and Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q:Let's stop now.</span> <span id="s160">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">01:19:25</span></p> <p><span id="s162">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s163">02:00:20</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q:Bill, You gave us an example of what would make you be skeptical.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q:What caused you not to become skeptical?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A:Well, being skeptical we looked around and we finally got a hold of other witnesses and interrogated them and found out that some of them had witnessed this same event that I just described to you.</span> <span id="s168">And I interrogated those witnesses very, very closely and very, very carefully to find out as many details as each of them could recall.</span> <span id="s169">And low and behold the details that these other witnesses gave me dove‑tailed very closely with the incident that I just recited to you.</span> <span id="s170">And because they dove‑tailed so closely and because of this corroboration, and I knew that these witnesses had not had a chance to get together and make up the story among themselves, that that event had to have happened.</span> <span id="s171">It had to have happened because two people couldn't have imagined the same type of misconduct.</span> <span id="s172">It was so far out, it was so atrocious, so heinous, that the normal individual just couldn't imagine that sort of event taking place.</span> <span id="s173">Nevertheless, when somebody from Poland gave me that type of story, another witness from France the same thing, another from Belgium, I began to believe.</span> <span id="s174">And finally I got to the point where I could believe most anything because it all did happen.</span> <span id="s175">That was the thing that made a believer out of me.</span> <span id="s176">But it pointed up a problem that I was confronted with.</span> <span id="s177">What court now is going to hear these witnesses for the first time with such a horrible event.</span> <span id="s178">Who's going to believe that?</span> <span id="s179">You didn't.</span> <span id="s180">And it's only natural that the members of the court wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s181">So what we had to do was to sort of condition the court in this sense that I first introduced evidence of events that you would expect to have occurred in a penal environment.</span> <span id="s182">Slapping around.</span> <span id="s183">Little more force; knocking around.</span> <span id="s184">Down to beatings.</span> <span id="s185">In that various degrees.</span> <span id="s186">And in that way it conditioned the court for the bizarre events that I just described to you.</span> <span id="s187">And that was a problem that we recognized and was a major problem that served as the subject of our conversations as counsel.</span> <span id="s188">And when I say our conversations as counsel, I had assistants that were trained lawyers, wonderful men.</span> <span id="s189">And we would get together after each session and discuss among ourselves to what extent we thought we had conditioned the court so that we could bring on testimony of these bizarre events that took place.</span> <span id="s190">And it seemed to work.</span> <span id="s191">The court in all cases except one found the accused guilty of committing war crimes.</span> <span id="s192">And, well, the nature of the sentences that they imposed, they must have believed.</span> <span id="s193">We almost hit the jackpot in the Mauthausen case.</span> <span id="s194">In that case we had 61 accused in the dock that we were trying.</span> <span id="s195">And of that 61, all of them were found guilty.</span> <span id="s196">58 of them were sentenced to be hanged and three of them were sentenced to life imprisonment.</span> <span id="s197">So that was almost the jackpot.</span> <span id="s198">If they had all been sentenced to be hanged, that would have been the jackpot.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">02:05:10</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q:Were you looking for the death sentence in most of the cases that you were trying?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A:Well, let me tell you this: Looking for it is one way to put it.</span> <span id="s202">In the commission of a war crime, the maximum punishment is death by hanging.</span> <span id="s203">And depending on the circumstances, any lesser punishment as the circumstances may dictate in the mind of the court.</span> <span id="s204">So all of them, all of them were subject to having had the death sentence imposed upon them after having been found guilty.</span> <span id="s205">So that to say were you looking for it, there was some that were more guilty than others.</span> <span id="s206">And that was the second problem that we had; that of comparative sentences.</span> <span id="s207">When you try a number of people at one timeand you may wonder why we tried so many at one time.</span> <span id="s208">We had the 61 there in Mauthausen, we had 40 in Dachau, 45 in Flossenburg, and 31 in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s209">We had to have representatives out of every phase of operation of the camp, otherwise it would be only part of a picture that we were trying to establish by evidence.</span> <span id="s210">And it was important that we established the criminality of the operation of each one of these camps in every one of its phases.</span> <span id="s211">Because the charge that we were making was that each of those individuals that sat in that dock as an accused either aided, abetted, participated in the common design of subjecting these individuals to beatings, killings, tortures, starvation and death.</span> <span id="s212">So it was important to have representatives out of each phase of operation.</span> <span id="s213">And in that way the court could make a finding that it was a criminal operation in its entirety.</span> <span id="s214">We had some 3,500 accused that had been denounced in the war crimes case at Dachau.</span> <span id="s215">And we couldn't try individually each one of these on a case on the basis that we tried the parent case.</span> <span id="s216">Those were the cases that I tried, the parent case.</span> <span id="s217">You couldn't spend that much time trying each one of these individuals; 3,500.</span> <span id="s218">We'd still be trying them.</span> <span id="s219">So it was perfectly lawful to have the camp condemned as a criminal operation in its entirety.</span> <span id="s220">Then cast the burden upon these 3,500 individuals in groups of one, two, up to as many as might be essential to paint a picture.</span> <span id="s221">And let them explain away having established that they were there at the camp, at each one of these four camps, any one of them.</span> <span id="s222">And in that way you can't say that they were presumed to be guilty.</span> <span id="s223">But the burden of proof was shifted a little bit to the extent that these individuals had to come forward.</span> <span id="s224">And they did.</span> <span id="s225">Some of them come forward and say, "You got the wrong person by the wrong name.</span> <span id="s226">My name is Schwartz and this other man's name was Schwartzenegger you're talking about."</span> <span id="s227">And another one of the defenses was that "I was there for such a short period of time, I didn't know that this was a criminal operation."</span> <span id="s228">And even another defense was, "I was ordered to do it."</span> <span id="s229">Well, that was no defense at all for the simple reason that forsuperior orders is the name that they give this defense.</span> <span id="s230">For that to be a defense, the order itself that was disobeyed, if it was disobeyed you could be shot.</span> <span id="s231">That's what superior orders is a shorthand of saying it.</span> <span id="s232">These individuals would come in there, none of them ever put on any evidence to show that anybody was ever shot for disobeying an order given them in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s233">The S.S. men I'm talking about or the Kapos that worked for the S.S.and remind me to tell you about the Kapos, too.</span> <span id="s234">But the superior order defense was predicated upon the order being a lawful order.</span> <span id="s235">Well, the operation of the concentration camps were illegal under German law.</span> <span id="s236">German law still had statutes against murder.</span> <span id="s237">They had statutes against assault and battery.</span> <span id="s238">They were crimes.</span> <span id="s239">And they had individuals in the penitentiaries and in the camps for committing crimes.</span> <span id="s240">So that what was taking place in Dachau, Mauthausen, Flossenbürg and Buchenwald were crimes under German law.</span> <span id="s241">So that the law wasthe order that was given to beat a man over here, or to hang another man over here by his wrists, those were against German law.</span> <span id="s242">And since this defense of superior orders didn't prevail, that was out the window.</span> <span id="s243">And on that basis we were able to take the findings of the parent trials, those four cases that I've just described, and introduce those in evidence and then let the accused put on any evidence in mitigation that they may have at their command.</span> <span id="s244">And I would like to point out at this time that any time any accused was brought to trial, he was furnished with counsel by the United States government; that is American counsel.</span> <span id="s245">And he could have German counsel of his own choosing.</span> <span id="s246">In other words, we gave these accused in these cases all the rights that a citizen would have had he been tried for a crime in the United States district courts or the federal courts of this country.</span> <span id="s247">So we gave these accused that protection that our own citizens would have received.</span> <span id="s248">So that it's very difficult to understand the complaint that some people have with these trials saying it's nothing but victors' justice.</span> <span id="s249">That isn't true.</span> <span id="s250">That isn't true at all.</span> <span id="s251">They had a fair trial just as our citizen would have had.</span> <span id="s252">Now, I may be straying all over the lot here from what we started out with.</span> <span id="s253">I wanted to explain to you the fact that the defense of superior orders had no place in these trials at all.</span> <span id="s254">And prior to that I think I wanted to point out to you that there were circumstances in these cases which required a great number of accused in order to establish the criminality, criminality of these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q:Each camp had to be proven as</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A:A criminal operation in its entirety.</span> <span id="s257">That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q:In order that you could then try all these thousands of other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A:That is correct.</span> <span id="s260">That's right.</span> <span id="s261">Otherwise you would have to establish the same thing for each one of these individuals.</span> <span id="s262">And with 3,500 individual cases, that just wasn't a feasible proposition.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q:I'm going to ask you something about the witnesses and the accused.</span> <span id="s264">But I wanted to go back a little bit to the court itself.</span> <span id="s265">Who made up the judges?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A:The court was called a Military Government Court.</span> <span id="s267">Now, the Military Government Court was one aspect in which the United States government participated in the war crimes program in Europe.</span> <span id="s268">First you had the I.M.T., the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s269">That was no part of what we were doing at Dachau.</span> <span id="s270">Then you had the subsequent proceedings in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s271">And that was triedthose were tribunals that were appointed by the Allied Control Council but were not international in nature but were all U.S. citizens that were involved.</span> <span id="s272">And the third was a Military Government Courts which were courts that were appointed by the military.</span> <span id="s273">Now, the first Dachau court was appointed by General Lucien Truscott, who was the commanding general of 3rd U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s274">And that was done under the aegis of the staff judge advocate for the European Theater of the United States Forces.</span> <span id="s275">USTEF, we called it.</span> <span id="s276">And these individuals that were appointed to the court were senior field grade officers with the rank of full colonel.</span> <span id="s277">And they were composed of anywhere from seven to nine officers.</span> <span id="s278">And they were presided over by a general officer, usually a brigadier general or a major general, as the case may be.</span> <span id="s279">And these were men of stature in their profession.</span> <span id="s280">And they acted as fact‑finders as well as applying the law.</span> <span id="s281">Now, the law was neing given them by what was known as the law member on the court.</span> <span id="s282">He was usually a lawyer who had had extensive experience and was learned in the law.</span> <span id="s283">And these courts functioned under the aegisthe Military Government Courts that I had anything to do with, were under the aegis of Headquarters 3rd U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s284">The 7th Army started to have a war crimes program and finally was decided that all the facilities that were necessary were present down in Dachau, Germany which was the site of the concentration camp Dachau.</span> <span id="s285">And the war crimes program of 7th Army was folded over into what they called the War Crimes Group, whose headquarters was at Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">02:17:50</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q:We're going to have to change the tape again, so let's stop for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s289">03:00:02</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q:So let's get back to the judges.</span> <span id="s291">You were explaining who they were.</span> <span id="s292">There was one lawyer in this group, the rest of them weren't lawyers?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A:Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s294">All right.</span> <span id="s295">We'll start with</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q:You can answer the question.</span> <span id="s297">We're okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A:Okay.</span> <span id="s299">The personnel of this Military Government Courts, as I said, consisted of seven to nine individuals.</span> <span id="s300">One of whom was a law member.</span> <span id="s301">The balance of these individuals were career professional officers.</span> <span id="s302">They had usually had anywhere from 25 to 30 years of experience as being in the armed services of the United States.</span> <span id="s303">Were all, as I said, selected as men of stature and high moral character.</span> <span id="s304">And they were selected by Headquarters 3rd Army as the appointing authority.</span> <span id="s305">And were taken also, I might add, with the consensus of the headquarters of USTEF.</span> <span id="s306">That is European forces of the United States in Europe.</span> <span id="s307">And they were men who took their duties very seriously.</span> <span id="s308">They had all served as members of court marshals in the course of their careers as regular army officers.</span> <span id="s309">But the law that was given to them was given to them by the law member of that court, and there wasn't but one of those.</span> <span id="s310">The law member was the individual who advised the rest of the court as to the admissibility of evidence, for example.</span> <span id="s311">You couldn't have nine judges sitting up there and the question being asked down here and one member sayswhen the other side objects, one man says, one judge says sustained and the other one says overruled.</span> <span id="s312">So that was solely within the province of the law member.</span> <span id="s313">But the law that was applicable was international law.</span> <span id="s314">And they were charged with what was known as war crimes.</span> <span id="s315">And a war crime that these people were charged with were violation of the laws and usages of war.</span> <span id="s316">Now, theythat term, violation of the laws and usages of war, embodies the conventions that this country and Germany had entered into.</span> <span id="s317">And they, of course, were signatories to the Hague Convention of nineteen hundred and seven, and the Geneva Convention of nineteen hundred and twenty‑nine.</span> <span id="s318">And I might point out at this time that the war crime that we are talking about, violation of the laws and usages of war, included not only these conventions that I've just mentioned, but also they included the course of conduct of combatants in the past.</span> <span id="s319">There were a lot of customs and usages that had existed that were all embodied in the term laws and usages of war.</span> <span id="s320">You know, the conventions were taking place solely for the purpose of really making more civilized the practicing of war.</span> <span id="s321">And the Hague concerned itself with non combatants, and the Geneva Convention concerned itself with the conduct of combatants toward prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s322">And those were the two particulars that we had in each one of these charges that we had for these camps.</span> <span id="s323">That they violated the laws and usages of war in that pursuant to a common design to operate these camps to kill, to beat, to starve, these were the offenses that they were charged with.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q:The charge or the indictment of the crimes against humanity was not applicable?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">03:05:05</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A:No, sir, it was not.</span> <span id="s327">Thesethese violations that I prosecuted these accused for were just as much a part of their law as their statutes in Germany.</span> <span id="s328">So there was no retroactive effect of what we were doing here at Dachau at all.</span> <span id="s329">There were no new crimes that were established at Dachau.</span> <span id="s330">We tried them for what had been on the books for years and years.</span> <span id="s331">Nobody could get in there and say that this is ex post facto in what was carried on by the military government courts in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q:Do you think that was a problem in the other cases?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A:I don't think there's any doubt about it.</span> <span id="s334">There was some people that wouldn't have even dared touch them because of the feeling that they were ex post facto.</span> <span id="s335">Waging aggressive warfare.</span> <span id="s336">Every warfare is aggressive.</span> <span id="s337">The means by which you carry it out, that's something else again.</span> <span id="s338">But crimes against humanity, that's as broad as the world is big.</span> <span id="s339">But we had nothing indefinite about what we did at Dachau.</span> <span id="s340">I've been in a lot of arguments on this, so I don't want to get started.</span> <span id="s341">We could be here</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q:I'm curious, because there were three indictments that were possible in these war crimes trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q:Crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</span> <span id="s345">Crimes against humanity was the least used?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A:That's right.</span> <span id="s347">Because it was least known.</span> <span id="s348">It was the least recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q:And you agree to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A:I agree with that, sure.</span> <span id="s351">I really do.</span> <span id="s352">There'll come a day I'm sure as we become more civilized and conduct our wars in more civilized ways, where you got to let authority expand.</span> <span id="s353">And that takes in crimes against humanity.</span> <span id="s354">Because humanity, when you start defining it, is rather broad.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q:Whose idea was it to have these parent trials essentially?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A:Well, I think that was born of necessity more than anything else.</span> <span id="s357">You can't say that that was product of any one man's brain.</span> <span id="s358">The law chancellor of England participated in putting together the proper procedures so thatit was not an individual contribution of any one man.</span> <span id="s359">But it grew and has been growing and will always grow.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q:When you talked about the fact that the legal system that was used or the procedures that were used would be those used for American citizens, you're really, I think, talking about military?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A:I amI am indeed, except the constitutional rights.</span> <span id="s362">In other words, the constitutional rights that are guaranteed to every one of our citizens when he's confronted with being accused of a crime were afforded to these people.</span> <span id="s363">They had the right to counsel.</span> <span id="s364">They had the right to have witnesses.</span> <span id="s365">In Buchenwald we had a man by the name of Dr. Evan Katzenelenbogen who had some friends in France that he wantedin Paris that he wanted brought over to the trial at Dachau.</span> <span id="s366">We brought them over, but he didn't know that they had gotten here.</span> <span id="s367">And he got up and told the court that he had made this request and never been fulfilled at all, in one respect.</span> <span id="s368">And in another, that the witnesses were dead.</span> <span id="s369">That he is sorry to learn that the witnesses were dead.</span> <span id="s370">And we had them sitting out in the witness room.</span> <span id="s371">They were not dead at all.</span> <span id="s372">They were arrived.</span> <span id="s373">They came in and testified.</span> <span id="s374">Not too much for Dr. Katzenelenbogen.</span> <span id="s375">But they said what he wanted them to say, but they also said what also occurred in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q:You said that American attorneys could also be used by the accused?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A:Absolutely.</span> <span id="s378">They were.</span> <span id="s379">And they had not only American counsel, but also a German counsel as well.</span> <span id="s380">And when I told you that my status changed from being a colonel in the army to a civilian, I was what was known as a War Department civilian.</span> <span id="s381">And there were quite a number of Americans that were over there serving as defense counsel.</span> <span id="s382">And they had access to those as well and some of them also served as prosecutors.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q:Could the Americans decide whether they wanted to be a prosecutor or whether they wanted to be a defense attorney?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A:Well, I think basically they could.</span> <span id="s385">But moreit was more determined when the courts were organized, and when they wentwhen the courts were organized, the individuals that were named in as prosecutors or as defense counsel, they were selected from this pool of lawyers.</span> <span id="s386">And when they got in that pool, some of them preferred to be defense counsel, some of them preferred to be prosecutors.</span> <span id="s387">And I think that those facts were made known and were considered by the appointing authority.</span> <span id="s388">But the final say was the appointing authority which was General Truscott and later on General McNarney and General Clay.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q:Were there problems with American attorneys becoming defense attorneys for these accused?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A:None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s391">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q:Did Jewish lawyers have a particularwere they given particular dispensation not to have to defend if they didn't want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A:Oh, no.</span> <span id="s394">No, no.</span> <span id="s395">We had Jewish lawyers that acted both as prosecution and as defense.</span> <span id="s396">One of my counsel assistants in Dachau was very able young lawyer by the name of Paul Gooth (ph).</span> <span id="s397">Paul had been born in Vienna.</span> <span id="s398">And Paul was educated at Oxford and took his law at Columbia and was a very able lawyer.</span> <span id="s399">And a very young man at that time.</span> <span id="s400">And he was tremendous help to us in the preparation of the Dachau case and the Mauthausen case.</span> <span id="s401">He was superb, actually.</span> <span id="s402">And I point him out because of the fact that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s403">But he did take on the prosecutorial role.</span> <span id="s404">And his contributions were invaluable, really.</span> <span id="s405">And I had another one by the name of Berkowitz from Philadelphia; Camden/Philadelphia area.</span> <span id="s406">He was in the Flossenbürg case.</span> <span id="s407">He started out with Colonel Shaw, and Colonel Shaw became ill and I replaced Colonel Shaw.</span> <span id="s408">Mr. Berkowitz was a superb lawyer.</span> <span id="s409">And he did more to keep co‑counsel straight in the trial of Flossenbürg than anybody else there.</span> <span id="s410">And he did that by making us all remember that we owed a responsibility to these accused.</span> <span id="s411">And the responsibility we owed was to give them a fair trial.</span> <span id="s412">And that brings to mind the fact that when we were first called altogether in the Dachau case, which was the first one of these parent cases, the commanding general at that time was Lucien Truscott.</span> <span id="s413">And he called us all together and said he wanted us to be fair, but he wanted each one of us to be able to look back upon what we had done in the future and be proud of it.</span> <span id="s414">So that we should conduct ourselves in that way.</span> <span id="s415">And fairness was the first requirement.</span> <span id="s416">And with that as a send off, I thought it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s417">And that became a part of Mr. Berkowitz.</span> <span id="s418">And Mr. Berkowitz also wasmade contributions in procedure and knowledge of substantive law that we all appreciated.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q:When you're sitting in the courtroomlet's begin to talk about Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">03:15:10</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q:Tell me whatthis is your first set of trials.</span> <span id="s423">The first time you are confronting this information, confronting accused within this kind of a situation.</span> <span id="s424">What is this like?</span> <span id="s425">What happened during this trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A:Well, let me say this: At the time I started to try Dachau, I had tried literally hundreds of jury cases and bench trials.</span> <span id="s427">So the fact that this was a tribunal and I was appearing before them where the fact‑finders were in the majority like normally be in a jury, and the judge was a law member, it wasn't anything that was unusual.</span> <span id="s428">But the feeling that I had at that time was that I wanted to establish a record that would depict a true picture of what went on.</span> <span id="s429">And that these individuals accused over there, while they were essential cogs in the machine that the picture was of, the operation of the camp, that it was essential that each one of them be given an opportunity to do whatever he thought was within his power to acquit himself and any of his confederates, if you please.</span> <span id="s430">And I use that term confederates advisedly.</span> <span id="s431">But actually I had no qualms of conscience about wanting to hang any one of them.</span> <span id="s432">Because I had actually convinced myself to the point that I was perfectly willing to put the noose around the neck of each one of them with my own hand and spring the trap with my own hand.</span> <span id="s433">I was that convinced of their guilt.</span> <span id="s434">And so in mass, it was a mass of guilty individuals that should be put away.</span> <span id="s435">And that's the way I felt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s437">We're going to take a break now with another tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A:All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q:Let's stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">TAPE #4</span></p> <p><span id="s441">04:00:20</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q:Bill, could you describe the atmosphere at the Dachau trials and what that was like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A:Well, let me say this: That the courtroom had been one of the buildings in which operations in support of the war had taken place.</span> <span id="s444">True it is, they were making shoes and uniforms for the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s445">And they had the necessary machinery in there for sewing and mending and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s446">Well, when they decided to have these trials down in Dachau, they ripped out all the insides of this building that I just described so that there was one large room.</span> <span id="s447">And it was so large that it was the size of the whole building, which could have been 200‑250 feet long and maybe a hundred feet wide.</span> <span id="s448">And they made offices for the prosecution and offices for the defendants.</span> <span id="s449">And one end of theaccused in one end of the building, another end of the building was the courtroom.</span> <span id="s450">And at the far end was a dais that was raised about two feet off of the ground.</span> <span id="s451">So you had to take really two steps to get up to where you could stand.</span> <span id="s452">And there was a bench, you called it.</span> <span id="s453">What we calllawyers call bench.</span> <span id="s454">The judges' bench.</span> <span id="s455">It was his desk actually.</span> <span id="s456">It was a table that went practically the length of the room.</span> <span id="s457">And under which revolving chairs were placed.</span> <span id="s458">And it would seat up on the dais approximately as many as 12 to 13 people.</span> <span id="s459">So it was adequate.</span> <span id="s460">And being elevated, it was high enough to command respect.</span> <span id="s461">That's the whole idea of having the judge on the bench.</span> <span id="s462">And it was a dignified place.</span> <span id="s463">American flag was back on the wall which was behind the members of the court who were seated in front of it.</span> <span id="s464">And then in front of them there was the witness stand.</span> <span id="s465">And the witness stand was a single chair sort of like I'm sitting in here now.</span> <span id="s466">And that was placed in the middle.</span> <span id="s467">And about maybe 15 feet from where the members of the court sat, the accused sat either on the leftor the right‑hand side of the court as the court wanted.</span> <span id="s468">The accused had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s469">They occupied seats which were like seats in a theater that didn't have the upholstery.</span> <span id="s470">They were seatsseat of the seat folded up.</span> <span id="s471">And they sat onthe accused in Dachau sat on the court's left in that case.</span> <span id="s472">In Mauthausen they started out on the left and moved over to the right.</span> <span id="s473">I never asked who moved them, but I went in the court one day and it was that way, so that was it.</span> <span id="s474">And the accused each had their own separate seat.</span> <span id="s475">And in front of the bank of accused that was seated there were the counsel table for the accused.</span> <span id="s476">And there the lawyers and their assistants sat and took their notes and had their interpreters seated there with them.</span> <span id="s477">And getting back to the interpreters, the language barriers, they were not overcome there like they were at Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s478">We had no instantaneous translation.</span> <span id="s479">We hadthe trials were conducted in English and in German basically.</span> <span id="s480">So we had an English and German interpreter.</span> <span id="s481">Then if a witness, we will, say for example was Polish who spoke a little English and spoke no German, we would have an English‑Polish, German‑Polish interpreter.</span> <span id="s482">So that the order rather went this way: I as the prosecutor would ask the question in English.</span> <span id="s483">That was then translated by the English‑German interpreter into German.</span> <span id="s484">Then the Polish‑English interpreter would ask the question to the witness.</span> <span id="s485">Now, if the witness understood any of these languages, he could get sort of a fix on it.</span> <span id="s486">But we kept the language of the witness as the controlling language to this extent that he would then have less time for his reply.</span> <span id="s487">In other words, the interpreter who spoke Polish and German would translate after my English‑German interpreter had spoken, translated into Polish.</span> <span id="s488">Then the witness would answer in Polish, and it would come back the same track.</span> <span id="s489">So it was sometimes kind of confusing.</span> <span id="s490">But the court had the officialthese interpreters that I just described to you were all known as official interpreters.</span> <span id="s491">Then as a prosecutor I had my own interpreter and so did the defense counsel.</span> <span id="s492">So there was a bank of people.</span> <span id="s493">We were never without people.</span> <span id="s494">We always had enough accused for an audience at all times.</span> <span id="s495">But the rest of the seating in that covered enough rows there to seat approximately 250 to 300 attendees.</span> <span id="s496">And as I said, when we started out we had standing room only at sentencing.</span> <span id="s497">And when Nuremberg was not sitting, when Nuremberg finished there activities and our clients came back and visited us.</span> <span id="s498">And the attendees were basically in that only the families of the accused were there but also there were representatives of the different nationals that were involved.</span> <span id="s499">We had no Russian observers.</span> <span id="s500">We had no Polish observers, except the London Poles.</span> <span id="s501">The London Poles sent observers, and they were religious about attending all the trials.</span> <span id="s502">When Nuremberg finished, then the court reporters allthe newspaper reporters all came back and flocked in.</span> <span id="s503">And at that time they had been broadcasting these proceedings over the Munich radio station.</span> <span id="s504">And I must say, after they started broadcasting, business did pick up.</span> <span id="s505">We had a lot more attendees that wanted to see what they were hearing.</span> <span id="s506">Because some of it was still incredible to most of them, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s507">But when they saw the witnesses and heard them testify, they began to believe also.</span> <span id="s508">And the attitude, although I must say it was hard to determine, there never was any raucousness or any boisterous conduct of any kind.</span> <span id="s509">It was always carried out on a dignified plane.</span> <span id="s510">But sometimes there would be laughter at some activities that had occurred.</span> <span id="s511">And when some of the interpreters got fouled up, everybody was amused at that.</span> <span id="s512">But there was very little amusement other than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q:Did you ever talk to the citizens of Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A:Well, in the early cases there was fraternization ban which gradually was relaxed, if you please.</span> <span id="s515">And I talked to some of them.</span> <span id="s516">And some of them I talked to didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s517">Some of them I talked to thought that this was just a put-up job, and we were just trying to really administer victors' justice.</span> <span id="s518">But the broadcast did a lot to allay that.</span> <span id="s519">Because that brought them out.</span> <span id="s520">And then they could see, they could hear with their own ears and see with their own eyes what was transpiring there.</span> <span id="s521">And they could understand the German, which I couldn't.</span> <span id="s522">I listened to it enough.</span> <span id="s523">I learned "Gaschlopen" "Gestorben" and things like that.</span> <span id="s524">But I could speak very little German.</span> <span id="s525">I could tell when somebody was talking about me and that was about it.</span> <span id="s526">But when these people, particularly from Flossenbürg and in Buchenwald, we had standing room only in those trials practically every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q:Those were in the same courtroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A:The same courtroom, yes.</span> <span id="s529">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q:What was your impression of the accused?</span> <span id="s531">Did you interrogate them also?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A:Oh, in the very beginning, yes, we did.</span> <span id="s533">And then there was some feeling that maybe we were taking undue advantage by interrogating them.</span> <span id="s534">You know, in continental practice they have an interrogator that interrogates the accused and he has to answer questions.</span> <span id="s535">Well, these accused didn't have to answer questions.</span> <span id="s536">They were informed of the right that they didn't have to answer questions unless they wanted to.</span> <span id="s537">But in the beginning they were bragging about it.</span> <span id="s538">They would say, "Look,________, you killed X Y and Z here."</span> <span id="s539">He said, "X Y and Z plus."</span> <span id="s540">And he would tell us about other instances that he had really taken a man's life.</span> <span id="s541">And they were inother instance it was a braggadocio attitude.</span> <span id="s542">Because in the beginning these accused thought it was a game.</span> <span id="s543">And they really didn't appreciate the significance and the seriousness of it until after the trials got underway.</span> <span id="s544">And was it ever brought home when those who had been convicted in Dachau, and a lot of them were hanged there in April of 1946, end of March or April '46.</span> <span id="s545">A different attitude prevailed.</span> <span id="s546">They began to realize that these trials were for keeps.</span> <span id="s547">And it was up to them to defend themselves, if they had a defense.</span> <span id="s548">But in the beginning when you asked me did we interrogate them, yes, I interrogated them.</span> <span id="s549">And so did most of my assistants.</span> <span id="s550">In fact, I don't think I put a witness on the stand that I didn't interrogate.</span> <span id="s551">But I never put one of the accused on the stand because that wasn't my prerogative.</span> <span id="s552">They were free to take the stand if they wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q:But you could use the evidence that you gathered in the</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A:That's right.</span> <span id="s555">I could use that as prior inconsistent statement if it was inconsistent with what he said on the stand.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q:Did anybody ever contrite?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A:Nobody was evercontrition isI don't think is a word in the German language.</span> <span id="s558">There never was a single individual that said, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s559">I made a mistake.</span> <span id="s560">Have mercy on my soul."</span> <span id="s561">On the contrary.</span> <span id="s562">There was one man that I prosecuted in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s563">The name was August Haigrubel.</span> <span id="s564">Haigrubel was one of the Gauleiters of Austria.</span> <span id="s565">Wasn't but two, and he was one of them.</span> <span id="s566">And the scoundrel had a concentration camp of his own.</span> <span id="s567">His name kept coming up when we were preparing the Mauthausen trial, but nobody knew where he was.</span> <span id="s568">We didn't have them in custody at Dachau at all.</span> <span id="s569">We had, as I said, 3,500 of them, but he wasn't one of them.</span> <span id="s570">So I finally figured out that he may be at Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s571">So I called up Mr. Justice Jackson who was the chief counsel and chief prosecutor then.</span> <span id="s572">And asked him if he had a man by the name of August Haigrubel.</span> <span id="s573">And he did a little checking and came back on the phone and said yes, that they did.</span> <span id="s574">And I said, "Well, sir, if you can release him to me, I think I've got a very powerful case against him.</span> <span id="s575">And I can hang him as high as Haman."</span> <span id="s576">And he says, "Well, counsel, that's pretty high."</span> <span id="s577">And he released him to me and Haigrubel took his place as one of the accused along with the 60 others that I tried in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s578">But when he was on the stand, he was the most arrogant, contemptible, and contemptuous individual you ever ran into anywhere.</span> <span id="s579">And all I did was try to build up that attitude.</span> <span id="s580">I wanted that court to drink deeply at that well.</span> <span id="s581">And he filled the bill.</span> <span id="s582">He was sentenced to be hanged, and he was hanged.</span> <span id="s583">And it's been about 15 years ago at a party in New York I ran into an individual who witnessed his execution.</span> <span id="s584">And he said that as they put the noose around his neck, he said, "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s585">No contrition of any kind.</span> <span id="s586">A lot of the accused did ask forgiveness after they were walking up the steps to be hanged, but that's the only time.</span> <span id="s587">And it wasn't very many of those.</span> <span id="s588">Practically none.</span> <span id="s589">But never in the courtroom at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q:Would it have made a difference you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A:To me?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q:As a lawyer.</span> <span id="s593">I don't mean</span></p> <p><span id="s594">04:16:20</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A:As a lawyer, no.</span> <span id="s596">None.</span> <span id="s597">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q:What about the witnesses?</span> <span id="s599">Was this a difficultwas it difficult to get the right witnesses</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A:Well, it was a job.</span> <span id="s601">It was a job.</span> <span id="s602">Because we had witnesses from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s603">As a matter of fact, I was assigned a little DC‑3 to collect witnesses after we had located and identified them.</span> <span id="s604">And I have to tell you about going in Austria trying to get them out of Vienna.</span> <span id="s605">That was a job.</span> <span id="s606">But getting back to the identity of the witnesses.</span> <span id="s607">We first got it from the war crimes investigating teams.</span> <span id="s608">They were of a tremendous help to us.</span> <span id="s609">And I think maybe we ought to stop here for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s611">All right.</span> <span id="s612">Let's stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">TAPE #5</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q:We were taking about witnesses.</span> <span id="s615">You were searching for witnesses.</span> <span id="s616">You're okay?</span> <span id="s617">Bill, we ended with your starting to talk about your search for witnesses and what they were like for you and who you would choose.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s619">Well, we got our leads from the war crimes investigating teams.</span> <span id="s620">And recognizing we had to have witnesses that were credible and we had to have witnesses that were knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s621">Those were the two things that were fundamental: Credibility and knowledgeability.</span> <span id="s622">And we would take the information that we got from the war crimes teams and use that as springboards.</span> <span id="s623">And interrogating witnesses, we would go from one witness to another depending upon what sort of impression he would make on the court.</span> <span id="s624">We evaluated that.</span> <span id="s625">And he may have known of an event that had occurred that others who would have more credibility than he had.</span> <span id="s626">So we would look around for that.</span> <span id="s627">And in this search weI was allocated a DC‑3 in which to collect the witnesses from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s628">Of course, as you know, the inmates of these four concentration camps came from practically every spot in Europe.</span> <span id="s629">And so those were the sites of the witnesses.</span> <span id="s630">Because most of them that had homes to go home to went home.</span> <span id="s631">A lot of them remained in the D.P. camps; displaced persons camps.</span> <span id="s632">That was a fertile source for acquiring witnesses, also.</span> <span id="s633">But we would get these witnesses in, and they would tell us these stories.</span> <span id="s634">And we would make an evaluation as to their credibility and their knowledgeability.</span> <span id="s635">Best ones we kept.</span> <span id="s636">Of course, we couldn't run on forever.</span> <span id="s637">But we tried to get the best because we would listen to one and he would tell us about somebody else that knew the same thing.</span> <span id="s638">And we would try to track him down.</span> <span id="s639">And I'mI've got to tell you about a man that assisted us greatly in Vienna.</span> <span id="s640">His name was Kohl, K‑o‑h‑l.</span> <span id="s641">Mr. Kohl was a devout communist.</span> <span id="s642">I'm sure he was a communist when he was in the camp and probably was a communist, because of that he was put into the camp.</span> <span id="s643">But he had a mouth full of gold teeth.</span> <span id="s644">And the Germans had an affinity for gold wherever it was; and particularly for those prisoners who had gold teeth.</span> <span id="s645">So that many a man lost his life because he had gold teeth in his mouth.</span> <span id="s646">Well, when I met Mr. Kohl in the process of trying to get witnesses from Vienna for the Mauthausen trial, he opened his mouth and laughed and there was this expanse of gold teeth.</span> <span id="s647">Just like a sunburst.</span> <span id="s648">I said, "Mr. Kohl, how in heaven's name did you survive Mauthausen from nineteen hundred and thirty‑eight when you were incarcerated there until the liberation in nineteen hundred and forty‑five in April?"</span> <span id="s649">And he says, "Colonel, I never smiled.</span> <span id="s650">And when I ate, I never chewed with my mouth open."</span> <span id="s651">And he survived.</span> <span id="s652">So I'm sure that's what he did to survive.</span> <span id="s653">Because when he did smile, as I said, it was daybreak, and it was lovely.</span> <span id="s654">But getting witnesses out of Vienna was very hard.</span> <span id="s655">They had a staff judge advocate over in 7th Army there at Vienna that was opposed to our taking witnesses out of Vienna because Vienna was in the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s656">The only part of Vienna that we had access to was the principal part of the city, and Tulin (ph) Air Force Base.</span> <span id="s657">And that wasotherwise you had to go through the Russian zone from Augsburg to get down to Vienna.</span> <span id="s658">Well, the staff judge advocate there under General Mark Clark said, "You can't take these witness out of here.</span> <span id="s659">The Russians will claim that you're kidnapping them and taking them out of the Russian Zone."</span> <span id="s660">And I asked to see General Clark, and I went in and I spoke to him.</span> <span id="s661">And he was a very cooperative individual.</span> <span id="s662">He said, "Colonel, you don't have to take them all out at one time, do you?"</span> <span id="s663">And I said, "No, sir."</span> <span id="s664">And he said, "Will five at the most do?"</span> <span id="s665">And "Yes, sir," I said, "We can shuttle them back and forth from now on."</span> <span id="s666">We only had about 30 that we had to get out so it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s667">But we had that type of reticence that was really keeping us from preparing Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s668">Because Mauthausen was located on the Enns River near Linz, Austria.</span> <span id="s669">And most of those individuals who were the occupants of Mauthausen were Austrians.</span> <span id="s670">And they had come from around Vienna.</span> <span id="s671">As a matter of fact, they had the Chancellor of Austria, Kurt von Schuschniggwas a prisoner in Flossenbürg and in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s672">So it was terribly important to us to establish a liaison that we could work with to get these witnesses out.</span> <span id="s673">And Mister Kohl was the man that did it with his gold teeth.</span> <span id="s674">He had a card index there of addresses of the people, I'm sure all of them were communists.</span> <span id="s675">But Lord bless them.</span> <span id="s676">At that time, and I must confess, at that time I didn't know a communist from a Nazi, or anybody else.</span> <span id="s677">They were all individuals to me at that time.</span> <span id="s678">And they were trying to assist me in discharging my duties.</span> <span id="s679">So I was very happy to have Mr. Kohl come in and testify and exhibit his gold teeth at the trial.</span> <span id="s680">Although I must say, it shook his credibility a little bit.</span> <span id="s681">But when he pressed his lips over his teeth, it made quite an impression on the court.</span> <span id="s682">And they were human beings, the courts were.</span> <span id="s683">They had a reason to believe that Mr. Kohl was telling the truth and that he did keep his mouth shut.</span> <span id="s684">And it was something that was terribly impressive to me that an individual could control his muscles to the extent thatI guess when your life is involved, you can do many things.</span> <span id="s685">And Kohl did it.</span> <span id="s686">Well, I guess I was wandering here about the witnesses that we had, and the problems that we had.</span> <span id="s687">I guess Vienna posed the most serious problem because most of the witnesses that knew the most were from that area around Linz and Vienna.</span> <span id="s688">Now, we did get a lot of witnesses out of the D.P. camps.</span> <span id="s689">Because those are the people that had no homes to go back to.</span> <span id="s690">They had been bombed out.</span> <span id="s691">Or their families had all been destroyed in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s692">They had no place to go.</span> <span id="s693">So they were in these camps.</span> <span id="s694">And we took those people.</span> <span id="s695">And those that could make the best impression so far as credibility and knowledgeability were the ones that we used to make our cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q:Can I ask you to describe what credibility and knowledgeability meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s698">Credibility involves many things.</span> <span id="s699">The way that you sit in your chair on the witness stand, your demeanor on the witness stand.</span> <span id="s700">How you express yourself.</span> <span id="s701">Even though it may be in a foreign language, the facial expressions that you utilize when you're expressing yourself.</span> <span id="s702">All these things go to the matter of being able to enable the fact‑finders to tell where the truth lies.</span> <span id="s703">If you get an individual that's going to be close-mouthed and going to tell you only those facts that advance his interest, you can tell it.</span> <span id="s704">It comes out.</span> <span id="s705">And that's the reason why credibility is a matter for the fact‑finder and never a consideration for the appellate authority, or in our case, the appointing and confirming authorities.</span> <span id="s706">Oh, I could tell you a lot about that if you want to talk about Ilse Koch sometime.</span> <span id="s707">But credibility is terribly important.</span> <span id="s708">And it was important because we had bizarre things that we had to get the court to believe.</span> <span id="s709">And if you had had a closed‑mouthed individual there talking about, describing event that I previously described to you, nobody is going to believe it.</span> <span id="s710">But if he got up there and said it with the feeling that it was terrible for him to even have to talk about it again, to recall it, it's bound to make an impression so far as a fact‑finder is concerned.</span> <span id="s711">That's what I mean about credibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q:Did you have people who were reluctant to be witnesses because they were frightened or they didn't want to reveal again what--</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A:Well, the only reluctance I think they had was recalling again the experiences that they had endured.</span> <span id="s714">I don't think anybody was afraid to testify.</span> <span id="s715">I don't think there was any coercion of any kind of character, either pro or con in that area.</span> <span id="s716">But I think that to recall some of the experiences that they had endured, it was terribly hard.</span> <span id="s717">I had one man testify by the name of Arthur Haulot.</span> <span id="s718">He was the minister from Belgium.</span> <span id="s719">Not a preaching minister, but a minister of state from Belgium.</span> <span id="s720">And he had been snatched away from Brussels and put into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s721">And he was a learned individual.</span> <span id="s722">Dignified man.</span> <span id="s723">And one night while he was in the concentration camp, I think it was in Dachau that he was incarcerated in, he was so hungry he couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s724">And that had occurred not once but many times.</span> <span id="s725">But this time it was terribly painful for him.</span> <span id="s726">And he remembered a crust of bread that his fellow prisoner had tucked under his arm to safeguard and eat it at some time.</span> <span id="s727">And he found himself easingstealing, if you pleasethat piece of bread from his fellow prisoner.</span> <span id="s728">And he took it back to his bunk.</span> <span id="s729">And then he started to cry.</span> <span id="s730">To think that he had sunk so low due to the treatment that he had been receiving there at Dachau, that he would steal from his fellow prisoner, who probably needed it just as badly, if not worse than he did.</span> <span id="s731">Well, needless to say, that crust of bread found its way back to his fellow prisoner.</span> <span id="s732">Well, when Brother Halleau delivered himself of that testimony on the stand, you could have heard a pin drop in that courtroom.</span> <span id="s733">Everybody was quiet.</span> <span id="s734">And they were moved by it.</span> <span id="s735">I was moved by it.</span> <span id="s736">And I think all the judges were moved by it.</span> <span id="s737">But that was the type of witness that are few and far between.</span> <span id="s738">But I say few and far between.</span> <span id="s739">Few is the wrong word.</span> <span id="s740">There were multitudes of them.</span> <span id="s741">But not all of them did we have access to.</span> <span id="s742">So they were jewels when we found witnesses like that.</span> <span id="s743">Another one was the name of Yoe-Thomas He was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s744">A very interesting individual.</span> <span id="s745">And he has since written a book entitled The White Rabbit, which you might get and read.</span> <span id="s746">It was his experiences in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s747">And how his life was saved by a male nurse that I prosecuted when I tried Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s748">The male nurse's name was Dietzsh.</span> <span id="s749">But to make a long story real short here: Dietzsh ran the typhus ward in Buchenwald where they were trying to develop a specific typhus like they were trying to develop one for malaria down at Dachau.</span> <span id="s750">And the guinea pigs were the prisoners, and they were dying right and left.</span> <span id="s751">And Yoe-Thomas had served as a liaison between Churchill and DeGaulle.</span> <span id="s752">And he was in the underground.</span> <span id="s753">And he couldn't spend two successive nights in Paris in the same place.</span> <span id="s754">The Gestapo were close after him.</span> <span id="s755">They finally caught him and they boxed him up and sent him off to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s756">Broke all his fingers.</span> <span id="s757">Pulled his fingernails out.</span> <span id="s758">Everything you can think of to torture him.</span> <span id="s759">He wouldn't talk.</span> <span id="s760">And he was sent there with some 20‑odd other Britons and Frenchmen.</span> <span id="s761">They had been collected by the Gestapo as being part of the French underground.</span> <span id="s762">And they were destined to be executed.</span> <span id="s763">So Thomas was a wing commander in the air force of the British.</span> <span id="s764">He was an organizer himself.</span> <span id="s765">And he went to work right away to try to protect his comrades that had been sent to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s766">Not Mauthausen, but Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s767">And they were beginning to get down to where the 20 had gotten down to possibly a half a dozen or more.</span> <span id="s768">And something drastic had to be done.</span> <span id="s769">And he talked to Dietzsh who was a prisoner, this male nurse.</span> <span id="s770">And made a deal with Dietzsh to try to get some of these remaining individuals into this sick block they had there with typhus being treated, and protect them that way.</span> <span id="s771">And they were changing identities.</span> <span id="s772">Well, one of the prisoners whose identity had matched one of these six men was changed and was just about to die.</span> <span id="s773">And he died, and he was able to swap identity and became a prisoner.</span> <span id="s774">Well, it finally got down to poor Yoe-Thomas.</span> <span id="s775">And they found out that Yoe-Thomas was in there, and they said, "Well, bring him out.</span> <span id="s776">We're going to get rid of him."</span> <span id="s777">And the way they had hanged the other, they didn't hang them by breaking the neck.</span> <span id="s778">They strangled them to death.</span> <span id="s779">The meat hooks that you see in a market with the slab of meat on it, those were in the crematory at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s780">And they would take one of these prisoners and hang him up by the neck until he strangled to death.</span> <span id="s781">And that was the thing that Yoe-Thomas had to look forward to.</span> <span id="s782">Well, Dietch told the S.S. man who came there to bring Thomas out.</span> <span id="s783">"Sure.</span> <span id="s784">He's got typhus.</span> <span id="s785">You can have him.</span> <span id="s786">He's got a fever of about 103.</span> <span id="s787">That if you can take him out, he's yours.</span> <span id="s788">But you may get typhus if you go in there and get him."</span> <span id="s789">He saidand Dietzsh says, "Why don't I just stick him with a syringe and execute him here?</span> <span id="s790">And you can go back and tell the commandant that he's dead and you saw him and he's dead."</span> <span id="s791">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s792">And Yoe Thomas later was buried.</span> <span id="s793">He was taken out as a corpse.</span> <span id="s794">And as soon as he got out of sight, he got alive again and got out of the camp and escaped, and was picked up by the Russians and they sent him back to the Germans on the exchange of prisoner.</span> <span id="s795">But he lived to tell the tale and wrote a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q:We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">TAPE #6</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q:Continue the story about the male nurse Dietzsh who saved</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A:Yes, I would like to do that.</span> <span id="s800">Because Arthur Dietzsh had been persecuted by the Weimar Republic and was persecuted again by Hitler.</span> <span id="s801">So he had spent most of his life in confinement of one form or another.</span> <span id="s802">And at Buchenwald he became the male nurse because he was a man of education that he had educated himself actually.</span> <span id="s803">And as a male nurse he was an assistant to a Sturmbahnführer, I think they call him.</span> <span id="s804">A Major Ding-Schuler, who was Kraut that had some artistic qualities about him.</span> <span id="s805">And he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s806">He had M.D. And had specialized in diseases and immunization.</span> <span id="s807">And they put Ding-Schuler in charge of this block which they had set aside as a hospital block for the purpose of developing some sort of immunization against typhus.</span> <span id="s808">Typhus was the plague that was raging all the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s809">I think it started up in Russia, and Treblinka actually is I think where they had the first cases of typhus, and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s810">And as those people spread down south, was sent.</span> <span id="s811">But when the advances forced them out of the camps, they spread it to the German concentration camps that were located in Germany and in Austria.</span> <span id="s812">So it was terribly important to get some sort of specific for typhus.</span> <span id="s813">And that was Ding-Schuler's job.</span> <span id="s814">And he selected this male nurse as Arthur Dietzsh as his assistant.</span> <span id="s815">And he educated Dietzsh, who already was educated in other matters.</span> <span id="s816">But he became a very confidantemuch of a confidante of Ding- Schuler's.</span> <span id="s817">And they talked about what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s818">And how Germany was losing the war.</span> <span id="s819">And they each recognized at that time, and this was back in January, February and March of 1945, handwriting was pretty much on the wall.</span> <span id="s820">And Arthur Dietzsh having access to Ding-Schuler, and Yoe-Thomas got himself in the typhus block and got access to Ding-Schuler and convinced Ding-Schuler to go along with his scheme.</span> <span id="s821">And that included Arthur Dietzsh as the male nurse.</span> <span id="s822">Because Arthur Dietzsh was a hands‑on person in the block.</span> <span id="s823">And they conceived this plan of taking some of these poor guinea pig prisoners who had been infected with typhus when they were dying, switching their identity with Yoe-Thomas and his friends, those five British‑French friends that remained out of the group that came there originally.</span> <span id="s824">And one by one they were able to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s825">They finally got down to Yoe-Thomas, and his twin hadn't died yet.</span> <span id="s826">So it was getting close.</span> <span id="s827">And they were asking to have Yoe-Thomas brought to the crematory for execution.</span> <span id="s828">As a matter of fact, they sent an Unterscharfführer, I think was tech sergeant or something, down to the hospital to escort Yoe-Thomas down to the crematory.</span> <span id="s829">And Ding-Schuler said, "Look, typhus is a pretty contagious disease.</span> <span id="s830">If you want to go in here and pick him out of this bed, he's yours.</span> <span id="s831">Be my guest."</span> <span id="s832">And the Unterscharfführer said he had a wife and some kids at home and he would like to avoid that if he could.</span> <span id="s833">And he saidI mean Dietzsh said, "All right.</span> <span id="s834">I'll kill him.</span> <span id="s835">I'll inject him with the syringe and you can take him out."</span> <span id="s836">Well, they finally had a man who was his double.</span> <span id="s837">He died.</span> <span id="s838">And this is according to Dietzsh, believe it or not, but he died.</span> <span id="s839">And Dietzsh went to this corpse, injected it with hydrogen peroxide of all things.</span> <span id="s840">That gets into the heart and creates an embolism, and death is pretty certain.</span> <span id="s841">And speedy.</span> <span id="s842">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s843">So they said, "Now you can tell them that he's dead.</span> <span id="s844">And if you want to, you can take the body back."</span> <span id="s845">And they said, "No.</span> <span id="s846">You just assure me that he's dead.</span> <span id="s847">Let me take a look."</span> <span id="s848">He took a look and he didn't know Yoe-Thomas from Adam's house cat.</span> <span id="s849">But he went back and reported he was dead.</span> <span id="s850">Well, that saved Yoe-Thomas' life.</span> <span id="s851">And Thomas wrote out on a slip of paper, "To Whom It May Concern, that this man, Labaro (ph), Arthur Dietzsh has saved my life.</span> <span id="s852">And any consideration that you can give him when he's brought to trial" because Yoe- Thomas had told him every one of you going to be brought to trial.</span> <span id="s853">All of them.</span> <span id="s854">That's how he had his entree to Ding- Schuler.</span> <span id="s855">And he gave him this slip of paper.</span> <span id="s856">And Arthur Dietzsh saved his life.</span> <span id="s857">But he didn't save it for long in that sense.</span> <span id="s858">He went out the back door as a corpse, was turned over to the Russians who picked him up on an exchange of prisoners.</span> <span id="s859">And he was then sent back to the Germans on this exchange by the Russians.</span> <span id="s860">He escaped a second time but not from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s861">However, the one thing I want to say about Dietzsh, when he did this, he did it because I think in his heart and soul he knew that this is a man that deserves saving.</span> <span id="s862">They had had a lot of conversations together, Dietzsh and Yoe-Thomas.</span> <span id="s863">And Ding-Schuler and Yoe-Thomas.</span> <span id="s864">So that he had the cooperationDietzsh had the cooperation of his boss.</span> <span id="s865">And Yoe-Thomas was the boss of both Schuler and Arthur Dietzsh.</span> <span id="s866">The court that tried Dietzsh gave him ten years.</span> <span id="s867">And I think the reviewing authority cut it down to time that he had spent in confinement.</span> <span id="s868">Ding-Schuler took his own life when Buchenwald fell.</span> <span id="s869">Ding-Schuler committed suicide.</span> <span id="s870">So I think that Ding-Schuler is a little different from the ilk that ran the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s871">He was able to be persuaded by Yoe-Thomas.</span> <span id="s872">Now, that didn't happen very frequently.</span> <span id="s873">Because there were a lot of others that had tried substantially the same approach that were not successful.</span> <span id="s874">In Buchenwald we had some other interesting characters one of whom was Ilse Koch, who was the wife of a former commandant.</span> <span id="s875">She was not the wife of a commandant that was there when the camp failed.</span> <span id="s876">Pista (ph) was the man on trial.</span> <span id="s877">And Pista couldn't stand Ilse Koch because she still was the commandeur, according to her, of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s878">And they were somewhat at odds.</span> <span id="s879">Well, Ilse Koch had a fancy for light shades.</span> <span id="s880">I didn't try her for that.</span> <span id="s881">I tried her for aiding and abetting the operation of the Buchenwald concentration camp.</span> <span id="s882">She, during the time of her husband, when he was commandant, used to report prisoners because they ogled her.</span> <span id="s883">I think that's the way you pronounce it when you make big eyes at tight‑fitting clothes on a very voluptuous body.</span> <span id="s884">And whenever prisoners ogled Ilse, she took down their numbers.</span> <span id="s885">They were reported and they were whipped.</span> <span id="s886">And they were whipped in a way which was absolutely inhuman.</span> <span id="s887">They were spread across a desk with hands out in front of them and legs down.</span> <span id="s888">And they had to count in German each blow that was administered.</span> <span id="s889">And when they were directed to receive 25 blows, they had to count them out loud.</span> <span id="s890">And they had to count each blow in German.</span> <span id="s891">Well, some of those Poles couldn't speak German.</span> <span id="s892">And some of the Frenchmen couldn't speak German.</span> <span id="s893">And many times those beatings led to death.</span> <span id="s894">So she did have her share of participation in the operation of that camp and in furthering the operation of the camp to the extent that there was this common design to subject these prisoners to that type of punishment and that type of misconduct of starvation.</span> <span id="s895">All that sort of thing were things that were charged in the charge sheet.</span> <span id="s896">So she was guilty of aiding and abetting the operation of that camp.</span> <span id="s897">Once she had been found guilty, she was given a life sentence.</span> <span id="s898">And the only reason why I later found out from a member of the court that they didn't hang her was that she was carrying a child.</span> <span id="s899">She was four months pregnant at the time she was sentenced.</span> <span id="s900">Well, when the reviewing authority cut her sentence down from life imprisonment to four years, they gave as an excuse that there was insufficient credible evidence to justify a sentence of that severity.</span> <span id="s901">Well, remember, credibility is for the fact‑finder, not for the man who is reviewing the case.</span> <span id="s902">Because the man who sees that witness testify and observes the demeanor on the stand, he knows where the truth is coming from.</span> <span id="s903">Not the man who has the written page in front of him of the record of the trial that the original court had made.</span> <span id="s904">Well, that produced a flurry when they reduced the sentence.</span> <span id="s905">I objected to it.</span> <span id="s906">And I objected to it on the ground that I had tried four of these casesthree at that time; that was the fourth case.</span> <span id="s907">And I thought I knew how to try a concentration camp case.</span> <span id="s908">Well, when they said there was insufficient credible evidence, that they were telling me I didn't know what was credible and what wasn't.</span> <span id="s909">So I wrote a letter pointing out these things.</span> <span id="s910">And the Congress of the United States took over after that.</span> <span id="s911">The committee in the Senate headed by Homer Ferguson held hearings from September of '48 until Christmas.</span> <span id="s912">And they decided that I was right; that there was sufficient credible evidence.</span> <span id="s913">But since the reviewing authority had said no, four years is all, there's nothing we can do about it.</span> <span id="s914">Well, the things that they did do about it, they turned them over to the German people who tried her for offenses against Germans.</span> <span id="s915">I had not tried her for offenses against Germans.</span> <span id="s916">And they tried her and she was given another life sentence and committed suicide in prison.</span> <span id="s917">Buchenwald was full of interesting people.</span> <span id="s918">The accused I'm talking about.</span> <span id="s919">I'm sure there were a lot more interesting people who were also prisoners like Yoe-Thomas and others.</span> <span id="s920">One that I tried was a doctor by the name of Evan Katzenelenbogen.</span> <span id="s921">He was a doctor in the small camp.</span> <span id="s922">And he sold his services to the prisoners for anything that he can get out of them.</span> <span id="s923">And on occasions he would snatch prisoners out from the upper bunk.</span> <span id="s924">And they lived in these bunks, and in a bunk there were five men to a bunk that was to accommodate one and at most two.</span> <span id="s925">Well, this one time he was in; and this had not happened not just one time but many times.</span> <span id="s926">He would snatch a man off of the top bunk down to the floor, which was about six feet below.</span> <span id="s927">And very frequently the prisoner would die as a result of skull fracture.</span> <span id="s928">That, plus the fact that he was selling his services to the people that he was supposed to protect and take care of, moved us to include him as one of the accused.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q:What do you mean by selling his services?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A:Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q:What do you mean by selling his services?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A:He wouldn't treat them unless they gave him part of the Red Cross packages that they had gotten a hold of.</span> <span id="s933">That's where he sold his services.</span> <span id="s934">And to me that was a heinous offense in itself.</span> <span id="s935">Well, we put him on trial.</span> <span id="s936">He had originally been an American citizen.</span> <span id="s937">He married the daughter of one of the judges of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s938">They had a child who fell out of a window and died, and Katzenelenbogen went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s939">Katzenelenbogen was really a psychoanalyst and a devout student of Freud.</span> <span id="s940">And did his job well.</span> <span id="s941">Maybe we should continue just a little bit on this a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s943">You want to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A:Well, I mean, I thought</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q:Okay.</span> <span id="s946">We can stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">TAPE #7</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q:You want to continue talking about Katzenelenbogen?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A:Katzenelenbogen was a psychoanalyst.</span> <span id="s950">And he played his trade to the last inch in defense of his own self.</span> <span id="s951">That court absolutely detested him because of the evidence that had been amassed against him.</span> <span id="s952">And it was very little that he did to defend himself other than still claim American citizenship.</span> <span id="s953">Because he had come to this country when he was about 20 or 21 years of age, and was still in school.</span> <span id="s954">And had taken citizenship papers and married a daughter of one of the justices on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s955">They had a child, and the child fell out of an apartment window in New York and was killed.</span> <span id="s956">And that broke up the family.</span> <span id="s957">He went back to Germany and toactually it wasn't Germany.</span> <span id="s958">It was that section of the Austrian‑Hungarian Empire that was in there between Germany and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s959">Actually went back to Marienbad and opened a clinic there.</span> <span id="s960">And the Gestapo got interested in him as an informer.</span> <span id="s961">And he was an informer.</span> <span id="s962">And finally he ended up in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s963">And they put him in the small camp as a doctor.</span> <span id="s964">And I told you he was sort of a mean fella.</span> <span id="s965">And he would sell his services rather than perform what he was supposed to do.</span> <span id="s966">And he came on for trial having committed a war crime.</span> <span id="s967">And he more or less made an ass out of himself before the court in his responses to the questions that were asked by his defense counsel.</span> <span id="s968">And his defense counsel, I believe, at that time was a man by the name of Wolff (ph).</span> <span id="s969">And Wolf did the best he could to keep Katzenelenbogen quiet.</span> <span id="s970">Because the more he talked, the worse he got.</span> <span id="s971">And when I had him on cross‑examination, of course I did the best I could to let him tell us everything he knew.</span> <span id="s972">And he knew a lot.</span> <span id="s973">As a matter of fact, he said the evidence was such that he could have the then minister of justice in France sitting in his seat for the activities that that minister had performed in the small camp at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s974">Well, we let him talk.</span> <span id="s975">And after it was over, the court first called him forward and announced that he had been found guilty.</span> <span id="s976">Well, Katzenelenbogen was asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him.</span> <span id="s977">And he had this deep voice.</span> <span id="s978">He could have been a basso profunda at the Met With no trouble at all.</span> <span id="s979">He said, "Now that this honorable court has put the Mark of Cain upon my brow, I have but one wish.</span> <span id="s980">And that is that this court impose upon me the most serious punishment within its power."</span> <span id="s981">And he nodded like that.</span> <span id="s982">And I thought to myself, Well, bless his heart.</span> <span id="s983">I hope they accommodate him.</span> <span id="s984">Well, there was a flurry behind on the bench.</span> <span id="s985">And the president of the court said, "The court finds pursuant to your plea of not guilty that you are guilty.</span> <span id="s986">And finding of you being guilty chooses to impose upon you a life imprisonment."</span> <span id="s987">So the old scoundrel didn't get hanged at all.</span> <span id="s988">He got off with his life.</span> <span id="s989">And except for his age, he'd be alive today.</span> <span id="s990">But he played it to the last inch.</span> <span id="s991">That court, I found out, that, they didn't want to please him.</span> <span id="s992">And he had asked for the death sentence, and rather than please him, they gave him life imprisonment instead.</span> <span id="s993">So he was a doctor to the end.</span> <span id="s994">I must say that I get back to reducing sentences.</span> <span id="s995">Clemency is a proper thing to be exercised under proper conditions.</span> <span id="s996">But there was no clemency that Ilse Koch was entitled to.</span> <span id="s997">There was no clemency that Katzenelenbogen was entitled to, in my judgment.</span> <span id="s998">But I didn't have the power to wield that authority.</span> <span id="s999">And the fact that some of these sentences have been reduced, I go back to the feeling that I do not know all the facts and circumstances about their family relationships, whether or not they're the sole supports of families that then existed, who were probably without fault on their part.</span> <span id="s1000">So that there could be many considerations that could justify the reduction of sentences.</span> <span id="s1001">And in the main, I find no fault with the exercise of clemency when it's denominated clemency.</span> <span id="s1002">But I do object like a stuck pig to any time that they start reducing sentences on the grounds of insufficient credible evidence, for the simple reason that the whole operation was incredible in its entirety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q:When you look at the entire set of trials that were, not just the ones you were participating in, where so many people had harsh sentences, whether it was death or life imprisonment that were severely reduced or they were let go, does that bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A:To let go, again, I don't know the circumstances of their letting go.</span> <span id="s1005">That's a function of the exercise of clemency.</span> <span id="s1006">It's to take into consideration those factors which were no part of my concern.</span> <span id="s1007">So that if I knew that a sentence had been reduced in exercise of clemency, I don't quarrel with it.</span> <span id="s1008">If it's exercised on the ground of insufficient credible evidence, I scream.</span> <span id="s1009">And I scream loud and long, because I know that's wrong.</span> <span id="s1010">And I know that's wrong because I know that these events that seem incredible to the person who reads about them happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q:Do you think there's a different political set of circumstances in 1945 versus 1948 when the trials are going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A:I'm sure that there may very well have been, sure.</span> <span id="s1013">Germany was sickened to find denazified leaders.</span> <span id="s1014">While none of these individuals that I tried could hardly make that category, there was a sense of uncertainty in not knowing which way to go.</span> <span id="s1015">And I think this: I think the United States government did a magnificent job in its occupation.</span> <span id="s1016">I really do.</span> <span id="s1017">And I say they're entitled to all credit for that.</span> <span id="s1018">And I think while mistakes were made, to err is human, to forgive divine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q:Tell me, were there security arrangements for you and the other lawyers during these trials that you know about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A:No.</span> <span id="s1021">We had guards there, sure.</span> <span id="s1022">But when you talk about security arrangements, I'll assume that you're talking about somebody that's going to follow me around and be sure that somebody is not going to take a shot at me when I'm out hunting or fishing, if I did in what little spare time I had.</span> <span id="s1023">But there wasn't anyone that tailed us to protect us.</span> <span id="s1024">No.</span> <span id="s1025">Nothing like that.</span> <span id="s1026">There was always a number of Polish guards that were there in that courtroom all the time.</span> <span id="s1027">You seen the white hats at Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1028">Well, the Poles wore white hats at our trial, in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1029">And they were kept on a constant surveillance by the Polish guards that we had there, as well as American guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q:Did these trials take a physical and psychological toll on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A:Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s1032">At one time they recessed the court because they said I looked more like an exhibit out of the concentration camp than anybody I'd put on the stand.</span> <span id="s1033">The trousers that I wore I could fold over behind with no problem at all.</span> <span id="s1034">I was glad to lose that.</span> <span id="s1035">But the shirts that I was wearing at that time, somebody else could get in the neck with me.</span> <span id="s1036">And my clothes didn't fit.</span> <span id="s1037">I lostI got down to 117 pounds.</span> <span id="s1038">And I weighed normally about 155 to 165 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q:So what was your day like?</span> <span id="s1040">And what were you working; 12, 15 hours days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A:I was working like that and sleeping less at night.</span> <span id="s1042">Because I was thinkingI had nightmares.</span> <span id="s1043">I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1044">TheseI was reliving some of these experiences myself.</span> <span id="s1045">What would I be doing under those circumstances?</span> <span id="s1046">How would I react to this?</span> <span id="s1047">It took a toll.</span> <span id="s1048">Well, after I finished Flossenbürg, Flossenbürg was the longest trial because I had been prepared in a way differently from the way I prepared cases being prepared by Colonel Shaw.</span> <span id="s1049">And at the end of January I was ready to go home.</span> <span id="s1050">This was January of '47.</span> <span id="s1051">And I went to bed and I stayed in bed for two weeks.</span> <span id="s1052">And I'd get up for meals and that was about it.</span> <span id="s1053">And the war crimes branch representatives came down from Wiesbaden and said they got another job that they'd like for me to do.</span> <span id="s1054">They'd give me my choice: That I could either prosecute Scorzeni (ph).</span> <span id="s1055">Scorzeni was a man who kidnapped Mussolini and had previously kidnapped Admiral Horthy from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1056">And I said, "Shoot.</span> <span id="s1057">We shouldn't try him; I think we ought to hire him."</span> <span id="s1058">So I didn't.</span> <span id="s1059">They said, "Well, the other job is to prosecute Buchenwald."</span> <span id="s1060">And I thought, I could try that like falling off a log and nothing to it.</span> <span id="s1061">I had tried three cases, and that would be less strain on me.</span> <span id="s1062">But that lasted from April to the end of August of '47.</span> <span id="s1063">That's when I finished that case.</span> <span id="s1064">But that was an interesting case.</span> <span id="s1065">That had a lot of different things that were of interest.</span> <span id="s1066">Of course it could never be interesting to the people that were prisoners in it.</span> <span id="s1067">But it had different aspects.</span> <span id="s1068">In Buchenwald they had quite a number of projects going there in the surrounding areas, at the sub‑camps, all of which were interesting.</span> <span id="s1069">And each one of these sub‑camps were operated largely like the main camp.</span> <span id="s1070">And some of them were much worse the Kaufering and Landsberg camps as sub‑camps of Dachau was so much worse than the main camp that they were not in the same ballpark at all.</span> <span id="s1071">Actually they had classifications.</span> <span id="s1072">Dachau was a Class 1 camp.</span> <span id="s1073">Mauthausen was a Class 3 camp.</span> <span id="s1074">That was an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1075">Whenever prisoners got to the point where they couldn't work enough to earn their keep of black coffee and no cream, no sugar, no fats of any kind, and black bread down through the grams that they were being fedit sort of strains me to try to reconstruct these things.</span> <span id="s1076">I start thinking about what they had to eat.</span> <span id="s1077">Of course the camps claim that they were being fedthe prisoners were being fed the same rations that the German populace were feeding.</span> <span id="s1078">That was correct as to the quantity in this sense, not the quality nor by calorie.</span> <span id="s1079">By calorie count it was nowhere near.</span> <span id="s1080">These men were working all day long, not able to sleep at night, and being fed less than a thousand calories a day.</span> <span id="s1081">Well, the same thing was happening to me to a large extent.</span> <span id="s1082">And that's why I got so gaunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q:Were there breaks?</span> <span id="s1084">It sounds to me as if you were, for the most part, going trial to trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A:Well, for the most part I had.</span> <span id="s1086">I went from trial to trial because I had to prepare the next trial.</span> <span id="s1087">After I finishedI finished Dachau the 15th of December of '45.</span> <span id="s1088">I started almost immediately working on Mauthausen, when I could physically work.</span> <span id="s1089">But that took a lot out of me; Dachau did.</span> <span id="s1090">Because that was a new experience and one that I wasn't adjusted to.</span> <span id="s1091">As I tried these cases, I got more adjusted.</span> <span id="s1092">And I worked on Dachau along with my assistants.</span> <span id="s1093">And I had five very able men there to all do--Paul Gooth (ph) I kept on, and had four other lawyers there that were very able men.</span> <span id="s1094">And I can't remember now all their names, but I don't want to mention anyone without doing an injustice to the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q:When you got so sick and so gaunt and had all these nightmares, did you want to stop and not hear this anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A:I had to stop when we had the recess in Flossenbürg, that was basically the reason why they stopped, because I couldn't go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q:Did other lawyers respond similarly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A:Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1099">Sure.</span> <span id="s1100">I mean, they were affected the same way.</span> <span id="s1101">But it was a nervous strain.</span> <span id="s1102">It was basically my responsibility.</span> <span id="s1103">And it was one that I didn't welcome, but it was one that I had.</span> <span id="s1104">And I knew that I had to discharge it.</span> <span id="s1105">And I had to discharge it in a way that was expected it to be discharged.</span> <span id="s1106">And that's what I tried to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q:Earlier you said you wanted to talk about Kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A:Oh, Kapos.</span> <span id="s1109">Kapos were prisoners in the camp.</span> <span id="s1110">And they werehad been the main criminals.</span> <span id="s1111">They were penitentiary individuals that had served their sentences there but were still considered by the Germans to be hazard politically.</span> <span id="s1112">So they put these poor German criminals into Dachau and made Kapos out of them.</span> <span id="s1113">Well, a lot of themthese Kapos were also in there for rape, arson, murder, and violent crimes.</span> <span id="s1114">And a lot of them had that same mentality when they were put in the position of Kapo.</span> <span id="s1115">And a Kapo in the concentration camp was like a foreman of a work gang, with this important exception: they not only had to say what they told them to say and do what they were told to do, but if they didn't, he had the power of life and death over the people in his detail.</span> <span id="s1116">So they did what he said.</span> <span id="s1117">And for that reason, the Kapos, prisoners themselves, turned out to be meaner to the political prisoners and the others that were there.</span> <span id="s1118">And particularly the Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s1119">All the Kaposthey put a Kapo by the name of Wolf in charge of the punishment detail in Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q:Let's hold it because I have to change the tape and we'll go back to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">TAPE #8</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q:All right.</span> <span id="s1123">You were talking about Mr. Wolf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A:Mr. Wolf was a criminal prisoner.</span> <span id="s1125">And he was given charge of what was known as the punishment detail in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1126">Mauthausen had accompanying its environment there a stone quarry.</span> <span id="s1127">And the floor of that stone quarry was somewhere between two and 300 feet below the level of the ground.</span> <span id="s1128">And this man Wolf used to take the punishment company, which was composed primarily of Jews.</span> <span id="s1129">Because let me say this: There's absolutely no doubt about the fact that these campsDachau, Mauthausen, Flossenburg and Buchenwaldwere all used as instruments for the purpose of exterminating the Jews.</span> <span id="s1130">And you can tell that, because the Jews received the harshest work assignments.</span> <span id="s1131">They received the smallest amount of food.</span> <span id="s1132">And all the dirty, hard work that had to be accomplished was given to the Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s1133">And whenever anybody had something mean that had to be done, and I mean mean, that one prisoner fighting another, they would get one Jew and put him to do that task.</span> <span id="s1134">And I'll say this: That there was absolutely no doubt that any Jew that was able to survive those camps, the Lord has blessed him more and more than anyone will ever know.</span> <span id="s1135">Because they were objects of extermination of the system that they had there.</span> <span id="s1136">Well, Wolf had this punishment company which was composed primarily of Jews.</span> <span id="s1137">And one of the things they had to do was to carry a stone which weighed approximately 25 kilosthat's about 55 poundsfrom the bottom of the quarry up to the top at the end of the day.</span> <span id="s1138">And what else happened at end of the day, that Kapo selected one prisoner out of that group that received and had the opportunity to make the parachute jump without a parachute.</span> <span id="s1139">The other prisoners there would select the prisoner that had been picked out by Wolf, take his hands and his feet.</span> <span id="s1140">One for the money, two for the show, three to make merry, and over you go.</span> <span id="s1141">And they would throw him down and he would crash down to the bottom of the quarry.</span> <span id="s1142">It didn't happen every day.</span> <span id="s1143">It didn't happen every day, because there was more pressure put on these people because they didn't know which day it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1144">But no one of them knew whether or not he was going to be the next person to go one for the money, two for the show.</span> <span id="s1145">And they also had trees around the rim of the quarry.</span> <span id="s1146">And they would use those trees as catapults, and put a prisoner on there, bend it down, release it then he would be tossed out down to his death in the bottom of the quarry.</span> <span id="s1147">Well, spotsWolf was the commanding officer of this camp.</span> <span id="s1148">NowI mean of this detail.</span> <span id="s1149">And he made that selection.</span> <span id="s1150">Now, how many he selected there, I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1151">Nobody will ever know because it didn't happen every day.</span> <span id="s1152">But it happened so frequently that there was always that sense of urgency when you woke up in the morning as a member of that punishment detail as to whether or not you were going to make the parachute jump.</span> <span id="s1153">So Wolf was an individual that I think if anybody exercised clemency on his behalf they should be shot in the head and bled in the ______ of the foot.</span> <span id="s1154">Because he certainly wasn't entitled to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q:Did you prosecute a number of Kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A:Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1157">We had the Kapos from the crematory.</span> <span id="s1158">We had capos that had various work details that wouldone of them used to kill at a detail that was to take prisoners to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1159">I mean, angels of mercy.</span> <span id="s1160">And he was the Kapo in charge of this detail.</span> <span id="s1161">And he would throttle them with his bare hands.</span> <span id="s1162">So that the Kapos were hated by the prisoners who wore the red triangles.</span> <span id="s1163">And the Kapos usually were what was known as the block eldest.</span> <span id="s1164">Prisoner who was the oldest prisoner in the block.</span> <span id="s1165">They always got the benefit at the time that they had been in the penitentiary.</span> <span id="s1166">So they were the oldest prisoner in the block.</span> <span id="s1167">Not old in years, in age, but the oldest prisoner wise.</span> <span id="s1168">And they were hated and they hated each other.</span> <span id="s1169">They were hate from the crown of their heads to the sole of their feet.</span> <span id="s1170">And we had the Kapo from the crematory.</span> <span id="s1171">We had this Arthur Dietzsh, who was not a Kapo in thehe was a male nurse.</span> <span id="s1172">We put that moniker on him for a purpose.</span> <span id="s1173">We didn't want Dietzsh tainted with being a Kapo.</span> <span id="s1174">But he was a male Kapo actually.</span> <span id="s1175">But that was the consideration that we were terribly hopeful that the court would give to Dietzsh; that he was not just a Kapo, but he was a man who was a real man in his heart and soul.</span> <span id="s1176">There were few Kapos that had a heart.</span> <span id="s1177">Most of them had souls, but they were not entitled to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q:Well, after all of this, the trials that you were working on, did it change you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A:Physically, yes.</span> <span id="s1180">Mentally maybe.</span> <span id="s1181">Spiritually I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1182">And if you ask me to define what happened in each one of the three I tell you I couldn't possibly do it.</span> <span id="s1183">Except the physical part.</span> <span id="s1184">I was a physical wreck when I finished.</span> <span id="s1185">But I got an understanding of people under peculiar circumstances and their reactions that I could never have learned about elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1186">And hopefully I never will have to learn about.</span> <span id="s1187">Man's inhumanity to man is something that had no bounds in the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q:Did it make you pessimistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A:To some extent.</span> <span id="s1190">To some extent, yes.</span> <span id="s1191">I can look over my shoulder at things, see who's following me.</span> <span id="s1192">But I didn't do it then.</span> <span id="s1193">I wasn't looking over my shoulders at that time.</span> <span id="s1194">When you asked about security a moment ago, I shouldn't belittle the protection.</span> <span id="s1195">Because there in the camp there was a guard at the gate and there was a guard at every entrance to that camp.</span> <span id="s1196">And theythat didn't stop anybody crawling over.</span> <span id="s1197">But we had protection.</span> <span id="s1198">And I shouldn't belittle that.</span> <span id="s1199">I'm sorry if I left that impression.</span> <span id="s1200">And I'm not going back on everything else I said, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q:What gives you the most pride in what you did?</span> <span id="s1202">Are you proud?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A:Well, pride.</span> <span id="s1204">Pride goeth before destruction.</span> <span id="s1205">But now that we got that out of the way.</span> <span id="s1206">I took no pride in the fact that I had prosecuted 177 people in these trials.</span> <span id="s1207">And I took no pride in the fact that a lot of them were hanged and others received severe punishments of imprisonment.</span> <span id="s1208">The one thing that we got to remember is that these things came into being because there was a total disregard of human rights, and their protection.</span> <span id="s1209">As has been said, Dachau, Mauthausen, Flossenbürg and Buchenwald were all dungeons of democracy and so was the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1210">But the thing that Ithat really creates a sense of pride in my heart and feelings is when one of these true survivors of these camps in the Holocaust comes up to me and says, "We thank you for what you've done for us."</span> <span id="s1211">That I'm proud of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q:Have you met any survivors who were connected with any one of these</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A:Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1214">I had a friend who was a witness for me in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1215">He's dead now.</span> <span id="s1216">But he was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s1217">I hadn't seen him for years, and I ran into him in this very building where we're in now here in Mineola.</span> <span id="s1218">And I hadn't seen him.</span> <span id="s1219">And I was very fond of him and I used him extensively.</span> <span id="s1220">When I say extensively, because one who worked in the crematory really had a longevity of about three or four weeks.</span> <span id="s1221">Because the man in the crematory knew a lot.</span> <span id="s1222">And the Germans got rid of the people who knew a lot.</span> <span id="s1223">But Orenstein (ph) managed to stay in the crematory there at Mauthausen for a long time and made an excellent witness for me.</span> <span id="s1224">And I liked him very much as a man or human being.</span> <span id="s1225">And he came to this country after these trials and set up a business in Philadelphia and was extremely successful there.</span> <span id="s1226">He died there in last November, I think a year ago.</span> <span id="s1227">And I lost a dear friend.</span> <span id="s1228">Orenstein I'll always remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q:Well, Bill.</span> <span id="s1230">Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A:Happy to oblige.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span
