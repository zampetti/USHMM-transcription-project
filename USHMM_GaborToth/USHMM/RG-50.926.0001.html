power in Germany and this certainly was shaking up the world, very much the world in which I lived.</span> <span id="s9">I was born in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s10">Today Vilnius.</span> <span id="s11">Today it is the capital of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s12">But then it was called Vilna, and it was part of Poland.</span> <span id="s13">The frontiers in Europe have moved a lot since then.</span> <span id="s14">Since I was born in that time, so many things have happened.</span> <span id="s15">We live today in a very different world.</span> <span id="s16">But then, I remember an extraordinarily happy childhood, interrupted by sudden war; completely destroyed by the arrival of the German army; then the Russian Army; then the loss of a large part of my family; then my becoming a displaced person; my getting to Israel, as a refugee, in ’48, with the creation of the State of Israel; and then my moving out from Israel in ’56 to study in France painting, dedicating my life to painting.</span> <span id="s17">Not doing anything else besides painting, until this very day.</span> <span id="s18">Living in various countries, every time keeping my roots available in a small suitcase that I was taking from one place to another.</span> <span id="s19">Ended up finally, about 20 years ago, in the United States, where I became a citizen.</span> <span id="s20">My family, my grandparents and their parents, and the parents of their parents, all of them were what you call Litvaks.</span> <span id="s21">It means these were Lithuanian Jews.</span> <span id="s22">The Jews arrived to Lithuania mostly from Germany, mostly from the region of Alsace.</span> <span id="s23">In the 14th and 15th century, Lithuania was the last country in Europe to become Christian.</span> <span id="s24">There was an interest to transform a rural – very rural and a very primitive country – into a more productive society and a more structured society.</span> <span id="s25">The Jews were offered then, by the local authorities, a lot of autonomy, and very wonderful conditions of life.</span> <span id="s26">So that’s when they moved to that area, bringing with them the ancient German that became the Yiddish, which was our language.</span> <span id="s27">My families, when I was born, were of the middle class.</span> <span id="s28">One grandmother was a successful businesswoman.</span> <span id="s29">My father had a lab for dentures.</span> <span id="s30">We lived, I guess, a rather comfortable life.</span> <span id="s31">I was the first grandchild born to both grandparents so, in spite of being born into a Jewish family, I was called the little Yeshu’a, which means little baby Jesus, because I was so much responding to the desire of all the aunts, uncles, grandparents, and so on, of having this little baby come and bring them joy.</span> <span id="s32">I was a very spoiled brat, but also with a certain talent for painting.</span> <span id="s33">Actually, what happened is, I had a great uncle, the brother of my grandmother, who was a very renowned poet, writer, musician, a personality, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s34">Once my grandmother sent to her brother drawings that I made at the age of three or four, he immediately answered with a letter, well, this child is an artist.</span> <span id="s35">Don’t try to feed him anything else but kunst, kunst, and kunst – it means art, art, and art.</span> <span id="s36">This is somehow how that order of my great uncle, who later perished in Auschwitz, has established an attitude in all the members of my family that I was to become a painter, which was very much against my own interests, because I would have liked to be a fireman.</span> <span id="s37">I would have liked to sell candy in the street, or whatever, but I was supposed to become a painter.</span> <span id="s38">I guess that somewhere – I don’t know today if it is because I wanted to please my family retroactively, after most of them were assassinated by the Nazis, that I really stuck to it, because choosing art as a career is not a very easy thing, nor does one have too many guarantees of succeeding in that.</span> <span id="s39">It is between that and between the single fact that it is such a joy for me every day, every day of my life, to get back to my studio and continue painting.</span> <span id="s40">It is something that I do now for about 65 years.</span> <span id="s41">I became a painter.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">TRACK 03 – This Thing Called War The war started to announce itself to me in strange ways.</span> <span id="s43">I must say that when Europe was shaken by the occupation of Poland by Hitler’s army, that is the time when the Russians moved from the east and occupied my birth town, occupied Vilnius.</span> <span id="s44">Suddenly our house was full of refugees and people were listening to the radio and were discussing about what was going on, so on - so forth.</span> <span id="s45">Then there was a Russian general who kicked out my mother’s parents from their apartment, and my mother’s parents went to live with my father’s parents.</span> <span id="s46">I actually found – I was then about six or seven years – I found it rather fun.</span> <span id="s47">I thought this was wonderful, this thing called war, because my parents are having all these interesting people in our home, with suitcases.</span> <span id="s48">They move and they leave.</span> <span id="s49">My grandparents are all now for me, the four of them in one place.</span> <span id="s50">Then later, of course, things started to move very quickly.</span> <span id="s51">The Germans arrived in 1940.</span> <span id="s52">Then my father was taken to a camp to dig some turf, and I remained with my mother at home.</span> <span id="s53">Food became scarce.</span> <span id="s54">We had no right to have electricity, because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s55">We lost contact with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s56">We could not walk in the street.</span> <span id="s57">My two grandfathers disappeared.</span> <span id="s58">They were taken, actually, by some police to the killing fields near Vilnius and shot.</span> <span id="s59">Then one day the Lithuanian police stormed through the door of our apartment and dragged out my mother and me from our home and brought us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s60">Then suddenly I started very deeply disliking the idea of war.</span> <span id="s61">But, of course, I still had no idea about all the things that I will have to go through and live through.</span> <span id="s62">It was only the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">There are certain moments in my life that later furnished images to my paintings.</span> <span id="s64">I think that that specific moment in which we were forced to leave our home became embedded in my art.</span> <span id="s65">This has to do with the strange situation in which – although we were somehow prepared, and my mother has prepared a very small suitcase, saying if we have to leave, I’ll take this or that, but once the two policemen were there and we had to move very fast, she was at a loss.</span> <span id="s66">She took a suitcase, but then she ran to my room and took the pillow from my bed and gave it to me and said hold it, take it with you, it may be of use.</span> <span id="s67">Then we went to the door and I rushed back holding the pillow, thinking what happened now to my teddy bear because he was on my pillow, so he might have fallen.</span> <span id="s68">I saw to it that he was okay in the bed.</span> <span id="s69">Then we went out and we were in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s70">There were some other Jewish families that lived nearby or lived in the same building.</span> <span id="s71">It was a large building with a very large square courtyard.</span> <span id="s72">It was raining and we were little by little becoming wet, soaked, with water.</span> <span id="s73">Then we went out into the streets.</span> <span id="s74">The street was one stream of people.</span> <span id="s75">When I say stream, it was also so tragic, because the rain was very heavy and there was a lot of water streaming along the gutters of the street.</span> <span id="s76">Since Jews were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk, we had to walk in the water, walking in the direction of that part of the city, which was then decided to be the ghetto that the Germans created in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s77">Those few streets that were kind of shut off from the rest of the town became packed with something like 40,000 - 50,000 people.</span> <span id="s78">A dozen people per small room.</span> <span id="s79">I mean, it was really a very frightening situation.</span> <span id="s80">I also remember that at a certain point we were in a building from which people before that were taken out and killed, so it would make a place for the ones who arrived.</span> <span id="s81">Suddenly there was some screaming and yelling in the staircase, and that’s because a man committed suicide and he was hanging there from the handrail in the staircase.</span> <span id="s82">Then my mother holding me, keeping an eye on my face.</span> <span id="s83">By that time, I had already lost the pillow, because I abandoned the wet pillow that was too heavy, but we still had this tiny suitcase with us.</span> <span id="s84">We started running, and I think that we had lost the suitcase there somehow and we walked through these very crowded streets of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s85">It was the first day of the ghetto and we entered some other shop, and from that shop to another corridor.</span> <span id="s86">Then my mother tried to open another door, and suddenly we were outside.</span> <span id="s87">We were outside of the ghetto, because the ghetto was not yet hermetically closed in.</span> <span id="s88">This brought us to some courtyard that was not part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s89">And this is how – we were in the ghetto and then the next day, we were outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s90">Then what would we do, being outside of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s91">That was not so very simple.</span> <span id="s92">Luckily, my mother had an aunt.</span> <span id="s93">My grandfather’s sister, who as a young person, converted to Christianity, and she lived in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s94">It was the only address that we could think of.</span> <span id="s95">My mother, holding me by my hand, courageously went in that direction of that home.</span> <span id="s96">It was very lucky for the two of us, because my mother was blonde and had clear eyes.</span> <span id="s97">I was dark and I could have been identified as a Jewish child in a city where most of the people were blonde and had blue eyes.</span> <span id="s98">Somehow, we arrived to the home of my great aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">TRACK 04 – The Convent Here is an extraordinary thing of having survived, of having had so many incredible miracles happening to me, and letting me survive – be among the 200 or 250 Jews who found themselves in Vilnius the day they were liberated – 250 people of a community of about 80,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s100">Lithuania is quite well known for the highest rate of murdered Jews in the Nazi-occupied areas.</span> <span id="s101">Something like 95% or 96% of the people were annihilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Here comes the story of this miraculous event that allowed us then to find a hiding place.</span> <span id="s103">Is that my aunt, when she was about 12 or 13, most 14, was working for a baker in town, who was providing bread and cakes to one of the aristocratic palaces of Vilnius.</span> <span id="s104">The girl was very liked by the staff of the kitchen, and the lady who was the governess of that mansion liked the girl very much.</span> <span id="s105">She tried to convince her that she would be smart to escape from the place where she was employed and come to the palace, and let her take care of her.</span> <span id="s106">This is what happened.</span> <span id="s107">She agreed.</span> <span id="s108">The girl, who was then 12 or 13, agreed to that.</span> <span id="s109">Because the law permitted to baptize Jewish children and then take them away from their parents, once they were baptized, that’s what happened to this girl.</span> <span id="s110">She was then adopted by the governess and her husband.</span> <span id="s111">My aunt, Hana or then as she was called, Janina, was put to study in a college for girls of the better families of Vilnius.</span> <span id="s112">That was run by Benedictine sisters.</span> <span id="s113">She became very close to a couple of these sisters.</span> <span id="s114">Developed with them a very, very, very deep relationship.</span> <span id="s115">Years later, when she came to live in Vilnius already with children of her own, she contacted again her brother, my grandfather, and we became very close to her, in spite of the fact that by now she was a good Catholic.</span> <span id="s116">That helped us to be allowed to hide in the convent of the Benedictine sisters, who made a very special place for us in the area that was called the clausura, which was an area that was completely closed to the outer world.</span> <span id="s117">They even had to have a permit of the Bishop of Vilna, so that my aunt, her husband, and my father would be able to join us and hide together in that place.</span> <span id="s118">In spite of the fact that in that area, which was of women only, no man was ever permitted to access, unless it was really very important to make some repairs of windows, or roofs, or ceilings, or whatever.</span> <span id="s119">So we were very lucky that we had a hiding place there.</span> <span id="s120">That lasted for something like seven or eight months that we were hidden in one room in that convent.</span> <span id="s121">Of course, not being able to leave the room and being in touch only with three or four of the sisters who knew about us, because it was within the convent, the place that was secret.</span> <span id="s122">Then the Germans decided to take that convent away from the church and turn it into a place where they would collect books and artifacts of the entire area of Poland and Russia, which would serve them as material for what they planned, a Museum of the Once Existing Nations.</span> <span id="s123">It was an organization called the Rosenberg Headquarters that was dealing with this project of creating that museum, and they decided to take over the convent.</span> <span id="s124">We somehow miraculously happened to escape that place, just at the time in which all the sisters were put on trucks that took them to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s125">We managed somehow to – when I say we, it was myself, my mother, my aunt, my father, and my uncle – and we managed to get into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s126">By that time, the population of the ghetto was about 19,000.</span> <span id="s127">More than half of the people already were killed by then.</span> <span id="s128">The German authorities found it possible, somehow, to nourish these people who were then corralled in three or four streets, and use them as slave labor.</span> <span id="s129">That’s where our life continued for another couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">In the ghetto, in that lull between one period of destruction and then what happened about a year and a half or two years later, the proper destruction of the ghetto, in this lull there was suddenly, in the ghetto, in spite of the incredibly dire conditions, a kind of awakening of arts.</span> <span id="s131">People organized the theater.</span> <span id="s132">There were jazz concerts.</span> <span id="s133">There was jazz, there was singing, music, classical music.</span> <span id="s134">Vilna was culturally a very important center in the Jewish life, in the European east, so there were many writers, poets, painters, who wrote and painted, and wrote music.</span> <span id="s135">That is where, in the ghetto, two poets who worked for the Rosenberg administration as slave laborers, and were putting together enormous piles of books that came from various Jewish libraries.</span> <span id="s136">Those two poets, one of them by the name of Abraham Sutzkever, is maybe the greatest Yiddish poet of the 20th century.</span> <span id="s137">He survived.</span> <span id="s138">But those two poets were relatively young and took great interest in this boy who was a little child prodigy – myself – and managed to find for me paper and pencils and encouraged me to draw and paint.</span> <span id="s139">In order to provide me with material to work, they found and smuggled into the ghetto from that place where they were collecting books, an ancient book that belonged to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s140">A book that dealt mainly with the various Jewish organizations of philanthropy in the 18th century and the 19th century.</span> <span id="s141">That book had very beautifully inscribed pages, very beautifully handwritten calligraphy, with various names of people of committees and the deeds they did.</span> <span id="s142">But there were empty pages and they told me to just take this book and make drawings here.</span> <span id="s143">I was made to understand that if this book had some chances to survive, they are much greater than my chances to survive, and that this book will be a witness.</span> <span id="s144">But to me, as a child, I do not think that this whole notion of death was very clear.</span> <span id="s145">I mean, even today, to any grownup, even the ones who have witnessed the death of their closest people, one’s own death is never a very clear possibility.</span> <span id="s146">It’s something we know.</span> <span id="s147">One day we will not exist, but how is it?</span> <span id="s148">When I was in the ghetto, the idea of not being there did not really preoccupy me very much.</span> <span id="s149">So, I was making drawings in this book.</span> <span id="s150">What is really strange and very unusual is that that book, which I took with me later to a labor camp and I lost it in the labor camp, was found.</span> <span id="s151">It is today, part of the Jewish museum’s holdings in Vilnius, with my drawings that I did at age eight or nine.</span> <span id="s152">This book was called The Pinkas.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">TRACK 05 - The Children’s Action Life in the ghetto for me was not really very frightening because I was rather sheltered by my parents, who had to go out early every morning for work and they returned late.</span> <span id="s154">But we had our tiny space, where there were two bunks, one above another.</span> <span id="s155">I had my pencils.</span> <span id="s156">I did not go to one of the schools in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s157">I had a teacher, a lady who in the evenings took it on herself to teach me.</span> <span id="s158">I had access to a library in the ghetto, so I was reading books.</span> <span id="s159">I was reading about a book a day.</span> <span id="s160">I was an incredible reader.</span> <span id="s161">All this went on for about a period, as I was saying, of about a year and a half or two years.</span> <span id="s162">Then the German army started to have significant losses in Russia.</span> <span id="s163">It became clear that the Germans will retreat and that they will destroy the ghetto, with the inhabitants of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">What happened in the history of the ghetto of Vilna, which wasn’t known for any years, now it is quite known, because there are books about it and it is historically shown like maybe more fascinating story than the Schindler story.</span> <span id="s165">There was this Major Plagge, German, who was a major of an age of between 45 and 50, who lost one of his legs in the First World War, but worked for the army.</span> <span id="s166">He was an engineer.</span> <span id="s167">He organized a camp in which men were transforming cars, from cars that were running on fuel to cars that were running on burning wood.</span> <span id="s168">They had kind of kettles with burning wood on the cars themselves, because of a scarcity of gas in a time of the war.</span> <span id="s169">This unit became very important to the German army.</span> <span id="s170">They must have had about 400 to 500 slave laborers from the ghetto, well chosen.</span> <span id="s171">They had to be very efficient mechanics, technicians, and my father found this job - he was sent to this job - and he did his work very well, so he was in this group.</span> <span id="s172">Now, Major Plagge – I remember him, but you know, as you can remember a German officer in his uniform and his boots, and so on, from far away – but I heard that he was the “Good German.”</span> <span id="s173">Now he managed to have the permission, just a few days before the liquidation of the ghetto and before all these 18,000 or 19,000 Jews of the ghetto were sent to various death camps, he managed to have the workers of his unit, with their wives and their children, moved to a camp a little outside of town.</span> <span id="s174">It must have been about 1,500 people.</span> <span id="s175">So these 1,500 survivors of a population of about 19,000 people who remained in Vilnius after the ghetto was completely destroyed and the people put to death.</span> <span id="s176">Many were shot in the forests of Vilna, which is in a place call Ponary.</span> <span id="s177">But we were there.</span> <span id="s178">My father continued his job.</span> <span id="s179">I think it was maybe the only camp in which families still were in the same labor camp.</span> <span id="s180">Of course, the conditions of life were very, very hard.</span> <span id="s181">People had to work many, many, many hours, but still, we were alive.</span> <span id="s182">From us children – I was about 10 or 11 -- there wasn’t much to be required.</span> <span id="s183">That lasted for about 6 months, like from September to March.</span> <span id="s184">Then it became clear that Plagge wasn’t able to have any more of the control that he had on this camp.</span> <span id="s185">It is known today from writings that he left, from contents that he had, that his idea was to find a reason to save as many Jews as possible.</span> <span id="s186">Today he is recognized by the Museum Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, as one of the righteous Christians.</span> <span id="s187">In Germany, there are military institutions that carry his name and so on.</span> <span id="s188">He is a hero.</span> <span id="s189">But at that time, I didn’t know that he was a hero, nor did he know that he would one day become a hero, after his death.</span> <span id="s190">At a certain point, the German authorities much above Major Plagge decided that the children weren’t necessary.</span> <span id="s191">On the contrary, they were just taking up too much food, and the children had to be eliminated.</span> <span id="s192">One day, trucks arrived to the camp.</span> <span id="s193">We must have been about 200 or 300 children in that camp.</span> <span id="s194">Some German army men started to yell, all the children out, all the children out.</span> <span id="s195">I guess that at that point my mother realized – it was early in the morning and my father was already away – that this was the end.</span> <span id="s196">By that time she was going to lose me and, of course, she knew much more than at that age I was permitted to know.</span> <span id="s197">She started to go towards the staircase.</span> <span id="s198">In the staircase there were many, many women and children that were coming down.</span> <span id="s199">At a certain point, we were stopped by a friend of ours, who lived on the ground floor, and she dragged us into one of the rooms and pushed us almost by force into that room, put me under the bed and said, hide.</span> <span id="s200">I was under the bed there, and there was another boy, and there was another girl under the bed.</span> <span id="s201">I heard some people were making noise at the door.</span> <span id="s202">Later I discovered that it was my father who then came there and the husband of this woman.</span> <span id="s203">They were dragging all kinds of debris and putting it against the door, in order to mask the door.</span> <span id="s204">My father had with him a couple of coins in gold, or they were, I think, imitation of gold, or whatever.</span> <span id="s205">He was standing near there, and when the German soldiers with the rifles came to check, you know, wherever there were doors, if the doors were open, and so on, my father pushed that coin into the hand of the German soldier, who quickly grabbed this and passed by this door.</span> <span id="s206">I was under the bed, and I was hearing screamings and children crying, women screaming at the soldiers, murderers, and then some shots, and it was obvious that somebody must have been killed there.</span> <span id="s207">And then the trucks left.</span> <span id="s208">What has happened in reality is that I think about 30 of the children of these – I don’t know the number precisely, 250 I would say, between 250 and 300 – about 30 of these children survived, hiding in various places and finding an escape from the army that came to pick them up.</span> <span id="s209">Well, the others were of course brought to the place where they were shot.</span> <span id="s210">I remained in the camp with my parents.</span> <span id="s211">What I must say, in terms of the security of keeping the people in the camp, no one dared to escape, although it was not that very difficult.</span> <span id="s212">There were ways to escape from the camp.</span> <span id="s213">Because we all were given numbers and we were counted twice a day, the morning and the evening.</span> <span id="s214">If one number was missing, five people before that number and five people after that number were shot.</span> <span id="s215">So the people were watching each other and felt also very responsible.</span> <span id="s216">No one dared to move out, because the price was frightening.</span> <span id="s217">Actually, there was a family, a father, mother, and a child, who tried to escape early on, and they were hanged publicly in the camp, so that would be a kind of signal.</span> <span id="s218">This is what expects you.</span> <span id="s219">And then a certain number, I think, 30 people were taken and shot.</span> <span id="s220">They said anyone escapes.</span> <span id="s221">But what happened in that action in which the children were taken away, some mothers who tried to tear away their children from the soldiers were shot by the soldiers.</span> <span id="s222">Then their husbands and other men buried these women in the ground.</span> <span id="s223">Suddenly, it wasn’t clear how any women were shot.</span> <span id="s224">Then my mother, considering herself as one of the women that were shot, managed to escape from the camp, trying to find a way to prepare the ground to have me smuggled out of the camp.</span> <span id="s225">And she managed.</span> <span id="s226">After about three days of being hidden in the camp, my father was able, by carrying me in a sack, similar to the other sacks in which people were carrying wood for the trucks that were actually then working on little cubes of wood, so there were thousands of sacks of wood.</span> <span id="s227">I was supposed to be wood in one of those sacks.</span> <span id="s228">My father carried me on his shoulder through the camp and brought me to the place, which was on the brink of the free world, and managed to make me slide out from a window and run towards a person that my mother managed to send to the area of the camp to pick me up, and brought me again to the aunt of my mother, to Aunt Janina.</span> <span id="s229">This was just one of those miracles that made it possible for me to be sitting here and telling this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">TRACK 06 – The Escape We arrived to my mother’s aunt, but it was obvious we could not stay there.</span> <span id="s231">We tried to find another place, but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s232">There came yet another very dramatic moment in the story of our survival with my mother.</span> <span id="s233">We had no place to go.</span> <span id="s234">Remaining with the aunt was endangering her life – not only her life and the life of her two sons.</span> <span id="s235">She [my mother] decided that it was enough.</span> <span id="s236">She would go to a bridge nearby that house and take me in her arms and jump into the river and put an end to our misery.</span> <span id="s237">I remember.</span> <span id="s238">I mean, I did not know her intention, but I remember we went – we went right to the center of this bridge and we stood, and I looked down at the water.</span> <span id="s239">The water was then a lot of melting ice.</span> <span id="s240">The stream was very strong.</span> <span id="s241">Some dead cattle was swimming underwater, some pieces of houses that were inundated.</span> <span id="s242">It was a very dramatic, unusual sight.</span> <span id="s243">I was fascinated with that.</span> <span id="s244">I did not ask myself why was my mother standing there.</span> <span id="s245">It was only later years that she told me what was going on in her head.</span> <span id="s246">Then suddenly, what came to her mind is that she heard that some of the sisters that were sent to the labor camp were allowed to return to the convent.</span> <span id="s247">She thought, well, why won’t I try to get to the convent and see if there is one of those sisters, maybe they can give us shelter.</span> <span id="s248">So after standing for I don’t know how long on that bridge, the sirens started to sound, which meant that it was the moment was arriving in which it wasn’t allowed any more to circulate in the streets.</span> <span id="s249">It must have been something like 6:00 in the evening, and people started to run, people that were crossing the bridge, and so on.</span> <span id="s250">It was clear that we had about 5 to 10 minutes and we had to disappear.</span> <span id="s251">So my mother suddenly grabbed me by my hand and we ran, and we arrived to the closed gate of that convent.</span> <span id="s252">She started to bang on the door of the convent.</span> <span id="s253">She banged, and she banged, and she banged.</span> <span id="s254">Suddenly the door opened and an old woman was standing there.</span> <span id="s255">When she saw us she pulled us in and she hugged us.</span> <span id="s256">Suddenly I recognized her.</span> <span id="s257">This was one of the sisters.</span> <span id="s258">I had never seen her, you know, not in her formal dress of a sister.</span> <span id="s259">I could not recognize her, and then she aged by something like 20 years in those two years, at best, meanwhile.</span> <span id="s260">This was Sister Maria Mikulska.</span> <span id="s261">She was also recognized as a righteous Christian.</span> <span id="s262">I was in Vilnius to receive the Medal of Honor for her, for her good deeds, from the President of Lithuania, a medal that I have with me today, because I’m the only one to whom this medal was given to, to be deposited with.</span> <span id="s263">This was still yet another miracle.</span> <span id="s264">What has actually happened before, and this we did not know, that this sister was hiding about 10 other Jews in that convent, among the books that were being concentrated, lodged there, stored in that place.</span> <span id="s265">Books that were later sent to Berlin.</span> <span id="s266">The most amazing story here, I mean, almost forbidden to happen in novels in fiction is that this we didn’t know, nor was it anything that I knew when I wrote my memoir, is that when the books left that place where we were hiding and arrived to Berlin, my mother’s uncle, Arno Nadel, the one who decided I was to be an artist, he was the one who was receiving these books.</span> <span id="s267">He was a slave laborer in Berlin for the Rosenberg Headquarters.</span> <span id="s268">In his diaries that were then saved by a very good friend of his, a famous artist and sculptor in Germany, a lady called Kathe Kolvitz, he described this strange feeling that he had by receiving these precious books from Vilna and holding them in his hands.</span> <span id="s269">He had no idea that these were the books on which we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s270">I mean, you cannot invent such coincidences.</span> <span id="s271">And it was only a few years ago when somebody prepared a lecture in a university on my great uncle and quoted from his diaries that I learned this absolutely unbelievable fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">So here we were, hidden in this convent, from March until July.</span> <span id="s273">In July, the Russian army occupied Vilnius.</span> <span id="s274">About a week before the arrival of the Russians, the Germans machine-gunned all the people that were in the camp.</span> <span id="s275">Among them, they killed my father.</span> <span id="s276">It was just a few days before the liberation.</span> <span id="s277">It was a few days before he became age 37.</span> <span id="s278">We found ourselves among the 250 people, more or less, of the Jews of Vilna, who have remained alive.</span> <span id="s279">Later, some people who escaped into the woods and who became partisans, started to return.</span> <span id="s280">I think that about 2,500 Jews of the community of about 80,000 have survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s281">I was one of the most lucky ones.</span> <span id="s282">So, of course, with this sense of having been given my life by so many incredible events, incredible events – there is an event, for instance, I did not mention.</span> <span id="s283">When the fighting for the streets of Vilnius was going on, some streets were already the Russian army, some streets were still occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s284">We were still by the German-held place.</span> <span id="s285">The convent started to be on fire.</span> <span id="s286">Some firemen came running to see if they could put out the fire of the convent.</span> <span id="s287">Then they saw us, they discovered us, and they realized, of course, that we were Jews, and the head of the firemen must have been a very, very energetic anti-Semite, because seeing us, he decided that he would go immediately rush to call the Germans.</span> <span id="s288">He told the other men, hold them, hold them, I’m running to bring the Germans.</span> <span id="s289">We looked at each other and it was clear that we will hear machine guns in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s290">He came out from a gate and he was killed by bullets that were just passing through the street.</span> <span id="s291">He fell in his blood on the ground.</span> <span id="s292">So this was the last miracle.</span> <span id="s293">It’s almost, for me, although I’ve told these stories, I’ve written about them, and every time when I tell it again, I have almost difficulty in believing in them.</span> <span id="s294">But this is how it happened, and this is what gave me maybe this kind of very strong need to give sense to these strange miracles, by doing the work that somehow relates to what has happened, not only to me, but to so many, many, many people.</span> <span id="s295">This is something that I must say.</span> <span id="s296">It is not only a Jewish story, it’s just a Jewish story in my case, because I was condemned to die by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s297">But it is a story of humanity, in which suddenly some people are convinced that they have the right of life and death over other people, and they start to think that they are better.</span> <span id="s298">So it’s a mighty subject.</span> <span id="s299">In my case, I could not be just an artist who thinks in terms of colors, shapes, and so on.</span> <span id="s300">Of course, I also think in these terms, because this is what makes art art.</span> <span id="s301">But there is in me a very treat necessity to speak about things that touch the core of my experience.</span> <span id="s302">And maybe with that, somehow thankful for the privilege of being still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">TRACK 07 – The Russian Army The loss of my father, for my mother, was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s304">I felt that now the loss of her parents, the loss of other members of the family, the loss of the friends and so on – it was she, myself, and I am now the one who is going to repair the situation.</span> <span id="s305">There is also something almost neurotic, something very Oedipal in such a situation, when the son decides that he has to repair the broken life of his mother.</span> <span id="s306">I mean, there is a limit to how much we can repair things.</span> <span id="s307">But this sense of being able or taking on myself a responsibility of repair, goes into two other directions.</span> <span id="s308">One is the ancient Jewish sense of the world of the broken vessels.</span> <span id="s309">The broken vessels that were broken by man’s misdeeds, by bad actions, and it is our duty to repair those vessels.</span> <span id="s310">So this is a kind of philosophical metaphor of repair, which is called the Tikkun.</span> <span id="s311">What is called the Tikkun is this concept of doing good.</span> <span id="s312">I very often depict a broken world.</span> <span id="s313">A world made of bits and pieces.</span> <span id="s314">They are put together to try to somehow repair something.</span> <span id="s315">For me then, I was explaining to people what do I mean by all these still lifes that I paint, where the objects have been broken, somebody tried to put them together.</span> <span id="s316">The things fit, but they do not fit.</span> <span id="s317">So this was my life after the war, in the community of the survivors.</span> <span id="s318">Who were we?</span> <span id="s319">Very many families were recomposed.</span> <span id="s320">My mother married a man who lost his wife and his two daughters.</span> <span id="s321">I became his son.</span> <span id="s322">My mother lived always with the ghost of my father in her head.</span> <span id="s323">He lived always with the ghost of his lost daughters, so we were this kind of recomposed family, and all the people around us.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Only the ones who really spoke to each other would have the terms of reference of the experience of surviving the hell of the Holocaust, because they communicated.</span> <span id="s325">They communicated with each other.</span> <span id="s326">They could speak with each other.</span> <span id="s327">Then the same people who lived through that, once they were exposed to the outer world, even to their own children who were born after the war, they could not talk.</span> <span id="s328">They could not tell, because they did not share terms of reference that were possible.</span> <span id="s329">So for me, yes, this thing of trying to repair – once we were liberated by the Russians, and once we met again, the same two boys, Sutzkever and Kaczerginski, who were saved by the Russians, and they became very interested again in what I was doing.</span> <span id="s330">Suddenly, the Russian authorities knew that there was this child prodigy.</span> <span id="s331">I was supposed to be taken away from my mother and sent to Moscow to a very special school.</span> <span id="s332">My mother was about to lose me, and we had to escape from Vilnius.</span> <span id="s333">This was immediately after the end of the war, in 1945.</span> <span id="s334">By then, already a year has passed, while we were under the Soviet rule, the Stalinist rule.</span> <span id="s335">We were liberated in July and by mid-May, the beginning of May, the war was over.</span> <span id="s336">The Germans capitulated.</span> <span id="s337">And then, in the summer of that year, it had been about a year after our liberation, the Russians started to expose the former Polish citizens from Vilnius to Poland.</span> <span id="s338">This was an occasion for us to escape from the Russians, because my mother was terribly afraid to lose me.</span> <span id="s339">By having me taken to Moscow and then being put into a very special school, where they had a few painters, and a few musicians, and a few dancers, and so on, children that had big promises, and they were somehow going to create the geniuses of the Stalinist paradise.</span> <span id="s340">So then we escaped to Poland, and then my mother decided to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s341">From there, we went to Germany.</span> <span id="s342">We went to Berlin, first to look for her uncle, for my great uncle.</span> <span id="s343">So we arrived in Berlin in 1945.</span> <span id="s344">This was the Berlin after the war.</span> <span id="s345">It was all still as it was in the day of the surrender of the Germans.</span> <span id="s346">It was terribly bombed.</span> <span id="s347">There my mother learned that her uncle was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s348">From there, we arrived to the American area of occupation in Germany, which was Bavaria, which was south of Germany.</span> <span id="s349">We arrived to a place called Landsberg.</span> <span id="s350">There was a big camp of mainly Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s351">We were the DPs, the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s352">We were the people who were waiting for some visas, for some permits to move elsewhere, where they could start life again.</span> <span id="s353">It was very difficult to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s354">There was a quota.</span> <span id="s355">It was practically impossible to get to Palestine, because the British did not allow any Jews to get to Palestine.</span> <span id="s356">Then Palestine was under British mandatory rule.</span> <span id="s357">So we waited.</span> <span id="s358">We waited.</span> <span id="s359">From 1945 until 1948, we waited in that DP camp.</span> <span id="s360">By that time, my mother was married, with the survivor of Dachau.</span> <span id="s361">In 1948, when the State of Israel was declared, and suddenly the gates of Israel opened to Jews arriving from Europe, we left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">When we arrived to Israel it was obvious that our story was not a story that anyone in Israel wanted to hear.</span> <span id="s363">They didn’t want to hear the stories.</span> <span id="s364">We arrived at a very crucial moment in Israel.</span> <span id="s365">Israel was fighting for its survival.</span> <span id="s366">Israel was fighting armies that surrounded it.</span> <span id="s367">It was a population of about 600,000 people who were going to absorb about 2,000,000 people.</span> <span id="s368">It was absolutely incredible.</span> <span id="s369">The austerity was going to last for about 3 or 4 years, you know, rationing cars and such things.</span> <span id="s370">If Israel survived, the moment of the Arab attack, and was able to establish itself as an independent state, it was because people knew that they must be heroes, or they will be dead.</span> <span id="s371">We, the people who survived the Holocaust, who arrived there, we were the Jews who allowed themselves to be led to slaughter like sheep.</span> <span id="s372">We were not respected.</span> <span id="s373">We were kind of accepted.</span> <span id="s374">No one wanted to hear these frightening stories.</span> <span id="s375">So the survivors were among themselves.</span> <span id="s376">We were not very proud.</span> <span id="s377">I tried to dress exactly like the Sabras, like the boys or girls that were born in Israel.</span> <span id="s378">I would not talk about these experiences.</span> <span id="s379">I tried to learn Hebrew very fast and speak it as much as possible, the accent of the ones of the country, and it was only a few years later when Israeli agents caught Eichmann, and there were the trials of Eichmann, that German officer who was the creator of the industry of death to the Jews that the Nazis have established.</span> <span id="s380">Then, suddenly, the story of the Holocaust and all its implications, and all its mechanism, and the power of this machine to enslave and destroy millions of people, that became clear.</span> <span id="s381">Then, suddenly, the attitude changed.</span> <span id="s382">By that time, many years have passed and somehow, some people who arrived as survivors remained living within their little enclaves of people with whom things were shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">TRACK 08 – Arrival in Israel So, my arrival in Israel, my normal schooling in Israel, suddenly I have to study 24 hours.</span> <span id="s384">I have to learn so many things I never knew existed, and I’m terribly frustrated, because I cannot dedicate time to painting.</span> <span id="s385">I somehow managed from time to time to paint.</span> <span id="s386">I finished my studies, and I went a year to art school.</span> <span id="s387">In the art school it was clear that I knew much too much about art.</span> <span id="s388">The school advised me to remain as little as possible and to move on.</span> <span id="s389">I mean, it was as if I were in college and they said you look – you have to graduate school now.</span> <span id="s390">But this I could only do abroad.</span> <span id="s391">For me the idea was to go back to Paris.</span> <span id="s392">I said go back to Paris, because in Paris my father was conceived when my grandfather was escaping from the Tsar police, was hiding in Paris.</span> <span id="s393">So for me to go to Paris and study in Paris was always somehow to go back home.</span> <span id="s394">To go back to the place where my grandfather admired so much.</span> <span id="s395">But before that, I had to do almost three years of army service, in the Israeli army, which I did.</span> <span id="s396">And then I went to Paris.</span> <span id="s397">Of course, Paris was then the center of world art.</span> <span id="s398">I tried to find my way as a very modern and abstract artist and, somehow, because of personal events in my life, my first marriage, I ended up in Rome.</span> <span id="s399">I had an exhibition of art in Rome, and the exhibition was a big success, and I remained in Rome.</span> <span id="s400">I painted very much of the crest of the wave of what was called modern art.</span> <span id="s401">Then my abstract art became very gloomy, very dark, frightening, even to me.</span> <span id="s402">I realized that there was a need in me to say something.</span> <span id="s403">Maybe I was trying to speak about something that is scary, but in a way that is not really understandable.</span> <span id="s404">I think that I somehow got to a point in which it was clear that I was in a kind of a crisis, and I had to find another way.</span> <span id="s405">I thought, well, how can I speak to people?</span> <span id="s406">How can I attract people to what I want to tell them?</span> <span id="s407">This is not to speak directly, not to speak graphically.</span> <span id="s408">To speak metaphorically.</span> <span id="s409">To speak through symbols.</span> <span id="s410">To speak through icons.</span> <span id="s411">I thought, what attracts people?</span> <span id="s412">Why do people stop in museums and look at paintings that were painted centuries before the Renaissance, and so on?</span> <span id="s413">Let me imagine some paintings that were painted in the Renaissance, but at night.</span> <span id="s414">Some things happened at midnight, and these paintings aged by three or four centuries, and the speak of the world, still in the language of the Renaissance, but of the world that has known the cataclysmic events of the Second World War.</span> <span id="s415">I came suddenly like this to the painting that I am doing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">At that time, I was, I believe, close to 30, over 30 years of age.</span> <span id="s417">I landed suddenly in this what people later called post modern, a very funny concept.</span> <span id="s418">It’s never interested me.</span> <span id="s419">Or what people call surrealism, because things were not exactly the way they seem us, a simple appearance.</span> <span id="s420">They were somehow transformed.</span> <span id="s421">Surrealism didn’t interest me, because surrealism was dealing with the subconscious, with dreams, with all kinds of things that were not what I was trying to say.</span> <span id="s422">I was trying to speak about really what is unspeakable, which is so frightening that people are afraid to touch.</span> <span id="s423">So, I thought, well, let me see.</span> <span id="s424">The world has gone through a major catastrophe, but still people find the resilience in them to continue.</span> <span id="s425">They want to repair whatever was left of that.</span> <span id="s426">So I started to paint still lifes, in which all the objects have suffered terrible destruction and yet are being recomposed.</span> <span id="s427">The recomposition of objects also allowed me to speak what I think about what we are telling in our memoirs and our reminiscences.</span> <span id="s428">It is always a kind of a recreation of things.</span> <span id="s429">Then I thought, how is it that human wisdom has allowed such things to happen, and then I thought the human wisdom that made man lose his paradise, the lost paradise, the fruit of wisdom.</span> <span id="s430">What was the fruit of wisdom?</span> <span id="s431">We don’t know what the fruit of wisdom was.</span> <span id="s432">In the Renaissance it was mostly apples.</span> <span id="s433">But sometimes it is even a pear.</span> <span id="s434">I thought, well, the pear has a nice, womanlike shape.</span> <span id="s435">Let me take that pear of the wisdom and let that wisdom be transformed in many shapes.</span> <span id="s436">So I dedicated many paintings to the metamorphosis of the pear, where the pear became something that speaks of the questions that the human wisdom brings up to be shared, not always responses.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Then I thought of myself surviving.</span> <span id="s438">My best friend, who was the son of my mother’s best friend, whose name was like my own name, Samek.</span> <span id="s439">He was my age.</span> <span id="s440">It was almost as if we were twins, although we were very different.</span> <span id="s441">But he was my best friend.</span> <span id="s442">He was a boy who did not survive.</span> <span id="s443">While we were being hidden in the convent, he was with a Christian nanny, but some neighbors gave him out.</span> <span id="s444">The German police came.</span> <span id="s445">They shot the boy in the courtyard of that house and left his body.</span> <span id="s446">No one was allowed to touch the body.</span> <span id="s447">The body of the boy, the killed boy, had to be left there for the people to see what happens if they find a Jew and what would happen to them if they dare to hide a Jew.</span> <span id="s448">So I thought, here is this boy called Samek, like myself, Samek, short for Samuel or Sam, became Samek.</span> <span id="s449">I must tell the story of Samek.</span> <span id="s450">And then I found suddenly that he and myself, we looked exactly like the boy in the famous photograph of the Jews that are taken out in the time of the liquidation of the ghetto of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s451">The boy that appeared on hundreds of books or journals, the little boy with his arms lifted.</span> <span id="s452">I thought, well, this boy and myself, and this – we don’t know if this boy survived.</span> <span id="s453">A few men claimed that they were that boy and that father, but we don’t know.</span> <span id="s454">I somehow dedicated to this boy, because this is a very easily readable symbol.</span> <span id="s455">I dedicated paintings to that boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Now, for instance, I am working on a lot of paintings that have to do with the cup.</span> <span id="s457">The cup, which is a kind of container, a vessel.</span> <span id="s458">You say, our cup was full.</span> <span id="s459">What does it mean when they say our cup was full?</span> <span id="s460">Was our cup full of happiness, or was our cup full of suffering?</span> <span id="s461">How did we perceive the cup?</span> <span id="s462">How do we preserve the cup?</span> <span id="s463">Again, the cup can be either representative of the broken vessel.</span> <span id="s464">The cup is the domesticity.</span> <span id="s465">I have described in one of my paintings the sending out of the Jews to the ghetto, like hundreds of cups that were thrown into the streets, and the streets are littered with broken cups.</span> <span id="s466">Domesticity somehow thrown out into the street.</span> <span id="s467">So, I am taking these very common objects of daily life and I am trying to project them into a kind of almost mythological style of something is happening to them that must mean something about the world in which we live.</span> <span id="s468">Unfortunately, the Jewish Holocaust did not teach the lesson it could have taught.</span> <span id="s469">There is a lot of work still to be done about this.</span> <span id="s470">Genocides continue to happen in Africa, and in other places.</span> <span id="s471">Religion plays sometimes a frightening role in these things.</span> <span id="s472">The concept of my God is better than your God.</span> <span id="s473">My God takes away from you the right to be – well, for your God to exist to you.</span> <span id="s474">All these things, the anti-Semitism of the Nazis was nurtured by centuries before that of anti-Semitism of a church.</span> <span id="s475">It was very late to recognize how damaging this was.</span> <span id="s476">After all, the Vatican declared it only a few decades ago, the things against the Jews were wrong.</span> <span id="s477">So there are centuries of religion that have created and not only Christian religion today.</span> <span id="s478">Today we can see what is done in the name of the extremists of the Muslim religion, or even by the extremists of the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s479">All the religions, once they become instruments of power, become much more dangerous than guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">TRACK 09 – Speaking the Unspeakable Some of the figures, various figures, female as well as male, have eyes that do not see, that do not exist.</span> <span id="s481">This kind of blindness is sometimes voluntary, sometimes the result of ignorance.</span> <span id="s482">The world was already starting to disintegrate in some areas in Europe.</span> <span id="s483">I remember, I was a child of six or seven, and there were already refugees from Warsaw in our house.</span> <span id="s484">People were sitting at a table and so on, and they’re saying yes, but this cannot happen here.</span> <span id="s485">They were blind, obviously, to the future.</span> <span id="s486">This is how they tried to protect themselves.</span> <span id="s487">To protect the world.</span> <span id="s488">To keep the kind of denial alive.</span> <span id="s489">I think that this blindness has something to do with denial that I want to speak of.</span> <span id="s490">In some way, none of us knows what is going to happen in five minutes from here.</span> <span id="s491">I mean, every time I have an appointment with a friend in a restaurant, I take my car, I leave my home.</span> <span id="s492">What do I know?</span> <span id="s493">A drunk driver may come from the other side.</span> <span id="s494">I mean, there is something of this incertitude or maybe this sense of incertitude is so deeply rooted in me because of all these events in my life, where my life was on the brink of being extinguished, that I have the sense of something miraculous happening to me.</span> <span id="s495">When in the morning I open my eyes and I’m in this beautiful house.</span> <span id="s496">I have another day and I can work.</span> <span id="s497">I think, my goodness, this year I am 80, and so many of my friends have left, and I still have this pleasure of waking up.</span> <span id="s498">My wife is still near me, and my studio is waiting.</span> <span id="s499">This is absolutely fantastic, but I have absolutely no feeling that anyone guarantees that this will be also the day after tomorrow.</span> <span id="s500">I have to wait until the day after tomorrow and then see again in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">There is so much of my art that is becoming material for teaching.</span> <span id="s502">This is absolutely extraordinary.</span> <span id="s503">There are hundreds of books that use my art for their covers, because the people feel that they can – in languages that I have absolutely no idea – that I cannot even read.</span> <span id="s504">But they’re paintings of mine.</span> <span id="s505">So, obviously, somewhere unwillingly, with my eyes shut, I hit the nail on its head.</span> <span id="s506">I consider myself very, very lucky that I have this response.</span> <span id="s507">On the other hand, I do not like to be the interpreter of my work.</span> <span id="s508">You see, I feel that an artist should not say, when I painted this or when I wrote that, what I meant is this or that.</span> <span id="s509">I think that the creative miracle, which is this miracle of a connection, happens when the beholder brings also something from himself to the thing that he is confronted with, and something then happens.</span> <span id="s510">It doesn’t have to be necessarily precisely 100% what I meant.</span> <span id="s511">That person has the right to interpret it his way.</span> <span id="s512">And if I am saying, when I did this, my intention was that, what do I know?</span> <span id="s513">I am also somewhere working with my subconscious.</span> <span id="s514">If I had my subconscious be very open to me, it wouldn’t have been called subconscious.</span> <span id="s515">There are certainly all kinds of engines moving me around when I paint.</span> <span id="s516">Some of them intentional, some of them I don’t know.</span> <span id="s517">Art is a big, big, big mystery.</span> <span id="s518">I mean, you can’t always say that much with that many words on top of it.</span> <span id="s519">I have no language that I really possess fully.</span> <span id="s520">All the languages that I use are kind of acquired languages or partly abandoned languages, because I don’t live in them.</span> <span id="s521">I picked them up when I was young.</span> <span id="s522">So only that much I can say.</span> <span id="s523">But then, once a painting is painted and it leaves my studio and it goes into the world, it has a life of its own.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">TRACK 10 – Return to Germany I became very fascinated by paintings of Durer.</span> <span id="s525">And I discovered that Durer was a child prodigy.</span> <span id="s526">There are some self portraits of Durer, done at the age of 14 or 15, and one of them is with a pillow near his head.</span> <span id="s527">And the pillow is as big as he is.</span> <span id="s528">And then there is another drawing of pillows only.</span> <span id="s529">Suddenly, this pillow that I had when left my home in Vilna came between Durer and myself.</span> <span id="s530">So this was a very, very, very strange thing.</span> <span id="s531">One of his most fascinating creations was this engraving called The Melancholia, where you can see an angel, a brooding angel, sitting among all kinds of objects.</span> <span id="s532">All of these objects had then, in that time of history, specific symbolic meanings.</span> <span id="s533">But what was mainly important for me in that image of the brooding angel in a world in which there is a rainbow, and the rainbow was a promise of God that there will be no other flood.</span> <span id="s534">And yet, there was a flood.</span> <span id="s535">The Second World War was a terrible flood.</span> <span id="s536">How did Durer already foresee that in there?</span> <span id="s537">I knew that when Durer made that, he was a man of the Renaissance.</span> <span id="s538">He believed that the world is moving from an era of darkness into an era of light.</span> <span id="s539">He believed that the Renaissance will be this age of enlightenment.</span> <span id="s540">I was a refugee of a world that moved from believing in enlightenment into a world of darkness.</span> <span id="s541">So somehow I felt an enormous affinity with that brooding angel who has no answer.</span> <span id="s542">I started to paint to some paintings.</span> <span id="s543">Because I created a triptych with the angel of Durer, and because I also painted the four evangelists, based on the painting of Durer, The Ground Under Their Feet, the German Institute of Studies of Durer, and the Durer Gesellschaft in Germany, and then finally the National Gallery in Nuremburg, decided to have an exhibition of my art.</span> <span id="s544">They invited me to show there.</span> <span id="s545">This was for me also maybe one of the first times I returned to Germany.</span> <span id="s546">I had to move from the hotel to the place where they opened my exhibition, and I felt almost like living through a dream, a nightmare, something very strange.</span> <span id="s547">It seemed to me kind of a troubling feeling.</span> <span id="s548">Are the Germans of today trying to show the world they have become good people and they are using me for that?</span> <span id="s549">But then what happened to me two days after that, is that I returned to that museum to have another look of my show.</span> <span id="s550">There I saw teachers with German children, all of them born after the war, and children that had to be taught what this country went through.</span> <span id="s551">Now I’m speaking of something that happened in the late 1970’s.</span> <span id="s552">And I realized that my paintings were a fantastic tool for these teachers, to let the children look at my paintings and say what they see and ask questions, and then the teachers were able to move from these questions and tell them about the upheaval that happened in their own country.</span> <span id="s553">At that time, I realized that something was already beginning here in the States with Facing History, this organization that is teaching teachers to teach the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s554">And I realize, although it was not planned, it was not a device that I had found, it was not something that I have kind of calculated, but my paintings became a tool of teaching.</span> <span id="s555">While young people may be shocked or even scared by photographic images of human bodies being pushed by a bulldozer into a mass grave, and they won’t like to know anything about it or hear anything about it, through my paintings, there is a way to approach tragedy that can also speak of the man who made these paintings and what happened to him.</span> <span id="s556">Somehow, it was really in Germany and seeing the German youth reacting to my paintings, then later on -- after my book was published more than 10 years ago, and then a few years ago, when it was translated into German, and it was presented at the book fair in Frankfurt, so I had a book tour of about a couple of weeks, in various German towns, with readings and speaking, and so on – yes, I felt it was an important document.</span> <span id="s557">My book, as well as my art, to speak of this enormous unsolved problem of how is it that people who have potentials of so much good, sometimes they use only the potentials of the bad, which are in them.</span> <span id="s558">I believe that finally in every human being there is that much good and that much bad, and then it depends on circumstances and on education, and on so many things which are beyond the individual’s control.</span> <span id="s559">Why some people choose this way, some people that way, and some people do not even have the choice.</span> <span id="s560">They are just pushed and made to do things that to us seem absolutely impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">STORYPRESERVATION INITITIAVE SAMUEL BAK TRANSCRIPTION TO RECORDING PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT 1</span></p></body></html>
