cooperate with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: As a boy, did you know of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Poland was a very extraordinary country, what people all over the world could not understand about Poland.</span> <span id="s55">Poland was a good country.</span> <span id="s56">The government went by the name, by the President, when was -- the name was Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s57">He was a very fine, extraordinary president for the people.</span> <span id="s58">The people, they -- I cannot say in general the people was bad people.</span> <span id="s59">We got good and bad ones in any nation.</span> <span id="s60">However, Poland went through a cataclysm, they always got the wars because they was in the middle between Russia and Germany and Austria, all the borders.</span> <span id="s61">And they always, every 20 years, every 40 years, always a revolution or war.</span> <span id="s62">Poland never got a chance to straighten out themself and to be original, really independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: But before the war, you had a pretty nice life?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">My father was a businessman, like I said.</span> <span id="s66">He was -- we were, all the kids they worked very hard.</span> <span id="s67">We never looked something for nothing.</span> <span id="s68">We was very independent.</span> <span id="s69">My father give away a lot of charity to Jewish organizations and Gentile organizations, alike.</span> <span id="s70">And about myself, I went to Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s71">This means Orthodox school.</span> <span id="s72">Later when I got older, I went to a Gentile school.</span> <span id="s73">I graduate from high school.</span> <span id="s74">After I graduate, my parents and myself, they try to send me to law school which I attended two years.</span> <span id="s75">After school, I was sitting in courthouse, and listen cases.</span> <span id="s76">I could not accomplish my mission because the Germans, they came and they destroy our life, our country, our families.</span> <span id="s77">For a while, I saved my parents, my brothers and sisters, before the war they left to France.</span> <span id="s78">And I was myself home, try to work older brother, with two older brothers, with Gustav and Baruch.</span> <span id="s79">Later the Nazis came, they occupied, because Szczecin was a strategic point close to the borders, the German borders.</span> <span id="s80">From us to Germany could be 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s81">Some areas was written, signs in stores was written in two languages: Polish and German.</span> <span id="s82">So tight we was close to the German borders.</span> <span id="s83">On September 8, I was in a spot they called this Chachiramia (ph).</span> <span id="s84">This was a street by the name like Beverly Hills, and all of a sudden -- I walk with a Gentile person, with our neighbor's son, and all of a sudden, came about approximately in my estimation is about 2 or 4,000 airplanes in the air.</span> <span id="s85">Very low and below was maybe 10,000 motorcycles on the bottom.</span> <span id="s86">And the airplanes, they tried to protect those motorcycles if maybe the opponents, they will fight back immediately.</span> <span id="s87">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s88">They went through.</span> <span id="s89">In three days or four days, they occupied all Poland.</span> <span id="s90">Later they -- Poland was divided.</span> <span id="s91">The Germans, they divided Poland in ghettos, in camps, and they make LÃ³dz was the biggest ghetto in the United States.</span> <span id="s92">Excuse me, in Poland.</span> <span id="s93">Pardon me, in Poland.</span> <span id="s94">Later they open up ghettos in every city, approximately in every city.</span> <span id="s95">A ghetto, to inform you better, is like this: They select six, seven streets, big streets, and they close up on both sides.</span> <span id="s96">And they concentrate all those people in this particular street, in those streets.</span> <span id="s97">And they have to live inside, sleep, and do work, undernourished.</span> <span id="s98">The minimum, very minimum amount food.</span> <span id="s99">And everything under terror.</span> <span id="s100">Mostly they got bottles would send and water.</span> <span id="s101">Bottles, regular bottles.</span> <span id="s102">If he don't like you face or he don't like you, he just bend you in half with a bottle of water or they send.</span> <span id="s103">You be dead on the spot.</span> <span id="s104">Maybe they take you out and they throw you away, we don't know where they put those people.</span> <span id="s105">This was the most barbarian time in 3,000 years.</span> <span id="s106">Never was something, what I saw for my own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What happened after the motorcycles and the airplanes, what happened to you next?</span> <span id="s108">Did you hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: The next step was the Germans in a month later, maybe three weeks later to recognize every Jew to be a Jew, and to terror -- to terrorize the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s110">So they put in a Star of David, a yellow Star of David, and this was the recognition, this you a Jew.</span> <span id="s111">Because I was a different Jew myself.</span> <span id="s112">A different Jew means some Jewish people, they gave up.</span> <span id="s113">I did not.</span> <span id="s114">I don't put on the Star of David, and I was mixed in with Gentiles.</span> <span id="s115">And they could not recognize me or I am a Jew or a Gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Wasn't that risky?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: This is dead on the spot, or I don't care.</span> <span id="s118">If I die, I die or I die as a Jew with pride.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: How did you know which Gentiles to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s121">There was a big station and a big, tremendous street to the station.</span> <span id="s122">Hitler came and hold a speech.</span> <span id="s123">Approximately, it was 10 or 15,000 people in this area, concentrate, listen to speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: This was later -- this was in December.</span> <span id="s126">It was cold.</span> <span id="s127">This is the reason I remember it was December.</span> <span id="s128">In Poland December is very cold, snow, rain, miserable days.</span> <span id="s129">I was standing with Germans shoulder with shoulder.</span> <span id="s130">He brought his group, the SA, SS, and I was standing there.</span> <span id="s131">They don't know I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s132">Nobody could recognize me because I was dressed and combed like a German.</span> <span id="s133">And I know the style because I was born in this area.</span> <span id="s134">I know how the Germans, they dress.</span> <span id="s135">How they do it.</span> <span id="s136">And I remember one phrase -- I speak German myself.</span> <span id="s137">Should I tell you the phrase?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: If you translate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I will translate you.</span> <span id="s140">Ven de lieber Gott (ph).</span> <span id="s141">If God help us in Poland, he will help us in France.</span> <span id="s142">This means he said in German, "God help us to occupy Poland.</span> <span id="s143">The next will be France."</span> <span id="s144">In his speech, this phrase.</span> <span id="s145">And I was standing arm and shoulder and shoulder in the middle.</span> <span id="s146">Nobody.</span> <span id="s147">As a matter of fact, some Germans, they just mumbling against those speeches.</span> <span id="s148">Those speech, what he was holding.</span> <span id="s149">They cannot talk.</span> <span id="s150">If he talk right away, he be in jail for 15 years or they shoot him on the spot, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s151">Or this is a Gentle, or Jew, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s152">This was their policy, nobody can be against me or against our system or against our program.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: What did it feel like being in this crowd?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: The feeling is just like they take somebody to the electric chair in a civilized country, and ten minutes before he get electrocuted they ask him, "What is your wish?"</span> <span id="s155">One guy said, "I'd like to hear a symphony."</span> <span id="s156">Another guy, he said, "I'd like to have a better meal," or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s157">What his desire is.</span> <span id="s158">My desire is to see how the Germans get back what they deserve, what they did to that civilized people all over the world.</span> <span id="s159">Anyhow, I tried to protect my one brother and his family.</span> <span id="s160">I lost everybody, they went to France and later I got no contact with them.</span> <span id="s161">I tried to help out because my brother, he was six feet and two inches tall, and he got four kids.</span> <span id="s162">And included my parents, my father and my mother, try put them in a separate spot.</span> <span id="s163">And I tried to hidden them maybe for nine months after I put them in a spot, in a room, of course.</span> <span id="s164">And I paid a Gentile money not to, you know.</span> <span id="s165">And I brought them food and whatever they need the most.</span> <span id="s166">And after this I got no choice no more.</span> <span id="s167">So I did before I lost them, there was big house, a big home with a big yard you could take in about 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s168">So they put in 2,000 Jewish families, singles, whatever it is, Jewish people, included my father.</span> <span id="s169">Got caught and they got them inside.</span> <span id="s170">My brother got inside.</span> <span id="s171">So I went -- let's see, this is the area over here where they concentrated 2,000.</span> <span id="s172">And the neighbor wall, so I work about night time between one and three o'clock in the morning, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s173">And I took out bricks -- you know, Europe houses, they build from bricks.</span> <span id="s174">So I took out the bricks, brick by brick, until I make a big hole.</span> <span id="s175">And I went inside and I put on Yuder, the Star of David.</span> <span id="s176">Because without a star, I could not go in.</span> <span id="s177">Not in, because not through the front doorwell, everybody can go in and out.</span> <span id="s178">So I make a hole, and I was inside.</span> <span id="s179">And you can imagine for your own eyes what's going on inside with those people.</span> <span id="s180">People automatically lost their mind.</span> <span id="s181">They lost their faith in life.</span> <span id="s182">They got nothing for one minute in mind, they will survive or they can live, or they let them live.</span> <span id="s183">So I took my father because every dead person who dies inside, they took them out in like a pushcart.</span> <span id="s184">So I took my father and make believe he's dead on the pushcart, and I got him out from the house.</span> <span id="s185">And I locate him in a spot; later I came to my brother, and I tried to get him out.</span> <span id="s186">And my brother, he was a very strong person.</span> <span id="s187">And I said, "Come on, I take you out.</span> <span id="s188">I got a spot, I take you out."</span> <span id="s189">He said, "I gave up.</span> <span id="s190">I gave up."</span> <span id="s191">And there was not too much time to convince him, "What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s192">And I got my father out, and him, he don't want to go out.</span> <span id="s193">And he was a big smoker, smoking.</span> <span id="s194">He said, "The only thing what you can do for me, bring me a cigarette.</span> <span id="s195">Bring me a cigarette, please.</span> <span id="s196">You save my life, bring me a cigarette."</span> <span id="s197">I said, "Come on out.</span> <span id="s198">I give you ten packages cigarette.</span> <span id="s199">Come on out."</span> <span id="s200">I try again and again and again.</span> <span id="s201">I could not convince him.</span> <span id="s202">And I got out my father, and I got out his wife with the kids.</span> <span id="s203">And he, no way; I could not convince him.</span> <span id="s204">And people so when I took out all those, my father and my sister-in-law with the kids, so they tried to do the same thing to get out from this.</span> <span id="s205">After this happened, I run away.</span> <span id="s206">Of course, let them do.</span> <span id="s207">The first three, four people I helped them out, to get out.</span> <span id="s208">Later I don't want to risk my head, and I went and I brought food for my sister-in-law with the kids and for my father with my mother.</span> <span id="s209">My mother start to be . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s210">[Interview stops here] End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So

Jews, I never know this, they exist, black Jews before the war.</span> <span id="s313">And I met him because he was visiting in France, and during the time he got caught by a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s314">And they send him like everything away.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: So you built -- you helped build a lot of camps in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Now, at this time were there any efforts for people like yourself to try to escape this?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Now, I will tell you a story.</span> <span id="s319">You remind me about escaping.</span> <span id="s320">From Funfteichen, I tried to escape, and one time I run away from the camp was between according to imagination was approximately 6 o'clock European time.</span> <span id="s321">And I walk, I never got shave.</span> <span id="s322">I look, you know, like a rabbi, and I wear stripes.</span> <span id="s323">This was -- I forgot.</span> <span id="s324">I give you a correction.</span> <span id="s325">Between a camp, Funfteichen -- between Funfteichen, grows rows and things like this.</span> <span id="s326">In Funfteichen, in Marx-Stadt, you wear clothing, plain clothing -- any clothing.</span> <span id="s327">When you went to concentration camp to Funfteichen, you went a uniform.</span> <span id="s328">They give you a uniform to recognize you, you a prisoner.</span> <span id="s329">You understand?</span> <span id="s330">Because we was builders, and over here in concentration already.</span> <span id="s331">This was the difference, the uniform, stripes.</span> <span id="s332">They called this a possack (ph), stripes blue and white, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s333">Now, where I am now?</span> <span id="s334">About run away.</span> <span id="s335">I run away 6 o'clock in the evening, and I came to a spot by myself.</span> <span id="s336">I came to a spot north, south, east, west, and I'm in the middle.</span> <span id="s337">And I said to myself, "What the hell should I do with myself?</span> <span id="s338">Where should I go?"</span> <span id="s339">Go this way, maybe I get caught over here.</span> <span id="s340">Maybe go south, they catch me over here.</span> <span id="s341">Till I see a little light, like from the mountains.</span> <span id="s342">You see a little light like a candle, candlelight.</span> <span id="s343">And I said to myself, "I take a chance.</span> <span id="s344">I go where the light is."</span> <span id="s345">When I came to the light, close to the light, so I knocked the door where the light is.</span> <span id="s346">Was an old lady, and she was knitting a sweater or whatever it is, and I ask her in this part they speak German.</span> <span id="s347">And I speak German, so I ask her, "Can you tell me where the police is over here?"</span> <span id="s348">When I asked her police, so she know I am not a criminal.</span> <span id="s349">Do you understand what I am talking to you?</span> <span id="s350">I ask her where are the police is over here, and they told me the police, you have to go over here two miles is the police, or three miles.</span> <span id="s351">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s352">She give me direction how to go.</span> <span id="s353">Wherever she go, I went the opposite.</span> <span id="s354">That road to the police, to get caught.</span> <span id="s355">When I went when she opened the door for me and she gave me the direction, so I asked her, "Maybe you have something to eat."</span> <span id="s356">She said, "I have no bread."</span> <span id="s357">I asked her for bread, and she said, "I have cake."</span> <span id="s358">Mostly, in Europe they bake, you know, cake.</span> <span id="s359">They call this in Czechish, the call this moksha (ph).</span> <span id="s360">In this area, they speak German and Czech, Slovakish.</span> <span id="s361">She said, "________________."</span> <span id="s362">"I have cake."</span> <span id="s363">I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s364">I never saw cake for five years.</span> <span id="s365">And she give me the cake.</span> <span id="s366">When she give me the cake, I said, "Can I have some water?"</span> <span id="s367">Everybody give you water.</span> <span id="s368">And I got water and cake.</span> <span id="s369">Later I start to be too fresh and I ask if she can give me a razor blade to just cut it up, the whole thing, and to run away further.</span> <span id="s370">She give me a razor blade, she was by herself.</span> <span id="s371">Later she got -- she was so nice to me.</span> <span id="s372">God should remember this woman.</span> <span id="s373">Later she said to me a story what happened with her.</span> <span id="s374">Her daughter's husband, he was an SS man, and he went to the army.</span> <span id="s375">All the families, they're for four years, five years in the army, and she hated Germans.</span> <span id="s376">You never believe it, they called this -- we was originally I was Sudeten-Deutschland.</span> <span id="s377">This is between Czechs and Germany.</span> <span id="s378">And they speak, you know, both languages.</span> <span id="s379">I spoke with her, and she was very nice.</span> <span id="s380">She give me a razor blades and everything.</span> <span id="s381">Later I said to myself, "I got a piece cake, and I got water, and I got a razor blade.</span> <span id="s382">The only solution to the problem, you better go back to the camp, because I get killed, I know."</span> <span id="s383">So I want you to listen with both ears this situation.</span> <span id="s384">All of a sudden, two more boys, they are run away from the camp, and I met those two guys.</span> <span id="s385">Till there was three; three is no good.</span> <span id="s386">Too many is no good.</span> <span id="s387">There was three.</span> <span id="s388">And all of a sudden, we came close, came a -- they called this an SI -- they got SS, they got the black over here, the storm troopers.</span> <span id="s389">And the other one was SA, was the yellow uniforms, a different uniform.</span> <span id="s390">And the guy came was just in yellow, a local guy.</span> <span id="s391">He came, "What the hell you guys doing over here?</span> <span id="s392">Where do you come from?"</span> <span id="s393">Told him we get out, we bandits.</span> <span id="s394">They got all -- I got shaved; they don't.</span> <span id="s395">So he said, "What kind nationality is?"</span> <span id="s396">One guy said, "I am Polish."</span> <span id="s397">The other guy said, "I am Lithuanian," whatever it is.</span> <span id="s398">When he came to me, I said, "I am a Jew."</span> <span id="s399">You have to excuse me, the guy who said Lithuanian, he said, "Put on the pants.</span> <span id="s400">Open the pants, put it on.</span> <span id="s401">I want to see are you circumcised."</span> <span id="s402">He wants to see, he knows they are Jewish people, they circumcised.</span> <span id="s403">When he did this, he saw the guys, they was circumcised.</span> <span id="s404">So they both, they told him a lie.</span> <span id="s405">He said he's a Ukrainian, or whatever it is, and I said I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s406">So he said to the guys, "Open your mouth."</span> <span id="s407">He killed them on the spot, both.</span> <span id="s408">Both they got killed.</span> <span id="s409">After the liberation, I went to looking for.</span> <span id="s410">Are they still, or they put him away?</span> <span id="s411">And because I told the truth, I am a Jew, I survived.</span> <span id="s412">They let me live because I don't lie to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: How did you know to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: How did your instincts tell you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: You know, this is a very long story to tell you how instinct.</span> <span id="s417">When you came to a situation, every creature, every human being, everything what is life, take a look at the guy got shot down with the airplane.</span> <span id="s418">The guy, for five days, he ate worms.</span> <span id="s419">Did you hear what the guy said on television?</span> <span id="s420">He ate worms, he got no food.</span> <span id="s421">He survived.</span> <span id="s422">Later they pick him up and they found him, and they brought him back.</span> <span id="s423">When you came to a situation like this, is no diplomacy.</span> <span id="s424">Is no knowledge, is no study.</span> <span id="s425">You could be educated, you could be the biggest idiot in -- the instinct for yourself dictate you what you should do.</span> <span id="s426">And this is life, nothing else.</span> <span id="s427">Not because I was smart or smarter than those two guys.</span> <span id="s428">I told him I am a Jew, I am not ashamed I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s429">In Marx-Stadt, I go back to Marx-Stadt, to my boss where I went to work, Dr. Visner.</span> <span id="s430">Till we got one foreman, a German, from the company, from Dr. Visner's company.</span> <span id="s431">He got a two-by-four stick, two-by-four, he could grab it, you know, and this.</span> <span id="s432">And one time he came to me.</span> <span id="s433">He said, "You was talking politic," to me.</span> <span id="s434">He slapped me in the face, and he report me and hit me in the head over here.</span> <span id="s435">You see over here?</span> <span id="s436">Can you see where he hit me?</span> <span id="s437">It was bloody, blood and everything, okay.</span> <span id="s438">Try to why he hit me, and I figured out forget it.</span> <span id="s439">Those work this way.</span> <span id="s440">In Marx-Stadt when you was -- our group was about, let's see, what we were productive is we make those cinder blocks.</span> <span id="s441">So was maybe eight or ten, a small group.</span> <span id="s442">In the morning when we left the gate, the guy put on number 1180.</span> <span id="s443">Numbers, you are number, not a name.</span> <span id="s444">Just a number.</span> <span id="s445">They put on the numbers.</span> <span id="s446">When you come back, you get the numbers back.</span> <span id="s447">And he registered, he see all the registered the same amount people, they don't run away or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s448">So the same guy who hit me with the two-by-fours, he report to the Ustachi (ph).</span> <span id="s449">Ustachi means the leader from the camp in Marx-Stadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Jewish or not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Jewish, not Jewish, was mixed.</span> <span id="s452">Or the guy, the leader, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s453">He got a leather jacket, a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s454">He looked like an SS man.</span> <span id="s455">Really -- a real animal.</span> <span id="s456">But this guy came, so this guy who hit me with the two-by-four, he report to the Ustachi.</span> <span id="s457">All the complaints go to the Ustachi, to this guy.</span> <span id="s458">So he got guys, kapos, whatever they receive complaints, they take them in and they put them on a bench.</span> <span id="s459">When I came in and the Ustachi, this guy, the first thing.</span> <span id="s460">Guilty or not guilty?</span> <span id="s461">No way, you are not going.</span> <span id="s462">First he slapped me in the face.</span> <span id="s463">I fall on the floor.</span> <span id="s464">The guy was a husky, strong guy.</span> <span id="s465">When I fell on the floor, he said -- I don't to mention the language what he said translate into English, because I will be embarrassed for a lady to say what he said.</span> <span id="s466">Something extraordinary language.</span> <span id="s467">So he said to those kapos, he said, "Pull down the pants.</span> <span id="s468">Open the pants.</span> <span id="s469">Pull down the pants.</span> <span id="s470">Lay down on the bench."</span> <span id="s471">They got a bench like this.</span> <span id="s472">And they gave me 50, how should I say it?</span> <span id="s473">I lost my language, my vocabulary.</span> <span id="s474">Fifty punches on my hinter.</span> <span id="s475">For your information, on the end I could not stand up.</span> <span id="s476">So he throw me down on the floor, lie down like a dog.</span> <span id="s477">They will not do this to a dog.</span> <span id="s478">And later he said, "Stand up, you bitch," you know.</span> <span id="s479">He said, "Stand up.</span> <span id="s480">Stand up.</span> <span id="s481">Stand up."</span> <span id="s482">And I can stand up and I stand up.</span> <span id="s483">My hinter, you have to excuse me, was -- how should I give you a description how it was?</span> <span id="s484">Ink, red ink, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s485">He said, you know, "Come tomorrow to work.</span> <span id="s486">You go on the company _______."</span> <span id="s487">This means on the phylactery, you know, they got a room.</span> <span id="s488">Lay down in the bed, and from this bed people who don't go to work, they send to Auschwitz, for your information.</span> <span id="s489">Because they need over here people to go to work, because this is a working camp, not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s490">A working camp.</span> <span id="s491">So I was two days -- a miracle was they don't send me to Auschwitz, and I went to work the third day.</span> <span id="s492">I was praying to God to go to work.</span> <span id="s493">When I came to work and the same guy who hit me with the two-by-four, he said, "You know what you did?</span> <span id="s494">You was listen illegal radio, news about the Germans, that they lost the war."</span> <span id="s495">I said, "I never -- how you got that idea?</span> <span id="s496">You could not even explain?</span> <span id="s497">You can't even talk?"</span> <span id="s498">He said he had to listen, nothing else.</span> <span id="s499">So this was the two experiences the direction run away and got killed two guys, and I survived.</span> <span id="s500">The guy, he came, he said I was listening to illegal radio about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: We was talk about politics, the Germans has to lose.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: But you didn't have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Positively no.</span> <span id="s505">This was a false thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: When you were in Funfteichen . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Funfteichen, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: . . . Funfteichen, excuse me, were you doing the same kind of work there that you had been doing when you started in Marx-Stadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: It's very hard to understand.</span> <span id="s510">A person like you to understand this.</span> <span id="s511">Marx-Stadt was a preliminary spot to build those camps for the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s512">We was a regular crew.</span> <span id="s513">Some, they was a group from roofers.</span> <span id="s514">Some was plumbers.</span> <span id="s515">I work in the cinder blocks, in concrete.</span> <span id="s516">Some was painters.</span> <span id="s517">Some was framers.</span> <span id="s518">Some was -- everybody got a different group, working group.</span> <span id="s519">So we was not dressed like concentration people.</span> <span id="s520">We was dressed civil clothing, and in concentration camp everybody got marks, stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: I understand that.</span> <span id="s522">Let's change tape while we . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: . . . what I want -- what we were talking about when we stopped is the difference between Marx-Stadt and Funfteichen.</span> <span id="s524">And what I understand is when you were then sent to Funfteichen because your work was done from the other camp, what you did every day in Funfteichen.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Daily routine things.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Like?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Every block, every block means every mobile home.</span> <span id="s528">Mobile home is easy to understand for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Well, you said barrack, it's a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Is a barrack, right.</span> <span id="s531">Everybody has 45, 50 people.</span> <span id="s532">This barrack has to clean the barrack, clean the landscaping.</span> <span id="s533">Looks beautiful for the delegations, to show how good they treat those people.</span> <span id="s534">How nice they lie to people.</span> <span id="s535">Everything is clean up.</span> <span id="s536">A million things.</span> <span id="s537">From Funfteichen, I was over a year.</span> <span id="s538">Then I went to Gross-Rosen in 1944.</span> <span id="s539">Gross-Rosen is an additional 45, 50 miles from this territory.</span> <span id="s540">So what they did, because the German feel, they get tighter with the war.</span> <span id="s541">The Russian, Americans, they don't let them breathe; 24 hours a day, every day 2 o'clock in the morning, you can see for yourself the lights.</span> <span id="s542">Because we was in shelters, but they bombard.</span> <span id="s543">So they throw it out to shelters, so they came and they line up all the areas and they saw people in uniforms.</span> <span id="s544">Didn't throw one bomb.</span> <span id="s545">They throw bombs just where they -- so this is not the camp.</span> <span id="s546">Well, I saw my eye 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, because I saw them.</span> <span id="s547">They run, boy, they light up like daylight.</span> <span id="s548">You could never believe this.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What were you thinking when you saw all these?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Later I start organize -- not officially -- step by step, groups.</span> <span id="s551">And I said to the guys, "Something is to the end."</span> <span id="s552">And they said -- some, they said, "Aah, you're dreaming.</span> <span id="s553">We finish sooner or later."</span> <span id="s554">Okay, if I see a guy, he lost the marbles and he never think about what will be the future with the Germans, I know.</span> <span id="s555">Because I believe in the Ten Commandments, this is in my heart, not in the Bible.</span> <span id="s556">Ten Commandments is my Bible, I believe.</span> <span id="s557">And I got this in mind.</span> <span id="s558">Got to come, the day must come -- this is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s559">This must come the day.</span> <span id="s560">At the end of '44, we start up '45, and we see they got it so smacked is after Gross-Rosen, we walk -- we sleep in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s562">You haven't told me anything about Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: In Gross-Rosen was a transit camp.</span> <span id="s564">No work, nothing doing.</span> <span id="s565">Wait for a transit.</span> <span id="s566">You understand transit, what it mean?</span> <span id="s567">Of a group to go.</span> <span id="s568">So they collect 500 or 1,000 groups walking, not travel.</span> <span id="s569">Because is no time, the Germans got no time to locate those people, because gets tougher and tougher and tougher for them.</span> <span id="s570">So from Gross-Rosen . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: So you were just there a short time?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: So I was maybe a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And this was in the beginning of 1945, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: In the beginning.</span> <span id="s575">End of '44, beginning of '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: So the biggest tragedy was in Gross-Rosen, do you know what they did?</span> <span id="s578">They took 3 or 4,000 people outside, and they count the people maybe nine times.</span> <span id="s579">They could not count it.</span> <span id="s580">They know how to count it to make people miserable.</span> <span id="s581">So we're standing about three hours counting: one, two, three, four, five, 5,000 people.</span> <span id="s582">You can imagine, and go back: one, two, three, four, five, six, and to count to 5,000.</span> <span id="s583">Cold, rain, snow, miserable.</span> <span id="s584">And you got the shoes, they got, you know, from the wooden -- they call this -- from wood.</span> <span id="s585">The sole was from wood.</span> <span id="s586">When you step in in snow, you got a popped up snow underneath, and this gets stiff.</span> <span id="s587">So you get -- you get not only crooked feet.</span> <span id="s588">You cannot walk.</span> <span id="s589">And later we sleep.</span> <span id="s590">Everybody when we left, the first thing we took was blanket.</span> <span id="s591">We took the blanket.</span> <span id="s592">You got a blanket, he got a blanket.</span> <span id="s593">So we took three blankets, three people.</span> <span id="s594">We covered up, and on the snow for three, for four, for five days.</span> <span id="s595">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s596">This was a short notice.</span> <span id="s597">And from Gross-Rosen, we went to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s598">In Buchenwald . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: How long -- I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s600">How long did it take you to walk there?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: To Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s602">I don't know, I really don't remember if we walk or we travel in those transportation wagons; I think we walk.</span> <span id="s603">I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: You were with a large group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Thousands.</span> <span id="s606">Thousands of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Did everyone make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: If you couldn't make it, he fall on the floor, and they pick him up and throw him away like another human being.</span> <span id="s609">Who know where?</span> <span id="s610">We came to Buchenwald, it was a big camp.</span> <span id="s611">Organized camp by nationalities.</span> <span id="s612">The French camp, the Polish camp, International camp and this.</span> <span id="s613">You could, in Buchenwald, you was flexible.</span> <span id="s614">I could go to the French camp and talk with the guys.</span> <span id="s615">No camp you could talk to -- from one camp, if you belong to this camp, you stay with this camp.</span> <span id="s616">You cannot talk to strangers or something else.</span> <span id="s617">In Buchenwald was -- maybe this was on the end.</span> <span id="s618">Because it gets closer, closer, closer.</span> <span id="s619">And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So there you could move around?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: And was it all men or were there women, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Was women in a separate shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: So where were you living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: In a

Buchenwald -- because my feeling is because this was the end.</span> <span id="s646">Very close to the end.</span> <span id="s647">Every night, every night you see hundreds of airplanes light up like the daytime, like over here.</span> <span id="s648">You could see everything.</span> <span id="s649">They don't throw one bomb on to, you know, to kill those -- they call us katsetlers (ph).</span> <span id="s650">This means the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s651">And until some people, they got free 1945 in May, and some people, they got free in April.</span> <span id="s652">Depended how the Germans, they call that.</span> <span id="s653">From Buchenwald -- wait a minute -- from Buchenwald, they pick up us and they ask who's professional people.</span> <span id="s654">So I said I

washrooms?</span> <span id="s671">Okay.</span> <span id="s672">They put in 25 guys naked, and the showers came from the ceiling, the showers.</span> <span id="s673">And one kapo, one animal or two, if you don't stay exactly what he says where it's supposed to be.</span> <span id="s674">So he throw dishes, wash dishes.</span> <span id="s675">Every dish we got hit in the head, you have to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s676">You got your head opened.</span> <span id="s677">Inside was really a massacre if you're going for the washroom.</span> <span id="s678">If you're going inside, you see something you never believe this in your life.</span> <span id="s679">How everything organized was, what the Nazis what they did to the civilization to people, to civilized people.</span> <span id="s680">After this you ask them what can work.</span> <span id="s681">We have to clean up the washroom.</span> <span id="s682">We have to make hot the water, which it never was.</span> <span id="s683">Cold water in winter.</span> <span id="s684">When you go in, you start to just shake like this, it's number one.</span> <span id="s685">Maybe they give you ten drops hot water.</span> <span id="s686">And you walk out, nothing to wipe up yourself.</span> <span id="s687">You just wait until you dry off yourself.</span> <span id="s688">They give you soap.</span> <span id="s689">The soap was so -- if you put on the soap, you got rashes all over.</span> <span id="s690">Who knows what a poison this was?</span> <span id="s691">Later when you have to clean up your block, your bed.</span> <span id="s692">You have to put in the blankets, and this everything is like under command.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did you have your own bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: You had your own part, though, or you shared?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Two, share.</span> <span id="s697">Two in one.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Were you aware of any resistance at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I really don't understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Was there any sort of underground or sabotage or anything like that there?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: In Buchenwald -- I want you to listen careful.</span> <span id="s702">In Buchenwald was a camp who people came from all over the world in this camp.</span> <span id="s703">Doctors, lawyers, artists, singers, players, orchestra, symphony players.</span> <span id="s704">I spoke with people like Jascha Heifetz.</span> <span id="s705">You know, guys like this type.</span> <span id="s706">_________, this type people.</span> <span id="s707">There was high -- Belgium painters.</span> <span id="s708">Not wall painters, paintings.</span> <span id="s709">High-class people, this was the concentrate everything.</span> <span id="s710">And from those people who knows the languages, they select and profession, they send to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s711">Why Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s712">Theresienstadt is located in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s713">In this area, they speak Czech, Slovakish and Germany.</span> <span id="s714">And they have kazzams.</span> <span id="s715">You know what a kazzam is?</span> <span id="s716">No.</span> <span id="s717">Kazzam is they have where they put the Americans over here.</span> <span id="s718">They have -- where they concentrate soldiers -- how they call this?</span> <span id="s719">My God, I start to be rusty, really.</span> <span id="s720">I forgot my vocabulary.</span> <span id="s721">Not kazzams.</span> <span id="s722">They take, you know -- let's see the National Guard.</span> <span id="s723">They concentrate, they got big, you know, for training and everything.</span> <span id="s724">For sleeping and everything.</span> <span id="s725">How they call this?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Like what?</span> <span id="s727">A military barracks, is this . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Not a military barracks.</span> <span id="s729">They don't call a barracks.</span> <span id="s730">They're called something else.</span> <span id="s731">If I don't find it, I look in the dictionary.</span> <span id="s732">I give you the word.</span> <span id="s733">So they got in Czechoslovakian Theresienstadt maybe 50 like this, 3,000 people, 4,000 people go in in a barrack like this.</span> <span id="s734">And they came from all nationalities.</span> <span id="s735">I came -- later when I came to Theresienstadt, I went to a hospital.</span> <span id="s736">And I told him, told -- the doctor said he needed an assistant.</span> <span id="s737">So I was his assistant, and people came from all over.</span> <span id="s738">And what is my assistant?</span> <span id="s739">I give my job what I got.</span> <span id="s740">They got a plate, and they put in all kind -- I don't believe it was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: . . . it wasn't any poison or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s742">People got diarrhea from this, whatever that -- so I was looking out from the window, and the Germans six, seven days before liberation, they went stiff and they march.</span> <span id="s743">And some people said we never, never could start a resistance against them.</span> <span id="s744">Never.</span> <span id="s745">Because how they loaded.</span> <span id="s746">Six days later, all of a sudden, we free.</span> <span id="s747">And everybody dance in the street, because Theresienstadt, they planning to make -- the Germans was planning to make oven like in Auschwitz, but they don't got the time to build this.</span> <span id="s748">They stop with soldiers.</span> <span id="s749">So after liberation on every corner like in the depression year, do you remember the American war was, in 1929 in the depression?</span> <span id="s750">On every corner they stand -- they give away soup with the bread, you know, to the people.</span> <span id="s751">They got no jobs and everything.</span> <span id="s752">This remind me of this.</span> <span id="s753">On every corner they're putting soup and bread and food after liberation.</span> <span id="s754">And a little boy, I saw from 12 years, he got a group maybe 800 Germans, they got caught.</span> <span id="s755">And he said to me -- command, a boy with a stick like a baseball bat and he said to them, "Open your shoes.</span> <span id="s756">One shoe wear and one shoe barefoot."</span> <span id="s757">So they went with one shoe, and he given the command and every guy who said one word, right away he hit him so badly this little guy, little boy.</span> <span id="s758">And I said, "Isn't this not a miracle?"</span> <span id="s759">Is a miracle how six days I was looking how they march, and all of a sudden, they dead forever.</span> <span id="s760">Later we came, the Americans came this way on ships.</span> <span id="s761">The Russians came this way.</span> <span id="s762">They kiss each other, embrace each other.</span> <span id="s763">And they brothers and sisters, and everybody dance in the streets and everything.</span> <span id="s764">Because Theresienstadt was a group mostly German Jews, primarily.</span> <span id="s765">They concentrate because they speak Germany, and the most intellectuals from all over the world, they sent like from Buchenwald and to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s766">And this -- after this, we got liberated, till I met my sweetheart.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s768">I want to hear all about this, but I got to stop you, because I have a lot of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s770">Ask me all questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I lost the day anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s774">So you were in Buchenwald a

diarrhea.</span> <span id="s790">Have no medication to stop this, to do this.</span> <span id="s791">And in Theresienstadt, they send all the old clothing.</span> <span id="s792">What they steal from all over the world, they sent to Theresienstadt and they put it in storage.</span> <span id="s793">Later the people came.</span> <span id="s794">One got a shirt, one got a pair of pants.</span> <span

Teresa after they put her in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1009">We were with a group, and the group was -- this group was half Jews and half Gentiles.</span> <span id="s1010">Mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s1011">She was Jewish, he was a Gentile.</span> <span id="s1012">She was a Gentile, he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1013">Groups like this.</span> <span id="s1014">Maybe five couples.</span> <span id="s1015">The one lady who the Nazis beat them up and kill them, and she and her mother and a son, they live in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1016">Not in the camp.</span> <span id="s1017">I was at the camp.</span> <span id="s1018">I considered I met this woman, and she got really a crush on me.</span> <span id="s1019">She liked to marry me.</span> <span id="s1020">I -- you know, those days is my mind was all mine, to see my brothers and sisters and maybe some from the family.</span> <span id="s1021">And who got in health is something in my mind.</span> <span id="s1022">But she was an extraordinary, cultured person.</span> <span id="s1023">Very educated.</span> <span id="s1024">She was playing the piano and I played the piano.</span> <span id="s1025">So we was playing the piano together, she invite me to her mother -- to her mother's house in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1026">And her mother, she just speak Czechoslovak.</span> <span id="s1027">In Czech, I am good, I am not so good, but I understand every conversation I could have with her mother.</span> <span id="s1028">And her mother, she was to me like a mother, honest, the old lady.</span> <span id="s1029">I am talking about Lena.</span> <span id="s1030">Anyhow, my friend, he said he was crazy about her.</span> <span id="s1031">And she was a person to be really crazy, believe me, she was a very nice person.</span> <span id="s1032">And she told me the story about what happened with her husband, Jewish husband.</span> <span id="s1033">The Nazis came and they know he is Jewish, and they start up with him and they kill him.</span> <span id="s1034">They take him away, and they got a son, Peter, and Peter camel she came with her son.</span> <span id="s1035">So I said to her, "You know, Lena," her name was Lena.</span> <span id="s1036">So I said to Lena, "If I go to the United States, you go with me.</span> <span id="s1037">You cannot go without us."</span> <span id="s1038">And they came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1039">She came to the United States and her son.</span> <span id="s1040">Her son went into the Air Force, he was in the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1041">And she was -- she did fashion design, very creative person.</span> <span id="s1042">And my friend, he die for her, and he married her.</span> <span id="s1043">When he marry her, the mother, she was in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1044">She left her mother.</span> <span id="s1045">Later she promised by any situation, maybe we take the mother over here to the United States.</span> <span id="s1046">She was in, let's see, about in the '70s.</span> <span id="s1047">Maybe a little better.</span> <span id="s1048">And Lena, she visited her mother twice, and came back to the United States.</span> <span id="s1049">And her mother, she said she will stay in Czechoslovakia, in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1050">Peter, her son, we was ready to adopt him.</span> <span id="s1051">He was so nice, as my son.</span> <span id="s1052">Honest, what a kid that he was.</span> <span id="s1053">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1054">But when I was in Theresienstadt and she told me what the Nazis did to him.</span> <span id="s1055">So I said, Give me the names.</span> <span id="s1056">I get even with those guys who did to your husband."</span> <span id="s1057">She said, "They got arrested before."</span> <span id="s1058">Some neighbors, Gentile neighbors, they pointed out this guy, he was another Hitler, a guy, type like this.</span> <span id="s1059">And I don't know what, they took him away and I went, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1060">Later this was Lena, this story.</span> <span id="s1061">Later I went to the kazzam, it was a Hungarian kazzam.</span> <span id="s1062">Hungarians, they have a language like Gypsies.</span> <span id="s1063">Very yak, yak, yak, yak -- is very, very tough language.</span> <span id="s1064">I walk in and they told me.</span> <span id="s1065">I said, "What kind of language you speak over here?"</span> <span id="s1066">They said, "________________."</span> <span id="s1067">I said, "They got to be Hungarian."</span> <span id="s1068">Nobody else.</span> <span id="s1069">I asked and they told me they're Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1070">They all almost naked after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Winter.</span> <span id="s1073">About 3 or 4,000, these Hungarians, they all made it for this purpose.</span> <span id="s1074">And like _________, without her, I met few women and ask, "Do you have son at Polish lady by your name, Esther?"</span> <span id="s1075">She said -- one woman said, "I met a Polish woman over here."</span> <span id="s1076">"Can you bring the woman over here?"</span> <span id="s1077">She said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1078">Because I could not even go in.</span> <span id="s1079">My heart was broken how those people after liberation.</span> <span id="s1080">Few days, few days she brought and this was my godmother.</span> <span id="s1081">I almost got a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1082">In those days, they didn't even know what a heart attack means.</span> <span id="s1083">Today I can assure you, I got a heart attack when this happen.</span> <span id="s1084">And I see my mother, how she look.</span> <span id="s1085">I said, "What a _______ fighter.</span> <span id="s1086">You sit over here.</span> <span id="s1087">I will be back in an hour.</span> <span id="s1088">I bring you clothing, dresses and everything."</span> <span id="s1089">So asked Lena in Czechoslovakian, in Theresienstadt in the city who was in the haberdasher stores, who was in the clothing.</span> <span id="s1090">Who was this, who was this?</span> <span id="s1091">And she told me this woman, they was in the clothing business.</span> <span id="s1092">They have dresses, ladies' dresses.</span> <span id="s1093">Everything is hidden.</span> <span id="s1094">Everything, you know, after the war, they put us in cellars, in the walls of the building, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1095">So I go in, I said, "Lady, I would like to have two, four dresses."</span> <span id="s1096">She said, "God forbid.</span> <span id="s1097">My God, ___________.</span> <span id="s1098">We have nothing.</span> <span id="s1099">We lost everything.</span> <span id="s1100">We poor people.</span> <span id="s1101">We got nothing."</span> <span id="s1102">And she said, "____________."</span> <span id="s1103">She's a 10 percent Jewish, she told me.</span> <span id="s1104">Everybody after the war, they start to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1105">Everybody was.</span> <span id="s1106">I said, "Look, I am talking to you nice.</span> <span id="s1107">You got hidden the dresses.</span> <span id="s1108">If you don't give me four or five dresses, I can assure you'll be dead over here in 10 minutes from now.</span> <span id="s1109">Right now, I want the dresses."</span> <span id="s1110">She listened -- dead.</span> <span id="s1111">She said, "Maybe I look, maybe I can find it.</span> <span id="s1112">Maybe I can look."</span> <span id="s1113">She goes downstairs in the cellar.</span> <span id="s1114">Loaded with clothing, boxes with this hidden in this here.</span> <span id="s1115">She give me five dresses.</span> <span id="s1116">Then I want underwear.</span> <span id="s1117">She brought me everything what a woman need.</span> <span id="s1118">Panties and these, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1119">And I brought it to my mother, and I said, "Go at."</span> <span id="s1120">Later I talk with here.</span> <span id="s1121">"How do you survive?</span> <span id="s1122">In this age, how you survive?"</span> <span id="s1123">And she told me, "You know, Dave, what I did?</span> <span id="s1124">I tell how I survive?</span> <span id="s1125">I took a brick, brick from the house.</span> <span id="s1126">And take two bricks and make powder and put in a rouge on my face to look 20 years younger.</span> <span id="s1127">And I make this and I make this."</span> <span id="s1128">And she explained to me.</span> <span id="s1129">I said, "Look, I don't you be over here, not even one minute.</span> <span id="s1130">You go with me right now."</span> <span id="s1131">I took her out, and she rest a week.</span> <span id="s1132">Later she went to the kitchen to work in the kitchen as a manager.</span> <span id="s1133">She worked as a supervisor/manager, they don't know manager.</span> <span id="s1134">Supervise in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1135">So she work for a while until we got established, because Lena, the lady, she was a local person.</span> <span id="s1136">And she knows very well, later they establish rules and regulations, you could not say you kill if you don't give me this.</span> <span id="s1137">This was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1138">Later I expect my brother.</span> <span id="s1139">My brother, my older brother, he got life.</span> <span id="s1140">After the liberation, I went to friends, and they told me is living, he is in Morocco.</span> <span id="s1141">When he came back and I left him, a sign, your brother we never knew each other almost.</span> <span id="s1142">I was a little kid, and he was the older brother.</span> <span id="s1143">So he say he came to me.</span> <span id="s1144">Later we went to Landsberg am Lech, we all the group let them go to hell.</span> <span id="s1145">We will stay over here.</span> <span id="s1146">The whole thing is with blood, with tears, whatever they -- so we went to Landsberg am Lech where Hitler wrote his Mein Kampf, the book.</span> <span id="s1147">Are you familiar with this?</span> <span id="s1148">You know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s1149">He wrote Mein Kampf, the book, Hitler.</span> <span id="s1150">In Landsberg am Lech, I went to the chaplain in Germany, and I said, "Chaplain, I would like to have a place to live.</span> <span id="s1151">I got my mother over here.</span> <span id="s1152">I got my mother's daughter, my godmother's daughter with me.</span> <span id="s1153">I got Lena, I got a bunch, a group with names and everything."</span> <span id="s1154">So he give me two bedrooms and a kitchen and a house and maybe 25 feet -- maybe 50 feet where they put old Goering, Goebbels, all those to death.</span> <span id="s1155">They got shot in Landsberg am Lech.</span> <span id="s1156">Where they took the group and they kill them, and we was almost see how they did to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: But the house you were living in is near that; is that what you're saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: The house you were living in was near that; is that what you're telling me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: The house we live in in Landsberg am Lech, all this -- you know, in the Bible, in the Bible is written Abraham's house was a house for the hungry, for the naked, for the poor.</span> <span id="s1161">Everybody who go in in Abraham's house, he got a meal and clothing and dress and everything.</span> <span id="s1162">Our house was Abraham's house.</span> <span id="s1163">Everybody came, we feed them, we dress them.</span> <span id="s1164">We do everything what we can do.</span> <span id="s1165">This was in Landsberg am Lech.</span> <span id="s1166">Landsberg am Lech, I'll give you the translation.</span> <span id="s1167">Landsberg is the city, the name.</span> <span id="s1168">Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1169">On the Elbe, on the lake.</span> <span id="s1170">So when I was after the liberation, I just butt in right now into something else.</span> <span id="s1171">After liberation I was looking for my family in Germany.</span> <span id="s1172">In Germany I could not find them, nobody.</span> <span id="s1173">So I went to France, because I knew my family live in France.</span> <span id="s1174">So my brother was in a camp -- my two brothers were in camp.</span> <span id="s1175">My sister was in camp, the younger sister.</span> <span id="s1176">And after the liberation, she died, and those two brothers, they survived.</span> <span id="s1177">My brother, the older brother, he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1178">And the other brother, he was in the financing business as far as I remember in mind what is.</span> <span id="s1179">So I left a note with a guy, so I came to France in the name Metz, M-e-t-z in Ludwigshafen.</span> <span id="s1180">This is between the German border and the French borders.</span> <span id="s1181">I came, I took a trip, was a long trip.</span> <span id="s1182">Maybe 24 hours, and I go in and was a guy, a shoe shine man who, you know, who shines shoes.</span> <span id="s1183">In the street, they got a stand.</span> <span id="s1184">And he block hats, he finish up hats.</span> <span id="s1185">In Europe, they use hats, men.</span> <span id="s1186">So I go up to the guy and I said, "Monsieur, ______________?"</span> <span id="s1187">He said, "You can speak to me German, because your French is broken."</span> <span id="s1188">I said, "I get by with my French.</span> <span id="s1189">I just start up with you.</span> <span id="s1190">Do you know a family in Metz, Morris Davidovicz?"</span> <span id="s1191">He said, "Morris Davidovicz, they were richest people in the Metz."</span> <span id="s1192">My brother -- which is true.</span> <span id="s1193">He know my brother, all the brothers and the sisters, this guy.</span> <span id="s1194">They always took shoe shines with the guys.</span> <span id="s1195">They know everything, you know, those guys.</span> <span id="s1196">So I was not successful.</span> <span id="s1197">I said, "Do you me a favor.</span> <span id="s1198">I give you my name and address and telephone in Germany where I was located, where I am now.</span> <span id="s1199">I am in Landsberg am Lech.</span> <span id="s1200">If they return, with God's will, I want you to tell them to come.</span> <span id="s1201">I do everything for them.</span> <span id="s1202">I pay them everything what they wanted in this."</span> <span id="s1203">He came.</span> <span id="s1204">When he came back about, let's see, about six weeks later, my brother came to my godmother's house.</span> <span id="s1205">And they came and everybody, we was in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1206">There was about maybe 4,000 Jews, a Jewish camp, a free camp.</span> <span id="s1207">Like bungalows, they got bungalows, they have mobile homes.</span> <span id="s1208">You know, people live private.</span> <span id="s1209">No more on the Nazis', you know, stuff free.</span> <span id="s1210">And they said to me, "Dave, your brother's over here from France."</span> <span id="s1211">I said, "You're crazy.</span> <span id="s1212">What?"</span> <span id="s1213">And we was on the second floor, a two-story building.</span> <span id="s1214">I don't know how I went.</span> <span id="s1215">I think I fly, how I came down.</span> <span id="s1216">I don't remember I walk with the steps, so anxious I was to see my brother.</span> <span id="s1217">I look on my brother, he look like my mother.</span> <span id="s1218">One piece, I don't him.</span> <span id="s1219">I really don't know him.</span> <span id="s1220">I really don't know him.</span> <span id="s1221">Maybe I was maybe four years old.</span> <span id="s1222">How can I recognize a person so many years?</span> <span id="s1223">I said, "Morris, what language you speak?"</span> <span id="s1224">He said, "Three languages.</span> <span id="s1225">I speak French, I speak Jewish and I speak Germany."</span> <span id="s1226">And I start talking to him, and he said to me, "Who survived from the mishpocha, from the family?"</span> <span id="s1227">Mishpocha is in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1228">"Who survive from the family?"</span> <span id="s1229">He said, "Me and Gustav."</span> <span id="s1230">"What happened my sisters, Bella, Frencha, Freda?</span> <span id="s1231">What happened with them?"</span> <span id="s1232">At the last minute, the Nazis, they send them to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1233">They never show up back.</span> <span id="s1234">We cry with this and this.</span> <span id="s1235">So he said to me, "Dave, I want you do for me one thing.</span> <span id="s1236">One thing.</span> <span id="s1237">I need a pair of glasses.</span> <span id="s1238">I cannot see.</span> <span id="s1239">I'm looking on the look.</span> <span id="s1240">I lost my vision and everything."</span> <span id="s1241">I said, "I give you a pair of glasses."</span> <span id="s1242">I went to people who tipped me off who was the optometrist, whatever it is, in the eyeglasses' business.</span> <span id="s1243">They have the Germans.</span> <span id="s1244">They don't have nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s1245">They cry we have nothing.</span> <span id="s1246">I said, "Look, don't you go out and tell me you don't have nothing.</span> <span id="s1247">I know you got in cellar, and you better give it to me right away."</span> <span id="s1248">And I went down and the guy came, and he give.</span> <span id="s1249">He went and when he put on the glasses, he said, "God, you bring me new eyes.</span> <span id="s1250">I never forget you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: I'll tell you when.</span> <span id="s1252">You wanted to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: I apologize to you in this story about Theresienstadt, I left out a very important romance with my wife.</span> <span id="s1254">I walk in Theresienstadt myself, and I was thinking about my future.</span> <span id="s1255">How to organize my own life, and what will be the next step?</span> <span id="s1256">I saw a lady standing in a spot where they supply clothing to the poor people and to average people, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1257">So I said to her, "Can you tell me, lady, what time is now?"</span> <span id="s1258">And she said to me, she give me about 10 o'clock, whatever, 11 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1259">I said, "You look so familiar to me."</span> <span id="s1260">And she said, "Yes, do we know each other?"</span> <span id="s1261">She said, "Can you tell me your name?"</span> <span id="s1262">And she said, "I came from LÃ³dz."</span> <span id="s1263">LÃ³dz is a city in Poland.</span> <span id="s1264">"My father was a textile engineer by the name _______ __________."</span> <span id="s1265">In Polish __________ ___________.</span> <span id="s1266">Translate in English Brauder Shagossi (ph).</span> <span id="s1267">After she told me the name, I said, "You know, this name sound to me so in my ears, I think I know somebody in your family."</span> <span id="s1268">She said, "Maybe."</span> <span id="s1269">"Do you have somebody, a cousin or somebody, an uncle by the name Shagossi, who make special material for special raincoats -- a special material for raincoats?"</span> <span id="s1270">She said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1271">From here we start up a conversation, and we talk and later we talk about movies and this and a million things until we get acquainted.</span> <span id="s1272">And I got really -- how you say -- a crunch?</span> <span

id="s1276">And I told her my education, what we did and everything.</span> <span id="s1277">She said she's going to Landsberg am Lech.</span> <span id="s1278">I said, "So am I." "Why you going to Landsberg am Lech?"</span> <span id="s1279">to her.</span> <span id="s1280">She said, "I'm looking for my brother.</span> <span id="s1281">I got the only brother, and I was told he is in Landsberg am Lech."</span> <span id="s1282">Now, I went straight out for you, maybe you don't know this.</span> <span id="s1283">After liberation, Germany was divided in four zoning: American zone, English zone, French zone and Russian zone.</span> <span id="s1284">She live later -- she was on the English zone and I live on the American zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q:

Landsberg together first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: First, we went to Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1294">From Landsberg, she was on the American side with me.</span> <span id="s1295">We lived separate, we didn't live together.</span> <span id="s1296">This against my principle, against my religions to live with a person if I'm not married.</span> <span id="s1297">So the lady, she says, "You know, Dave, with all respect to you, I like you very much, and are we very serious both.</span> <span id="s1298">But I am looking for my brother.</span> <span id="s1299">This is the only brother, and I was told he is alive."</span> <span id="s1300">So her brother was on the English side, they call this Hannover, the city in Germany.</span> <span id="s1301">Hannover.</span> <span id="s1302">From Hannover, he went to Bergen-Belsen, the big camp in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1303">So she found her brother.</span> <span id="s1304">When she found her brother, and I was lonely myself and I was very anxious to meet her.</span> <span id="s1305">I think she run away from me approximately was maybe seven weeks, maybe two months we got separate.</span> <span id="s1306">Separated each other.</span> <span id="s1307">So we was very grateful, thank God she got her brother, and later I went to visit her.</span> <span id="s1308">I got a camera with me, they stole that camera on the trip what I made because this is between 1,700 or 1,800 miles.</span> <span id="s1309">When you came from one zoning to the other one, you have to have document.</span> <span id="s1310">So they came to me,

<span id="s1334">But this was my job to advise them.</span> <span id="s1335">You have to go over here, this is located in Poland.</span> <span id="s1336">This is far from here, because all those kids

said -- the principal, I don't say you should abolish or liquidate the language what you know, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1479">If you will learn quick and nice and good English, you have to do this way.</span> <span id="s1480">If you read it, rain, shine, snow -- we went to school.</span> <span id="s1481">She went to college, and I went to the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q:

id="s1497">Throughout all of this period of time, was religion important to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Religious -- I am a religious person, and I believe in the Ten Commandments.</span> <span id="s1499">You don't have to read the five book of Moses.</span> <span id="s1500">You don't have to read -- because some people, they think if they know about the five book of Moses, they got the Bible and they are religious.</span> <span id="s1501">They go to church, the synagogue -- wrong from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1502">In the Jewish tradition, we got more than hundreds of books with commentaries about the religious.</span> <span id="s1503">My religion is the Ten Commandments.</span> <span id="s1504">If you obey the Ten Commandments, you're the most ethical person on the globe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: So this is what carried you through, or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: This kept my faith, my Jewishness and my religious, the Ten Commandments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: You mentioned a few things that when you came over here, you had to work, you had to learn English.</span> <span id="s1508">Was it difficult to start over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Very hard.</span> <span id="s1510">But, you see, my languages -- my languages, what I possess, the high-fidelity English, if they speak, I can understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: But in what other ways was it difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Difficulties a job.</span> <span id="s1513">You have to realize I work for 50 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s1514">Not because they took advantage of me, because I was a refugee or I was a foreigner.</span> <span id="s1515">No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1516">I deserve 50 cents an hour because what I did, the 50 cents an hour was to get acquainted with work, the system what they had.</span> <span id="s1517">I did things what I never did.</span> <span id="s1518">I polished pencils.</span> <span id="s1519">I start with 50 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s1520">Later the boss -- after three months, he want me to make manager.</span> <span id="s1521">Because those guys, they make five dozens; I make 10 dozens.</span> <span id="s1522">They make five dozens; I make 15 dozens, what I did.</span> <span id="s1523">So right away, I got guts to go into the boss.</span> <span id="s1524">I said, "I cannot work for 50 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s1525">I got a little baby, and I got a wife."</span> <span id="s1526">He said, "I give you 75."</span> <span id="s1527">And he start up, you know, the guy speak Jewish, was a Jewish foreman.</span> <span id="s1528">And he said, "The greenhorn," I don't want to say what he said.</span> <span id="s1529">Something else.</span> <span id="s1530">"The greenhorn.</span> <span id="s1531">He just came.</span> <span id="s1532">He like to have right away a lot of money."</span> <span id="s1533">I said, "Look, I need money because," in Jewish because I could have a conversation with the guy.</span> <span id="s1534">And I told him.</span> <span id="s1535">Two weeks later, I want a dollar, because I know I deserve.</span> <span id="s1536">He said, "It's too bad.</span> <span id="s1537">If you cannot make by this."</span> <span id="s1538">They like to make me foreman.</span> <span id="s1539">They offer me $5 an hour in this place.</span> <span id="s1540">Can you imagine this?</span> <span id="s1541">In eight months.</span> <span id="s1542">I accept.</span> <span id="s1543">Later I look for a different job.</span> <span id="s1544">Culture job, job what I know best.</span> <span id="s1545">I was in printing lithography and four-color separation.</span> <span id="s1546">War is the biggest criminal for people who make the war.</span> <span id="s1547">They should be punished because they provoke and they organize the wars, is the number one.</span> <span id="s1548">After this what happened in Hitler's time, after 50 years, no improvement.</span> <span id="s1549">We got the Ku Klux Klan.</span> <span id="s1550">We got militias.</span> <span id="s1551">They kill senators, congressmen, policeman, everybody.</span> <span id="s1552">Is no law and order and they don't get what they deserve.</span> <span id="s1553">We have to bring America to culture, to rehabilitate those criminals to make them people.</span> <span id="s1554">All the jails, they full with criminals with raping, no respect for women, no respect for kids.</span> <span id="s1555">Women classified as second citizens.</span> <span id="s1556">They never was in the history in a country, what they do.</span> <span id="s1557">And this has to be stopped once forever.</span> <span id="s1558">We don't want no more concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1559">We don't -- we have to go to basic to bring America -- and history, if they bring America to this tradition what America is supposed to be, there will be no more concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1560">The history will recognize American -- what America supposed to be and what our Constitution said what the citizen, every citizen, should benefit from America because everybody deserve the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">USHMM
