and I am at the home of Mr. Fred Raymes in Huntington, Long Island, New York.</span> <span id="s4">I’m here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview Mr. Raymes about his experiences and his recollections of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s5">Good morning, Mr. Raymes.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Hello.</span> <span id="s7">How are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Fine.</span> <span id="s9">How are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Feel like remembering?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Not really, but I’ll give it a try.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s14">When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in February 6, 1929 on a very cold day I’m told.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s17">And where?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: In a little village called Hoffenheim near Heidelberg in the province of Baden.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Supposedly it’s a nice area.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Well, it….</span> <span id="s23">I returned there recently and I was surprised how charming it is.</span> <span id="s24">Yes, I must admit, it is very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Do you have any memories of growing up in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s27">I remember a lot of things.</span> <span id="s28">I lived there until I was ten or eleven years old so I have a lot of good -- eh -- a lot of memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">I have one brother named Menachem.</span> <span id="s32">He currently lives in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And he was the younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: He was younger by three years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And how about your parents?</span> <span id="s36">Can you tell us something about your parents?</span> <span id="s37">Who they were, what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s39">Well, my mother was a typical housewife of its day.</span> <span id="s40">My father was in business as a butcher.</span> <span id="s41">And they tried to make a living to support us as long as they managed to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Your father was a butcher in Humfenheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Did you live in an apartment or your own house?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well we lived in an apartment and then as a sort of -- because the Jewish community was very small there, on the time we were deported there was as few as ten families, my father acted as a cantor.</span> <span id="s46">When the regular cantor left or died, I’m not sure, we ended up in an apartment which was adjoining to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s47">So we lived there until the Kristallnacht when, of course, the synagogue was destroyed and we had to move out of the apartment very quickly.</span> <span id="s48">We moved in with an uncle who lived in that same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So you lived in three different apartments in a short period?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, as I can remember, it was over a ten -year period.</span> <span id="s51">-</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So your father’s butcher shop, that was separate, away from the apartment buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yeah, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Both of your parents were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Were they Reform, or Conservative, or Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Gee, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s58">But I think it’s a typical German traditional, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Most likely Conservative?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I don’t believe we ate kosher in the latter years.</span> <span id="s61">It may well be that in early years we were but I’m really not aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Do you remember what these apartments were like that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Not in any great detail.</span> <span id="s64">I -- the only vague memory I have is when I was perhaps three years old, and I believe it was about the time my brother was born.</span> <span id="s65">I remember very vividly a mouse playing under his crib, that I kept watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: A real mouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: A real mouse.</span> <span id="s68">And that’s about all I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: And he wasn’t your pet mouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span> <span id="s71">I don’t know where the mouse came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you have any pets?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, I didn’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Hobbies?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s76">By the time I, you know, 1933 was not very far away, I was four years old, and the little kids in the street very quickly stopped playing with us and would rather beat us up, so there was very little time for hobbies.</span> <span id="s77">It was more a question of protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did any of the kids ever beat you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Oh yeah, quite frequently and I learned to run as fast as my little legs could carry me.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: You mentioned that there were very few Jews in this town and I imagine half of them were relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s82">I think we, my brother and I, and another girl were the only children that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And you had at least one uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes, but he didn’t live in that same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s88">Did you ever get to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s90">I started school when I was six, which I guess means 1935, and went to school for about two years, till --- or perhaps it was three, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s91">No, it was two years.</span> <span id="s92">Till they prohibited Jewish kids from going to the public schools.</span> <span id="s93">And I was then enrolled in a Jewish operated school in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s94">And every morning I had to get up about six and take a train all by myself to go to Heidelberg and in the evening I returned home.</span> <span id="s95">I did this for one or two years, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I think that school closed.</span> <span id="s96">One or two years, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How was it like going to school as one of the few Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: I don’t have very much memory of the school, except that there was a lot of persecution.</span> <span id="s99">I was asked to leave the room when they talked about Nazi indoctrination, which of course made us little Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb.</span> <span id="s100">And of course, whenever the kids could catch me they would either push me into the --- some --- the embankment that fell up from the road, or beat me up otherwise --- anything they could do.</span> <span id="s101">Recently, I returned to Germany.</span> <span id="s102">This is an aside.</span> <span id="s103">And the seminary student, who is 28 years old wrote a thesis on the life of the Jewish community in this town.</span> <span id="s104">And he found a lot of details about the history of the community, and myself and my family, and so on.</span> <span id="s105">Things that I didn’t know, I had forgotten.</span> <span id="s106">And, in fact, he found my school records.</span> <span id="s107">And I had forgotten all my grades, but I can tell you they were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: You were a terrible student?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, it’s not surprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Or, how did the teachers treat you?</span> <span id="s111">That was my next question, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: How what?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: How did the teachers treat you?</span> <span id="s114">Sometimes people had terrible grades but they were good students.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s116">I think all the teachers were Nazis, ultimately.</span> <span id="s117">Otherwise I don’t think they could teach.</span> <span id="s118">And I think as long as he had to put up with me he did, and when I was prohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s119">But I was surprised to find my grades after about 50 years, you know.</span> <span id="s120">Wasn’t particularly paramount on my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: No.</span> <span id="s122">Even then.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I have the piece of paper, if you want to look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: That piece, his thesis, oh, the book, the research.</span> <span id="s125">That would be interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: It’s quite amazing.</span> <span id="s127">It’s quite an experience to meet these Germans.</span> <span id="s128">In fact, it’s something I’d like to talk to you about later.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: The rest of the town, were they, uh, was it more of a Protestant town or a Catholic town?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I don’t know what the percentages was, but I have the impression it was maybe 80/20 Protestant, but I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s131">There was one church each, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Did you have any, I hesitate to say friends, but any non-Jewish acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s134">I don’t remember really playing with any particular kids.</span> <span id="s135">When you ask that question, the image comes to mind of the first funeral I went to.</span> <span id="s136">One of the non-Jewish kids died of something and the whole class, I was still in the public school, went to the funeral.</span> <span id="s137">The first time I’ve ever been in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s138">And I vividly remember the open grave and the casket in it and every kid was supposed to go by and drop a flower on top of this casket.</span> <span id="s139">And I was so scared, I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s140">That’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s141">Now whether this kid was a particular friend of mine, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s142">I don’t have any vivid memory of ever really playing, or really having a good time to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s143">I, or perhaps I and my brother, but my brother was so much younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked.</span> <span id="s144">I remember the streets were full of pretty large rocks.</span> <span id="s145">These were not paved roads, they were dirt roads with rock over them.</span> <span id="s146">And I always had bloody knees because I always kept stumbling and falling as the kids would pursue me or they would throw rocks.</span> <span id="s147">They were very handy little missiles, you know, pick them off the floor and start throwing.</span> <span id="s148">So my memories were not particularly happy ones in that town.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: These were kids that were roughly your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: You didn’t have teenagers for example going after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, they didn’t bother with me.</span> <span id="s153">Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s154">I think that some of the older people in town, in the time of higher excitement, particularly after, maybe Hitler made a speech, and we would venture out in the street, in those days they still had horses and wagons, you know.</span> <span id="s155">I remember vividly one particular man who lived close by coming down that street on a wagon and taking his, what do you call this thing that you hit horses with?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: The whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s158">Take the whip and try to catch me walking in the street.</span> <span id="s159">You know, with the whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Crack the whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Cracking ---</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Cracking the whip in your direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No, not in my direction.</span> <span id="s164">He hit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: He got you?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s167">But I think in general that, kind of, was the exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: It must have been lonely not having many kids your age that you could play with?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s170">I really don’t have any strong memories of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: How were you informed that you could no longer go to this public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s173">I think just that one day, I think, my parents told me I was going to Heidelberg to continue school.</span> <span id="s174">And they would buy me a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket, just like the Long Island Railroad.</span> <span id="s175">And every morning, I would end up on that train with a school bag on my back and a big thermos bottle in the school bag with the books, that was my lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Did you know any Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Well I think the village was full of them.</span> <span id="s178">And based on what this fellow wrote in his thesis, more recently, apparently, he tried to interview some of them even as late as last year.</span> <span id="s179">They threatened him with mayhem if he kept up the research.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: There are Nazis still in hold?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Of course we observed many of the, we saw many of the Nazi festivals, and so on, going on.</span> <span id="s182">But, you know, the Nazis were, as usual, disciplined, and they would only take over the action when it was sanctioned like, Kristallnacht, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s183">Otherwise, because, presumably, my father --- not presumably, but my father was a soldier in World War I.</span> <span id="s184">He had somewhat higher stature, if you like, in hierarchy of how they were treating the Jews and some others.</span> <span id="s185">Of course in the final analysis it didn’t do him any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And your father was in the German army in World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yeah, he was in the German army for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: A decorated veteran?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah, he had a cross of this, a cross of that, which I remember he dramatically threw at the Gestapo agent when they eventually deported us.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: In 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: `This may come as a surprise to you but you were a privileged child because your father was a war veteran ---</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Is that really ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: -- Apparently you were able to go to public school longer than the other kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Was that so?</span> <span id="s196">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s197">I see.</span> <span id="s198">A little distinction.</span> <span id="s199">Yeah, they did make a little distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Yes, two or three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes and I remember when the --- after the Kristallnacht, he was arrested and he was sent to Dachau like most of the males, if not all of them.</span> <span id="s202">He was privileged.</span> <span id="s203">He was let out four weeks afterwards and some other people had to wait a little bit longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: So he was able to return home after this first trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yeah, well I think most of them returned home.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Yeah, what was his crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: His crime?</span> <span id="s208">I guess being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Being a Jew, that was it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: He hadn’t done a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Well all the males were arrested, after the Kristallnacht so the reason, I don’t know what they are, logical, or if they needed any.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: You remember Kristallnacht fairly well?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yeah, but before we talk about it, I’d like to tell you one incident which was --- and I don’t remember what year it was.</span> <span id="s215">We lived in this little town called Humfenheim, essentially an agricultural town.</span> <span id="s216">In those days some farmers still lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs.</span> <span id="s217">I mean that’s how close they were.</span> <span id="s218">And, the regional town called Sinsheim is about four kilometers from there.</span> <span id="s219">And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to Sinsheim I don’t remember why, and one of the pleasures along that road was that the road was lined on both sides with apple trees.</span> <span id="s220">It must have been the time when the apples were just about ripened, but they weren’t ripe yet.</span> <span id="s221">And to this day I love green apples.</span> <span id="s222">We ate a lot of green apples as we walked along that national road, a two-lane road.</span> <span id="s223">And we’d take a bite out of the apple and we would throw the rest of the apple at whatever car was speeding by.</span> <span id="s224">We would miss most of them but this particular car, we hit right smack on the door and the whole apple splattered.</span> <span id="s225">The car came to a grinding halt, backed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the SS sign of this particular car which was on the road.</span> <span id="s226">And the SS guy comes out of the car.</span> <span id="s227">“Who threw the apple?’</span> <span id="s228">And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying.</span> <span id="s229">He took our name and didn’t say anything more.</span> <span id="s230">That night we came home and our father says, “I had a call… I was visited by the police.</span> <span id="s231">What did you guys do?</span> <span id="s232">You were throwing apples.”</span> <span id="s233">“We weren’t throwing apples.”</span> <span id="s234">And he hit us across the face, I can still…</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: You lied to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I lied to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: He believed the SS over you?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well, I was so scared.</span> <span id="s239">I remember that very vividly.</span> <span id="s240">So when you say did I encounter any Nazis, well that was a very close encounter.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: That’s a very close encounter.</span> <span id="s242">SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I would guess it was 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: After you had stopped going to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Probably, yeah, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And you didn’t know it was an SS car?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: No, no, we would throw apples at any car.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You hit the jackpot.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did your father have any non-Jewish customers, I would think?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I presume he did, as long as it was all right to buy from a Jewish shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do you recall how his business fared after the Nazis came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, I think it quickly went to pot, but I don’t really remember the details, really, I had very little to do with the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So you wouldn’t know whether there was boycotts?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Shunning and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s258">I think it probably followed the typical German history of this time.</span> <span id="s259">These villages were surprisingly proactive.</span> <span id="s260">And based on what this fellow, recently has told me, it’s still true.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: In general, the Nazis were much more popular and stronger in the small towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Oh is that so, I see, I didn’t realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: The smaller the more likely…</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Big cities tended to be Red.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yeah, well because everybody knew everybody and of course the Jews stuck out like a sore thumb I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Even though there weren’t very many Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No, but at least you knew who they were, and of course… An interesting incident that this guy told me.</span> <span id="s269">There’s a bakery there in this village, today, and would you believe that every Friday they bake and sell challah?</span> <span id="s270">And he told me that they do this because I guess the Christian population loved the challah, even though it was Jewish bread, right.</span> <span id="s271">And today, they have forgotten what the history, he told me, they forgotten the history of why is this bread baked the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: And when.</span> <span id="s273">And when.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s275">This generation at least, has forgotten.</span> <span id="s276">It is amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: And yet they do it on Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Oh yes, yeah, for the weekend, in other words.</span> <span id="s279">That’s amazing I thought…here is archeology in action while I’m still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Do any other incidents leap to your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: From that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Well, one memory is the…all of these villages had communal gardens… and if you didn’t, most people didn’t have a lot of land on their own, they lived in these villages, you could get a little plot from the community, raise your own vegetables and of course, you take that home.</span> <span id="s284">And I remember my mother working in this communal garden, you know.</span> <span id="s285">And we, as kids, would go to the local river which flows right by, which when I look at it now is about three feet wide, at that time it looked terrifying, and take water out and put it in the garden.</span> <span id="s286">I’m still afraid of water because we used to swim in this water, or try to, and the other kids would like to drown us.</span> <span id="s287">And I’m still terrified of the water.</span> <span id="s288">In fact, I’m a very poor swimmer, I think as a result of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: You live on Long Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A?</span> <span id="s291">Yeah.</span> <span id="s292">Incidents, and I am a sailor too.</span> <span id="s293">I…One winter, we, I had some sort like a snow- suit on, very warmly dressed, it was very cold there.</span> <span id="s294">And in the kitchen we had a cooking stove which was fired, I think, by coal or wood, probably coal.</span> <span id="s295">And a big pot of soup was bubbling away.</span> <span id="s296">Someone accidently turned that soup over and it landed on my leg.</span> <span id="s297">I got a tremendous burn over here.</span> <span id="s298">This was the time when Jews couldn’t receive medical attention from non-Jewish doctors and there was no Jewish doctor in this town.</span> <span id="s299">And I almost died because they… Eventually the doctor that delivered me in 1929 who came from another little town, this Sisnheim I was talking about, snuck into the house at night and provided some limited amount of medical attention.</span> <span id="s300">.</span> <span id="s301">I remember that particular incident.</span> <span id="s302">Of course I’m carrying that scar around</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Was he a Jewish doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No, he was not.</span> <span id="s305">He was a Christian doctor.</span> <span id="s306">I don’t remember his name but he was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s307">I remember a time, you probably know the year, when they insisted that all of the Jewish boys and girls get a Jewish identity card.</span> <span id="s308">When is that ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: ’38.</span> <span id="s311">Again we had to go to this (unintelligible ) town and get the card, get the picture.</span> <span id="s312">In fact I have the picture here in my file, and from then on I had a middle name called Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: And if you has a sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: She would have been Sarah.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Do you remember your parents talking about politics or talking about the Nazis in the household?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I don’t have any real recollection.</span> <span id="s317">They must have been so preoccupied and so overwhelmed with the day-to-day problems of making a living and making ends meet that if they did talk about it maybe they talked about it when I wasn’t present but I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Do you remember whether your mother was allowed to tend her garden until the deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: I don’t remember how far that went, or how long this lasted.</span> <span id="s320">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And Kristallnacht you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah, vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Vividly?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Can you describe what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah, what I saw.</span> <span id="s327">I went to the train that morning, and went to school in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s328">This didn’t happen in the night of the 9th to 10th in this village.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: They were behind a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yeah, I guess they didn’t get the message or something.</span> <span id="s331">Even though, you know, this was a particular (unintelligible) what was his name?</span> <span id="s332">Wagner, I think, who apparently was more rabid than most.</span> <span id="s333">And apparently he was a major factor behind this.</span> <span id="s334">And the first thing I knew is when I got to Heidelberg and got to school, in the school, they told a lot of kids to go back home because something was happening.</span> <span id="s335">Or maybe they told us what was happening.</span> <span id="s336">I don’t remember the specific event.</span> <span id="s337">I went back to the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: This was at the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s340">The Jewish school.</span> <span id="s341">I went back to the railroad station and caught the first train I possibly could.</span> <span id="s342">This was not exactly on the half-hour.</span> <span id="s343">And as I was walking out from the railroad station and looking up the so called main street, right by the little post office I suddenly saw my parents pushing a very large pushcart with whatever, in retrospect, they could save from this apartment which was right adjoining the synagogue I was telling you about.</span> <span id="s344">And pushing it, you know, to my uncle’s house where they had made room for us to live with them.</span> <span id="s345">They did not, as I remember, they didn’t burn that synagogue.</span> <span id="s346">They literally took axes and hammers and kind of destroyed it bit by bit without setting it on fire.</span> <span id="s347">When I was in Germany about a year and a half ago, for the second time, the local minister walked me around the village.</span> <span id="s348">This is a whole separate subject.</span> <span id="s349">And he took me to the place where the synagogue was, which I had a little trouble remembering and, well, there it was.</span> <span id="s350">They had managed to put a little plaque up which said “former synagogue”.</span> <span id="s351">They had, of course appropriated eventually the real estate, and a pharmacy had been built on that lot.</span> <span id="s352">So there’s no evidence.</span> <span id="s353">That’s really all I remember except my father being arrested, sent to Dachau and came back, I believe about four weeks later.</span> <span id="s354">It was snowing.</span> <span id="s355">This was November so this would make sense.</span> <span id="s356">December, January or something like that.</span> <span id="s357">He was limping very badly, had a red bandage, a red kerchief-like tied around foot, you know, ambling into the house.</span> <span id="s358">I remember that particular scene.</span> <span id="s359">That’s about all I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Kristallnacht, you never returned to the apartment?</span> <span id="s361">Your parents had basically left?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s363">It was all destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: The apartment was gutted?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yeah, all the furniture was destroyed and whatever belongings we might have had were destroyed except what they could manage to get on that cart.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: The pushcart was there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And your younger brother was with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: I believe so, yeah.</span> <span id="s370">He was too young to go to school at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Do you remember anything else on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Not really, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Just walking into your uncle’s apartment.</span> <span id="s374">(?)</span> <span id="s375">wasn’t there either.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Well, no, he was also at Dachau, so here you had all the women and children living in this one place.</span> <span id="s377">That’s the place where I got burned so it must have been ’38, ’39 it must have been.</span> <span id="s378">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Do you remember anything your father said when he came back from Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I really don’t.</span> <span id="s381">I think it was … I think I remember tears but I don’t remember words.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: How was life the next few years?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: It’s a blank.</span> <span id="s384">I don’t remember what life was like the nest two years, except that my father’s brother, with his wife and daughter, the (?)</span> <span id="s385">that was mentioned earlier.</span> <span id="s386">We lived in South Birken which is more or less on the border with France.</span> <span id="s387">I guess they were forced to evacuate because Jews couldn’t live too close to the border, I suppose, and they also moved in with us, with that uncle.</span> <span id="s388">So now a family of two suddenly became five and now suddenly became eight.</span> <span id="s389">And of course, the house got a little tight with eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Were these uncles all brothers of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No.</span> <span id="s392">Yeah.</span> <span id="s393">The uncle we moved in with was the uncle of my father, not my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s395">It was your father’s uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s397">I think the two brothers were brothers of his.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Grand (?)</span> <span id="s399">And then the one from Starboken?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yes, he was the true uncle to me.</span> <span id="s401">He was my father’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: It was crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yeah, it was crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Did you continue going to school in Heidelberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No, I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s406">I’m not sure, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: So you don’t know whether that school or whether…</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: No I don’t know what happened to that school.</span> <span id="s409">I remember the teachers names(?)</span> <span id="s410">.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Reunion two years later?</span> <span id="s412">Do you remember any changes when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s413">In ’39 or ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Not really except that you know that the war was so favorable to the Germans so quickly they were all elated and I think the happier they were the more anti-Jewish they became.</span> <span id="s415">I mean it just were a way of beating up on somebody.</span> <span id="s416">I remember vividly, I must have gone to school because I was in Heidelberg, and they had a big exhibition under a tent in the middle of the town square of some of the war booty that they had captured in Poland and France.</span> <span id="s417">I think it was French equipment, maybe also British equipment from Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s418">.</span> <span id="s419">And of course, theoretically, only Germans were allowed there.</span> <span id="s420">At that time we couldn’t go to the movie… I’ve never seen a movie in Germany, no we couldn’t go to the movies…</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Not allowed…</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: And, I always passed myself off as a German, you know, or a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s423">And, I would Heil Hitler up and down that tent, you know, and look at all that equipment, you know.</span> <span id="s424">All the kids, all the boys are interested in guns and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: And they didn’t know you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Of course they didn’t.</span> <span id="s427">I had no trouble passing.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Were you proud as a German regarding these victories?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s430">I don’t think I thought of myself as anything other than.</span> <span id="s431">But I really didn’t have any of these philosophical opinions at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: But you know, sometimes kids, especially boys, are impressed by military trophies, military weaponry…</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Well, I remember Heil Hitlering, you know, just to get by, because it seemed like the thing to do (?)</span> <span id="s434">I had blond hair in those days, I still have blue eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: You still have blue eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I didn’t have a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: You were an Aryan.</span> <span id="s438">That brings us now to October 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: How did you find out about this new voyage, this new trip of yours to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Well, as I can remember it, the police came to the door and they told us we had two hours to pack some minimum amount they allowed us to carry, I forgot how many kilograms it may have been.</span> <span id="s442">And we went.</span> <span id="s443">One of them stayed with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: One of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: One of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Police or storm troopers?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s448">I thought he had a black uniform on but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s449">I know he had a gun.</span> <span id="s450">Guns were still somewhat unique.</span> <span id="s451">And he kind of rested his hand on the gun, I think it was just a way of kind of resting his hand, I don’t think he meant anything.</span> <span id="s452">And frankly, I don’t know what the reaction of my parents was.</span> <span id="s453">Except that there was a lot of scurrying around and grabbing suitcases and so on and so forth and stuffing in rather irrelevant things I’m sure.</span> <span id="s454">In fact, I know it was irrelevant because later on I found some of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Did you help pack?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did you help pack?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: I don’t think so, no, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s459">And that’s one incident I remember when my father had some words with the policeman.</span> <span id="s460">He might have known him.</span> <span id="s461">I don’t know whether he was a local guy or not.</span> <span id="s462">And, kind of threw him or handed him his Iron Cross from World War I.</span> <span id="s463">The next thing I remember is we walked through the streets, I believe, down to City Hall, where the bus, some sort of bus or perhaps truck was waiting and they put us all in this truck, with whatever bags we had.</span> <span id="s464">The local Germans were, of course, were looking around their curtains, of course, and their doorways and what not.</span> <span id="s465">I don’t remember anybody saying anything.</span> <span id="s466">And they trucked us to Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s467">To the railroad station.</span> <span id="s468">Where we boarded a waiting train.</span> <span id="s469">This was not a cattle car train, this was a passenger coacher, and there we sat, probably waiting for a number of other people coming in, and eventually the train started to move.</span> <span id="s470">I remember an incident where the accompanying Germans, I presumed they were Gestapo but I really don’t know, asked for all valuables.</span> <span id="s471">And I presume, as good Germans, we probably handed them over, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s472">That’s about all I can remember from the trip except eventually we stopped at the German border, and I’m almost 100% sure it stopped in Mullhurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Mullhurst?</span> <span id="s474">Did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yeah, yeah because I remember, I think I saw that name on the station.</span> <span id="s476">And it stopped and went and it took a rather long time and eventually it ended up in some siding.</span> <span id="s477">We had no idea where we were because nobody told us where we were going.</span> <span id="s478">And they took us off the train and I’m quite sure it was raining and we ended up on dump trucks, I know these were dump trucks.</span> <span id="s479">There was a lot of mud, and they trucked us, I guess, from (?)</span> <span id="s480">railroad station (?)</span> <span id="s481">into what turned out to be Gurst (?)</span> <span id="s482">.</span> <span id="s483">I had no idea where they were taking us.</span> <span id="s484">I mean I had no idea what was going on.</span> <span id="s485">We just…it’s almost like being asleep walk at this point.</span> <span id="s486">I don’t know what the adults were thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Even though you were going to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Before you…</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No.</span> <span id="s491">I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Nobody…</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: I had no idea and I’m not sure they told this to anybody till eventually they ended up in France and of course they probably could see and read the signs at that time.</span> <span id="s494">We knew nothing about this Madagascar business and so on that eventually developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You all sat together on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Family?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s499">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: As far as you could tell of the Jews, all of Jews that you knew from your town were on this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well, I presume so.</span> <span id="s502">Yeah.</span> <span id="s503">I knew all the Jews were deported at the same time…</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s505">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: …and I presume we were more or less in the same carriage.</span> <span id="s507">I imagine they loaded those as people came along, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: What did you take?</span> <span id="s509">What did your parents take?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s511">But, I know that after my parents were re-deported from Gurst to Auschwitz eventually, my mother left behind one of those suitcases which somehow reached me where I was and it had a lot of bed linen in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: No beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No beds.</span> <span id="s514">No.</span> <span id="s515">But bed- linens.</span> <span id="s516">At long last.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: How were you treated at Gurst?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Well as you know Gurst was divided and men and women were separated.</span> <span id="s519">Both of us ended with the mother.</span> <span id="s520">We were in (?)</span> <span id="s521">if I remember right.</span> <span id="s522">You know being curious boys, this was all new.</span> <span id="s523">There was naturally a fence around it.</span> <span id="s524">There were barracks, completely bare.</span> <span id="s525">I don’t believe we had mattresses.</span> <span id="s526">I don’t remember that when we moved in there.</span> <span id="s527">And all the people were just kind of laying like stacked wood, one next to the other.</span> <span id="s528">I saw my first death there one morning.</span> <span id="s529">Someone who was laying near me, perhaps not next to me, passed away during the night and my mother rushed me out of the room, the barracks, as quickly as she could.</span> <span id="s530">This was October/November, and as you know was rather miserable weather.</span> <span id="s531">Very muddy, very rainy, rather cold.</span> <span id="s532">I don’t remember the barracks being heated, but they might have been.</span> <span id="s533">It was a rather, you know, difficult situation.</span> <span id="s534">The toilets were communal and washing area was communal where everyone washed in a long trough with, I believe it was a pipe that had a bunch of holes punched in it and someone turned the faucet on and the water came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Cold water only?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">I believe so, yeah.</span> <span id="s538">I don’t believe there were showers.</span> <span id="s539">I can’t remember any showers.</span> <span id="s540">But then as a boy I wasn’t too anxious to shower anyway.</span> <span id="s541">I remember the toilets.</span> <span id="s542">They were surprisingly mechanical.</span> <span id="s543">You climbed up a bunch of stairs and there was a platform.</span> <span id="s544">And they had the fifty gallon barrels under the big hole and you did your thing and then it plopped into the barrel.</span> <span id="s545">And the…the small narrow range railroad, railway, rail line, circled the camp and they would move these barrels on top of some sort of flatbed car like affair, and they would push it to wherever they would dump it.</span> <span id="s546">That’s how they moved it.</span> <span id="s547">I don’t remember why I would know that detail.</span> <span id="s548">As kids, we would… the camp of course was not guarded by Germans.</span> <span id="s549">This was Vichy France, guarded by French soldiers who were relatively loose.</span> <span id="s550">I don’t know how, but, we as kids, managed to crawl under the fence and go to visit our father in the separate part of this camp.</span> <span id="s551">My father lucked out because he was a butcher, they thought he would make a cook.</span> <span id="s552">And he ended up working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s553">And he would sneak us an extra piece of bread or whatever he could lay his hands on.</span> <span id="s554">I have some vague memory of going… Some of the older boys would sneak into the local town, which was about…</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So you could get out of the outer fence too?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s557">And I remember buying some pate, in a tin can.</span> <span id="s558">I don’t know where we got the money, and going back to camp at night.</span> <span id="s559">I remember one guard, oh yeah … we had a very good looking redhead in this barracks and…</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: That’s right, you were in the women’s …</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yeah, I instantly fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s562">I don’t know how old she was, she must have eighteen, twenty.</span> <span id="s563">With long reddish hair.</span> <span id="s564">I’ve had a red hair fetish ever since.</span> <span id="s565">And, I remember watching her making love with that French soldier, that French guard.</span> <span id="s566">She wore a cross and obviously she was half, so-called, half Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: She never reciprocated interest in you, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: No.</span> <span id="s569">I was too young.</span> <span id="s570">I saw my father’s?</span> <span id="s571">brother there a few times.</span> <span id="s572">I saw the other uncle, my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s573">I don’t remember seeing my grandmother, who died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: You didn’t attend her funeral?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: But she died after I left.</span> <span id="s576">The mud is the most memorable thing I think.</span> <span id="s577">It’s an incredible mark, it’s very deep.</span> <span id="s578">We, somehow, we, many of us ended up with galoshes, which is, you know, sort of a rubber shoe.</span> <span id="s579">If you stepped in that mud and then tried to pull it out, the suction of that mud was such that you could lose your shoe.</span> <span id="s580">And I remember many older people, falling in that mud and having a hell of a time getting back out of it.</span> <span id="s581">And if you went to help them, they would pull you in the mud.</span> <span id="s582">And so for many months (?)</span> <span id="s583">struggled with that mud.</span> <span id="s584">I don’t know why that sticks in my head, but it seems to have been a major problem…</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: That seems to be a major memory of all the people who were at Gurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I remember getting some terribly strong vaccinations and believe it or not I have a certificate from (?)</span> <span id="s587">signed by the doctor at (?)</span> <span id="s588">against typhoid, diphtheria, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s589">Apparently these things developed in those great environments very quickly and they inoculated, I guess, all the kids.</span> <span id="s590">And I presume many of the deaths which occurred there, probably occurred due to some of these epidemics that developed that you might know more about us than I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: When you weren’t eating pate, what were you eating in this camp, what did they feed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: The standard fare seemed to be just some sort of a soup with some vegetables floating in it, that’s all I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Not especially tasty?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Not particularly.</span> <span id="s595">The French eat a lot of beets, at least we ended up with a lot of beets, and (?)</span> <span id="s596">we called them.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: How about quantity?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Oh I think we were always hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: You were always hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s601">I don’t remember any particular packages coming in from the Salvation Army or the Red Cross and so on.</span> <span id="s602">I know these people in later years, I found out they were quite active, but I wasn’t particularly aware of that activity.</span> <span id="s603">It doesn’t mean that it didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s604">As I said we managed to get some extra pieces of bread from my father.</span> <span id="s605">He would hold it at the end of a long fork against this open fire where they had these big, tremendous, fifty- gallon drums bubbling away with the coup of the day and he would toast it.</span> <span id="s606">And they had these, maybe five gallon drums of fat standing there, and he would spread that on the toasted bread and that would taste like heaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Not a kosher kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: No, I don’t think there was any attempt at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Was there any cooking outside of this central kitchen where your father worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Not that I’m aware of, not that I’m aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Now, earlier, you mentioned that you saw your teacher from Heidelberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Was there any attempt to resume schooling, have classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I don’t believe so, not while I was there, no.</span> <span id="s615">I have no recollection of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Now the time you were there.</span> <span id="s617">What did you do during the day when you weren’t sneaking out under the fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s619">I don’t know how we spent the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Not much to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: I guess, you know, kids at that age, as long as they are in reasonably good health, I guess we ran around, we probably became very rowdy and non-controllable, I suppose.</span> <span id="s622">I really don’t know what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: I’m sure you tried to stay warm, this was winter.</span> <span id="s624">You had gotten there just in the nick of time as far as winter is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I imagine I blocked out quite a bit of these negative part, I only seem to remember the better parts, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Did anyone have any idea what was to become of you?</span> <span id="s627">Where you would go or how long you would stay or why you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s629">I don’t what the adults knew.</span> <span id="s630">I had no idea what they talked about.</span> <span id="s631">I don’t know if they, men and women, ever got together even for talking purposes.</span> <span id="s632">All I know is that one day my mother and father both said that they had volunteered us to be taken out of the camp by some organization and I don’t remember my reaction.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t know whether I was delighted or reluctant.</span> <span id="s634">But we found ourselves, I guess, again on the truck with forty-seven some other children, fifty children were taken out and we eventually ended up in a French orphanage, near that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s637">This was in 1941, February ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: February ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: So I was in that camp about three to four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: You were taken to an orphanage nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yes, so my brother and I, with the other kids, were taken to the orphanage and it turned out later on that a branch of the American Quakers, the American Friends Service Committee, acting through the Swedish chapter, had made arrangements with the French government to take these fifty children out.</span> <span id="s642">The French in World War 1, you know, had lost many men, so there were millions, I guess literally millions, of households without males.</span> <span id="s643">So they built a whole number of orphanages … (side one of tape ended, pick up with side two)</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: We were talking about the orphanage …</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s646">And this was now roughly twenty years later.</span> <span id="s647">The orphans of course had grown up, the orphanages were relatively empty and, I guess, somebody was smart enough to realize that here was a possible place where, at least you could put some people.</span> <span id="s648">As I understand it, the Quakers committed themselves to feed the whole orphanage if they took these fifty Jewish children … So we ended up in this orphanage in a little place called Aspet, A-S-P-E-T, in the Haute Garron (?)</span> <span id="s649">department.</span> <span id="s650">Near …</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Towards the Atlantic?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s653">This was right at the foot of the Pyrenees.</span> <span id="s654">It was not too far from (?)</span> <span id="s655">.</span> <span id="s656">It was near a larger town called Saint Grodance (???)</span> <span id="s657">.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: But it’s toward the western part, that would be rather than towards the Mediterranean.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s660">But it is quite close by.</span> <span id="s661">We ended up in this orphanage.</span> <span id="s662">I believe it was a two or three story affair, there was a sort of a classical institutional looking affair.</span> <span id="s663">These German kids, of course now we were Germans, we weren’t Jewish, in this French institution.</span> <span id="s664">The French had just lost the war so they didn’t have a lot of love for the Germans, right.</span> <span id="s665">So we were the (?)</span> <span id="s666">no matter how you looked at it.</span> <span id="s667">The director of the camp was an interesting man …</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: The director of the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Of the orphanage, and he had some women who helped him.</span> <span id="s670">They organized us like little soldiers and that’s how … there were roughly half and half boys and half girls in this little group of Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Kept separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: We were kept separate.</span> <span id="s673">As I remember we did not go to German schools, French schools rather.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: The nationality of the director …</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: He was French.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: He was French.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: And these Quakers …</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: The Quakers just came and went.</span> <span id="s680">I mean they came perhaps once every few months and see how we were doing and then left.</span> <span id="s681">I guess they provided food in part for the whole institution.</span> <span id="s682">There were of course other French children there.</span> <span id="s683">It was a fairly self-contained community relatively speaking.</span> <span id="s684">They had their own fields where they raised vegetables.</span> <span id="s685">I remember they had a man on the horse who did the plowing.</span> <span id="s686">They had an infirmary there.</span> <span id="s687">And I guess they tried to bring us up as sort of little bit like French kids would be.</span> <span id="s688">They walked us around the hall somewhat on a military side, but I guess that’s the only way you could control fifty kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: They didn’t give you wine though?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: So you weren’t 100 % French.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: No.</span> <span id="s693">I don’t think we had wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: The nationality of these Quakers, was it Swedish or American?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Swedish.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Swedish.</span> <span id="s697">And aside from the schools was there anything else that you had to do?</span> <span id="s698">You didn’t work in the gardens or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I think we did some chores and at sometime they brought in a Jewish couple who lived in the village and I think he would come in and give us some modicum of instruction.</span> <span id="s700">I doubt it was particularly effective but they made an attempt when he was till busy hiding of course.</span> <span id="s701">This was Vichy France at the time.</span> <span id="s702">The only memories I have is this farmer who took care of the fields where they grew the vegetables, one day they decided, somebody decided, they were going to kill the cows so they could feed the kids.</span> <span id="s703">And it’s an indescribable scene on how this cow was killed.</span> <span id="s704">I don’t know if you want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s705">For the hell of it I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s706">There was a manhole cover right in front of the so-called cafeteria, or the Refectoire, as the French called it, and they tied the cow down on this manhole which was of course steel and relatively heavy, by the horns, so the cow was now sort of …</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Nose to the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: …Nose to the ground.</span> <span id="s709">And this guy, was a big guy, would take a pickaxe and would literally hit this cow between the horns.</span> <span id="s710">It seems like hundreds of times till eventually, I don’t know how long it was, but it was too long, eventually the cow got on his knees and just died.</span> <span id="s711">The French eat blood sausages, are you familiar with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Or blood, it’s not even sausage.</span> <span id="s714">They take the live blood and bake it, I forgot what it’s called.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: They put it in soup basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Not soup, no.</span> <span id="s717">It becomes almost like a jello.</span> <span id="s718">It becomes, yeah.</span> <span id="s719">And that’s the first thing I remember them feeding us.</span> <span id="s720">And well, that’s one thing I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: You scooped all of this up of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: I mean did you really feel like eating this?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No.</span> <span id="s725">I have had an aversion to blood ever since.</span> <span id="s726">But to the French this was fairly routine.</span> <span id="s727">If they killed a sheep, which was fairly routine, the blood would be collected and that was one of things …</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: And meat was a luxury.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s730">Well that was rare.</span> <span id="s731">Every afternoon it seemed like they would insist we would walk in fairly ordered fashion through the village and through the surrounding countryside, which in retrospect was quite beautiful.</span> <span id="s732">And they would teach us French songs and we would march to these songs and that’s how we got our fresh air.</span> <span id="s733">I remember when we first got there, I guess we had a lot of lice and all the boys got their hair cut down to the scalp, including myself.</span> <span id="s734">I have a pict.</span> <span id="s735">.</span> <span id="s736">they took a set of I.D. pictures of every kid.</span> <span id="s737">I still have one of them from that time.</span> <span id="s738">There was a lot of bed wetting, I remember and I think I was one of them.</span> <span id="s739">And they shamed us …</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Unintentional.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s742">Well I think all of the kids were obviously disturbed.</span> <span id="s743">And that went on a long time.</span> <span id="s744">I remember, I don’t know why, I remember the toilets, the typical French, just a hole in the ground, with an appliance over the hole and you put your feet on either side and you crouch down and do your thing.</span> <span id="s745">Paper was very rare and many of boys would wipe their behind by just cleaning their finger on the wall.</span> <span id="s746">And one of the jobs that we had was to clean the walls.</span> <span id="s747">Well we tried to instill in the kids to stop doing that but one kid would continue to do it and we couldn’t find out who it was.</span> <span id="s748">So we decided to stake out the toilets.</span> <span id="s749">The toilets had fairly high walls but they were open on top and on the bottom.</span> <span id="s750">So we put two kids on top of the wall watching, and this one kid would come into the toilet and he did his thing and wipe his finger on the wall and of course we beat the hell out of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: And made him clean it …</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: And you know what his nickname was for the rest of the time we were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: No.</span> <span id="s755">The name for (?)</span> <span id="s756">is (?)</span> <span id="s757">in French.</span> <span id="s758">His nickname was (?)</span> <span id="s759">.</span> <span id="s760">You know when you wipe your thing?</span> <span id="s761">His name was (?)</span> <span id="s762">.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: You didn’t make him clean it?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Well what’s amusing is that in 1972, I believe it was, my wife and I went back and retraced all these steps I was just talking about.</span> <span id="s765">And we went to this little village of Aspet and the orphanage is still there and it’s now a home, they told us, for disturbed children.</span> <span id="s766">Of broken marriages, you know divorces are also rampant in France.</span> <span id="s767">And I wanted to go see the toilets.</span> <span id="s768">And would you believe they are still there and they’re still the way they were and the doors are still as high as they were, it’s amazing nothing has changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: And the walls need cleaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, that I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Was your wife, you mentioned you went back with your wife, was your wife there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No, she was born in Vienna, Austria and she came here in 1938, a day or two after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s773">And she lived in the States and I met her here in the 50’s.</span> <span id="s774">What else do I remember of Aspet?</span> <span id="s775">Not very much except we were there until 1942 and we had, the kids who had come out of Gurst had not seen their parents for almost two years.</span> <span id="s776">We were busy trying to, we were saving bread from our ration in shoeboxes because we were all excited that we were going to have a temporary visit with our parents, who at that time had been transferred to (?)</span> <span id="s777">.</span> <span id="s778">I don’t know if all of them had but mine had.</span> <span id="s779">We of course would get correspondence from the parents, regular letters, my brother has most of these letters.</span> <span id="s780">And one day a car came, we were going to go there in August as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So you were going to go to the (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: …of ’42, right.</span> <span id="s783">A car came, a Gestapo car came.</span> <span id="s784">We never saw a German in that place.</span> <span id="s785">The Gestapo showed up.</span> <span id="s786">They went to see the director.</span> <span id="s787">The director called two kids in and said your parents are going to be transferred and they asked that you go with them.</span> <span id="s788">Pack your things and go with these people.</span> <span id="s789">And they left.</span> <span id="s790">And I still remember the name of these kids.</span> <span id="s791">He was one of my friends.</span> <span id="s792">And I had imagined that the worst had happened to him.</span> <span id="s793">I told you downstairs that my brother is writing a history of all of these kids.</span> <span id="s794">Well he met this guy, he told me last year.</span> <span id="s795">He ended up after the war in East Germany and had a whole history of his own on what’s happened in East Germany to him.</span> <span id="s796">So he never ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s797">That’s what I had imagined.</span> <span id="s798">I don’t know how he eventually escaped.</span> <span id="s799">At any rate, to make a long story short, they prevented us from going to (?)</span> <span id="s800">because, unbeknownst to us, that’s when the deportation started.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: …re-deportation started.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s804">The first deportation was to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: And we stayed there for, up to the time, I believe, when the Germans occupied all of France.</span> <span id="s806">Was that in ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: November of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: ’42.</span> <span id="s809">So it was only a month or two later, right, August, September…</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Yeah, a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: And I guess at that time they passed some sort of law that Jews couldn’t live within 20 miles of the Spanish border or something like that, and we were closer than that to the Spanish border and some magic hand, I don’t know who, the Quaker, the Ouzay (?)</span> <span id="s812">, or whatever it was, took us out of this camp and sent up temporarily to Toulouse, where we were in some sort of a school.</span> <span id="s813">And within a month or two I ended up in another town called Montsac (?)</span> <span id="s814">which is in a town (?)</span> <span id="s815">department.</span> <span id="s816">And there was a children’s home there which was run by a Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Ousay?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: It could have been Ousay (?)</span> <span id="s819">and it was on the principle of the boy scouts) That is the life of this organization was, it sort of as you lived there a boy scout 24 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Jewish boy scouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Jewish boy scouts.</span> <span id="s822">French Jewish boy scouts.</span> <span id="s823">Which is fairly prominent organization.</span> <span id="s824">In Toulouse as I remember it, somehow my brother got separated from me.</span> <span id="s825">I don’t know if it was on purpose or otherwise and he ended up in Switzerland and spent the rest of the time, his time, in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: But you didn’t know that until after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: I knew we were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s829">No, but you didn’t know that he had made it to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: I don’t know whether I knew that or not.</span> <span id="s831">I went to see him after the war in Switzerland so somehow I knew or found out where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So the group of 48 transferred out of the orphanage …</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yeah, but then we were …</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: And then you were broken up.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: …broken up.</span> <span id="s836">Yeah.</span> <span id="s837">Different people ended up in different places.</span> <span id="s838">So that takes us to 1943 or so.</span> <span id="s839">Life in Montsac was quite different.</span> <span id="s840">This now was an openly Jewish life.</span> <span id="s841">I wouldn’t say religious but observing.</span> <span id="s842">We all joined boy scout troops, we made our bed, we did kitchen duty.</span> <span id="s843">They had some sort of a schooling organized and had organized a number of trade schools there where you could learn to become a carpenter, a cabinetmaker, an iron worker, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s844">Not terribly practical trades today but in those days that was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s845">Not unlike the kind of preparation, I think, for people who might want to emigrate to then Palestine.</span> <span id="s846">You know, they’d teach you a trade.</span> <span id="s847">That lasted for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: These are all boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: No.</span> <span id="s850">Boys and girls.</span> <span id="s851">It was strictly co-ed.</span> <span id="s852">The girls were on one floor, the boys on the other.</span> <span id="s853">And we were getting through the puberty stage and in fact there were some that were eighteen, perhaps twenty.</span> <span id="s854">And you know, any number of girls got pregnant.</span> <span id="s855">It was not unusual.</span> <span id="s856">But it was fairly, you know, it was a decent life.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Were here boys and girls from other parts of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s859">They were French Jews and there were people from Belgium.</span> <span id="s860">These were families that might have moved to … children who ended up from other countries in France before the war, didn’t have, necessarily French passports, you know, so all kinds of mixture.</span> <span id="s861">There were not that many German Jewish children there.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: They would probably come from (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s864">Btu they mostly, only, talked French there.</span> <span id="s865">By that time you either …</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: You knew French by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Well, yes, more or less.</span> <span id="s868">I’m sure with a very heavy accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: And ironically all of this was under direct German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s871">By that time it was.</span> <span id="s872">This home started before the occupation of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: You got there and it was early in ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s875">Yes.</span> <span id="s876">I’m quite sure that I ended up in early ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Winter.</span> <span id="s878">It seems like you’re making all your moves in winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: We were there for perhaps a year, maybe more than a year when it was obvious that the Germans now had cleaned all the concentration camps of the Jews they already had captive and they were starting to arrest other Jews including the French Jews.</span> <span id="s880">And whoever this magic hands was, decided we better move all these kids so called underground, so to speak underground.</span> <span id="s881">And we all received French identity cards, phony identity cards.</span> <span id="s882">My name became Marcel Mantue (?)</span> <span id="s883">And I ended up hidden in a county seat called (?)</span> <span id="s884">where French children would go to school during the school year from the farms, they would stay in the school like here in the, you would have dorms in a college and you would stay …</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Boarding school …</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s887">Like boarding school.</span> <span id="s888">But public … Ad then during the vacation of course they would go home.</span> <span id="s889">And I bluffed myself through that school, hiding my identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: So you had to hide your identity from the other students?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: No one had to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s894">That’s right.</span> <span id="s895">I don’t remember how successful I was.</span> <span id="s896">And during the summer, the same invisible hand had managed to make arrangements with a number of farms in the area to take a number of children who had no other place to go.</span> <span id="s897">Whether these people knew we were Jewish or not, I have no idea and I spent either one or two summers during the summer vacation that way on the farm.</span> <span id="s898">Guarding sheep.</span> <span id="s899">Very useful, typical French farmhouse.</span> <span id="s900">Probably ate very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Is this still the same part of France, in the south?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yes, it’s south.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Southwest?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: All southern France.</span> <span id="s905">While we were in Montsac, of course, in the boy scouts we would camp during the summer.</span> <span id="s906">We would, in fact we camped somewhere near (?)</span> <span id="s907">in that French, in that partisan village we were talking about earlier.</span> <span id="s908">We would celebrate the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s909">We had a chorale , a singing chorale, which was presumably quite good, led by a young guy who became quite famous and lived in Geneva, Switzerland, perhaps (?)</span> <span id="s910">and a chorale director.</span> <span id="s911">It was in retrospect, an interesting life.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s913">I see smiles on your face.</span> <span id="s914">It wasn’t all bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s916">There were some tense moments while we were underground, you know, as I guess we moved into 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Is this when you were on a shepherd, or a farmer, or already before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Well, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s919">There was one summer when we ended up in some other arrangement and the Germans, I guess, had found out that there might be either some Jews hiding or some (?)</span> <span id="s920">fighters hiding and they raided this place and we had to disappear into the woods rather hurriedly.</span> <span id="s921">We heard machine guns of course and a number of people were arrested but somehow I managed to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Did you know anyone who was arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s924">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Jews, Jewish refugees or rescuers?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s927">I guess there was more concerned for fellows who were eighteen, twenty, twenty-five years old.</span> <span id="s928">I was still fourteen, fifteen at the time.</span> <span id="s929">On the assumption you could hide your identity.</span> <span id="s930">You know, if you didn’t register for labor in Germany and so on you were subject to arrest even if you were French.</span> <span id="s931">Well that’s how we somehow got through the war.</span> <span id="s932">We somehow heard about D-Day.</span> <span id="s933">And eventually we all ended up back in Montsac in this home.</span> <span id="s934">The home now took over a building, a relatively new building that the Vichy government had built for physical education because they were going to develop their own master race.</span> <span id="s935">So we ended up in this rather posh building which today, incidentally is a hotel which I slept in when I was back there in 1972.</span> <span id="s936">It was a time-warp experience of it’s own.</span> <span id="s937">And …</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Do you know when you were liberated?</span> <span id="s939">Or where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: I don’t remember exactly where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Summer of ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s943">Must have been in the summer of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Did you ever see combat troops, either German or American?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: The only real memory I have is seeing a big pipeline with a lot of gasoline leaking out of it and I’ve never seen red gasoline before, it was all red, on some of the major roads we were hiking on.</span> <span id="s946">I think, of course, that happened while we were in the boy-scout camp since they landed in June.</span> <span id="s947">This all happened during the summer so I presume we were not in school at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: The landing in Normandy was in June.</span> <span id="s949">The landing in the Mediterranean was in August.</span> <span id="s950">You were kind of in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s952">So I’m sure I saw the pipeline that came out from probably Marseilles or (?)</span> <span id="s953">.</span> <span id="s954">There wasn’t any significant fighting as I remember it in that area.</span> <span id="s955">I think most of the fighting was up north of course and it didn’t take too long for the Germans to all hustle themselves north and east trying to…</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Avoid the trap…</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: …to defend the Normandy part of the invasion.</span> <span id="s958">But I don’t think there was any fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: In your area they were in risk, they were in danger of being cut off from the Mediterranean operation up the Rhone valley linking up with the operation north which would have cut off all the forces to the southwest.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I see.</span> <span id="s961">I see.</span> <span id="s962">So what we saw more of was the (?)</span> <span id="s963">taking revenge on the local French, particularly, I remember rather vividly the women who had so-called fraternized with the French, getting their hair shorn, that was more prominent.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Those were the quite fortunate ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: So we ended back in Montsac and tried to return to normal.</span> <span id="s966">The school started again etc. etc.</span> <span id="s967">Somehow I believe this was a Quaker (?)</span> <span id="s968">somehow got in touch with me.</span> <span id="s969">They wanted to know if I knew anyone in the United States and whether I wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s970">So I said, “Well, yes I remember my parents telling me about an uncle in the United States.”</span> <span id="s971">In retrospect, it wasn’t an uncle, it was a second cousin of my grandmother’s.</span> <span id="s972">It was a man who had come over in something like 1908.</span> <span id="s973">In fact, he was a brother of the man we moved in with after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s974">(?)</span> <span id="s975">and they placed an ad in the paper, in the New York area, and he had over his many years, sponsored maybe something like 20 or 30 couples to come here (?)</span> <span id="s976">And he told me in retrospect he got a lot of calls.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: So you didn’t have to be a cousin, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: On this ad.</span> <span id="s979">Well, at this time they were curious on who survived.</span> <span id="s980">None of his families.</span> <span id="s981">And he asked me whether I come over.</span> <span id="s982">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s983">I remember receiving a very large package with, I believe a salami that looked like it was three feet long but maybe it was only one foot.</span> <span id="s984">And I remember standing at the children’s home, in my room which I shared with a number of other boys, and slicing salami for two or three hours because everybody’s coming by getting a piece of salami.</span> <span id="s985">After about a year, well, in fact it was December ’46, I eventually came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: To the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: And I came over early, believe it or not, because I was not on a Jewish quota.</span> <span id="s988">I was now on a German quota.</span> <span id="s989">And the German quota was undersubscribed because during the war, obviously did not come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: It was unused?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yeah, and since I had so called … in the eyes of the Americans I was a German, so I could get in under the German quota.</span> <span id="s992">Irony, isn’t it.</span> <span id="s993">So I ended up in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s994">I came over on the Normandy (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No, I stayed here five years and I had a dying to go to California and I did.</span> <span id="s997">I ended up in California for 15-16 years and came back here in 1970.</span> <span id="s998">And here we are in 1992.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Your brother who escaped to Switzerland, he went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A Yes, I went to visit him after I had agreed to come here to talk him into coming with me.</span> <span id="s1001">He had come under the influence of very religious Zionist organizations, I don’t remember who it was.</span> <span id="s1002">He was only about 11 or 12 and he was going to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1003">He insisted.</span> <span id="s1004">And I said, okay, if that’s what you want to do.</span> <span id="s1005">So he ended up in Palestine before the state became Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: You were never tempted to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: I might have been but, I guess, not enough to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Were your parents especially happy with (?)</span> <span id="s1009">.</span> <span id="s1010">Did they ever talk about or think about leaving there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yes, they wanted to come here.</span> <span id="s1012">And as a matter of fact they had a quota.</span> <span id="s1013">Believe it or not I remember the number.</span> <span id="s1014">Not exactly, but it was something like 16,000 something, and they were waiting for an affidavit from this same uncle.</span> <span id="s1015">And perhaps had the affidavit, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1016">But obviously you couldn’t go until your number was up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And the deportation of course.</span></p></body></html>
