St. Paul Jewish Community Center, on June 2, 1983.</span> <span id="s5">Mrs. Weingarten, please tell me your complete name, including your Jewish name, if it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: My name is Felicia.</span> <span id="s7">Maiden name Karo.</span> <span id="s8">My husband’s name is Weingarten.</span> <span id="s9">My Jewish name would be Feiga, and in Hebrew Tzipora, meaning “bird.’</span> <span id="s10">But I rarely use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: April 12, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: In what town and country were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: In Lodz, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: What were your parents’, grandparents’ and great-grandparent’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My father’s name was Hirsch Karo.</span> <span id="s17">His wife’s name was Maryam Karo; I don’t know her maiden name.</span> <span id="s18">My mother’s father’s name was Pritzker; I don’t know the first name.</span> <span id="s19">She was raised by a stepfather whose name was Bernard Vasong.</span> <span id="s20">Her mother’s name was Chayeh Vasong, formerly Pritzker.</span> <span id="s21">She and her first husband were divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Where were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My mother was born in Beloya Tserkov, which is a city not far from Kiev in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s24">My father was born in Gostyni, Poland.</span> <span id="s25">My mother was a Polish citizen, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Do you know where your grandparents were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My mother’s mother was born in Beloya Tserkov.</span> <span id="s28">Her first husband, Pritzker, was born and died in Beloya Tserkov.</span> <span id="s29">Her second husband, whom I knew as my grandfather, came from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s30">My father’s mother and father were born in Poland, I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Do you know where your great-grandparents were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: On my father’s side, in Poland.</span> <span id="s33">I know that his ancestors came to Poland probably in the 16th century.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What kind of work did your parents do?</span> <span id="s35">What were their occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My mother did not work outside the house.</span> <span id="s37">She was a housewife, and she took care of running the household.</span> <span id="s38">She didn’t do all the work herself, but she saw to it that it ran smoothly, and she took care of us kids.</span> <span id="s39">My father was an administrative principal in charge of a Jewish boys’ private gymnasium, really two positions.</span> <span id="s40">One was as a director that had to do with the curriculum, and the other one was in charge of the administration.</span> <span id="s41">Gymnasium is a high school, plus two years of junior college.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Would you say your family was secular or religious in practice or orientation?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: In between.</span> <span id="s46">They were not orthodox, they were not terribly observant, and yet tradition was kept, and to say that they were secular would be wrong.</span> <span id="s47">They did follow some of the religious customs.</span> <span id="s48">They kept the holidays.</span> <span id="s49">They identified, I think, much more by being “cultural Jews,’ but there were certain aspects of Jewish religion which were practiced in the house.</span> <span id="s50">They also lived quite a bit according to Jewish ethics and morals.</span> <span id="s51">But they were not observant, and kashrut was kept in a biblical sense.</span> <span id="s52">That is, my mother wouldn’t use milk and meat together, but there were no separate dishes, and no separate silverware.</span> <span id="s53">They belonged to a movement which was called Progressive.</span> <span id="s54">In Polish the expression was Postepowi.</span> <span id="s55">Postepowi means “making strides, modernizing.”</span> <span id="s56">It was not a Reform movement -- there was no formal Reform in Poland -- but in the larger cities of Poland there existed a synagogue like that to which my parents went.</span> <span id="s57">Actually, I should say my father, because in Europe, women did not go very frequently.</span> <span id="s58">The men did.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: That brings us to the next question.</span> <span id="s60">Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s62">A very good education.</span> <span id="s63">I attended a day school for girls.</span> <span id="s64">This was a Jewish organization which founded and funded three schools, two for boys and one for girls.</span> <span id="s65">My father worked in the boys’ school.</span> <span id="s66">We were noted for education.</span> <span id="s67">Most schools in Poland were not, prior to World War II.</span> <span id="s68">The school was the only school in the city of Lodz to be accorded the same rights as a first class Polish school -- Category A.</span> <span id="s69">The language of instruction was Polish; we had Hebrew every day for one to two hours.</span> <span id="s70">And when we had to pass examinations at the end of six years of elementary school, at the end of four years of gymnasium, and at the end of the two junior college classes -- called lyceum -- the examinations were done in two languages, all the subjects in the Polish language, and the Hebraic subjects, such as Hebrew, Hebrew literature, and geography of Palestine, religion, Bible, and so on were all done in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s71">The matriculation certificate was handed out on one side in Polish, on the other side in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s72">So the Jewish education was a very good one.</span> <span id="s73">The school did not indoctrinate.</span> <span id="s74">What you did at home was your own business, but they did give you the education.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What events, either local, national or international, were you aware of from the mid-‘30s to 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Well, I was aware of Polish anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s77">One sensed it, really.</span> <span id="s78">I can’t say I discussed it; I was too young.</span> <span id="s79">I was just barely a child -- adolescent at best – but I remember what was being discussed at home, and I could sense it in the attitudes of the Poles.</span> <span id="s80">I knew that anti-Semitism, which was bad enough, had worsened with the advent of Nazism.</span> <span id="s81">And there was also a rather critical economic situation which affected the Jewish people immediately, not only economically, because anti-Semitism always increases when there are economic difficulties.</span> <span id="s82">And one couldn’t help but read in the papers what was happening to the Jews of Germany.</span> <span id="s83">We also, in 1938, had a large influx of Jews who had been born in Poland but lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s84">They were forcibly thrown over the Polish border.</span> <span id="s85">They were refugees who came to the town of Zbaszyn, and they were called Zbaszyn refugees.</span> <span id="s86">These were people who had lived for many years in Germany, but had originally come from Poland, and the Nazis just rounded them up -- some of them came in robes and slippers --and threw them over the Polish border.</span> <span id="s87">Their fate hung in the air, because the Poles didn’t want them.</span> <span id="s88">Eventually, they were accepted, and sent to different cities in Poland, where the Jewish community and individual Jews helped them.</span> <span id="s89">And so we knew exactly what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s90">We couldn’t say that we didn’t know that Jews were persecuted and robbed of their rights as citizens, and possessions, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Then you and your family had contact with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s93">It so happened that next door to us, there was a Jewish widow with a large apartment, and she accepted a woman, with two little boys, whose husband was killed by the Nazis, and gave her shelter.</span> <span id="s94">Both my parents spoke German fluently, and I recall snatches of conversation -- my mother telling my father what was happening there with the family, and my father helped the boys enter school, at no cost, because the mother couldn’t possibly afford the high fee.</span> <span id="s95">The two boys were accepted to the Jewish gymnasium, and I remember trying to help the little boys with their Polish and lending them some books, because they were learning quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: How was the news that these refugees brought to your community received in your Jewish community, and in your family?</span> <span id="s97">How was that dealt with?</span> <span id="s98">What was the reaction of your family and members of the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s99">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: I was upset.</span> <span id="s101">But in 1938 I was only twelve, and you know you really don’t deal with it very well yet.</span> <span id="s102">My family was very upset, and they realized that things are going to get worse for us, because the war already “lay in the air,’ so to speak.</span> <span id="s103">People failed to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s104">First of all, there wasn’t much that one could do!</span> <span id="s105">Not all of us could leave Poland.</span> <span id="s106">And I think that people refused to believe that the same thing will be happening in Poland.</span> <span id="s107">Don’t forget, this was prior to World War II.</span> <span id="s108">But that we knew what was happening to the Jews in Germany, there is no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What were your sources of information about what was going on, besides the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Newspapers and conversations.</span> <span id="s111">My father and his friends always talked politics.</span> <span id="s112">You couldn’t be living in Poland in the 1930s and not talk politics, and you couldn’t be Jewish and not be concerned with the Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s113">It became worse in the late 1930s, so this was a subject of conversation that was like bread and butter in our house.</span> <span id="s114">What is happening in Germany?</span> <span id="s115">What is happening in Austria?</span> <span id="s116">How is the Nazi government changing?</span> <span id="s117">What is going to happen to the rest of the Jews, all over Europe?</span> <span id="s118">Will there be war, or won’t there be war?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did your family, or you, have any contact with gentiles during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s121">We lived among gentiles, and there was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s122">People seem to think that we lived in ghettos, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s123">Jews clustered in certain areas that were predominantly Jewish simply for comfort, but one was free to live almost anywhere.</span> <span id="s124">Of course, there were certain areas that Jews avoided, because they were a minority, and they were rough areas, but I lived in a very nice residential area where there were some Jews.</span> <span id="s125">I would say about 20 per cent, maybe a little more.</span> <span id="s126">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s127">But it was predominantly Polish and we had Polish neighbors --acquaintances, really.</span> <span id="s128">No one close.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did your family do business with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: We were not in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And did you ever have gentiles in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No, we were pleasant to one another when we met outside, and I used to play with Polish children, the neighbors’ children.</span> <span id="s133">They used to come to my house, and I to their homes.</span> <span id="s134">But my parents, though they were on very good terms with the gentile neighbors -- my father was frequently asked to place somebody on a job, because through his job in school, he knew a great many people, and this was a school where only wealthy Jews could send their children -- it was a costly school -- so there were a lot of manufacturers, and more than once he found a job this way for someone, for Jewish friends, Jewish acquaintances, as well as our Polish neighbors and acquaintances.</span> <span id="s135">But it was a distant, though pleasant contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">QL Did you have relatives that lived outside your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s138">My father came from a very large family.</span> <span id="s139">He was the eldest of seven brothers, and the oldest one was a sister.</span> <span id="s140">They all lived in the area of Kutno, which was some distance from Lodz.</span> <span id="s141">I only met them now and then when we would go to visit, or they would come to visit us.</span> <span id="s142">I don’t remember them very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Do you know what became of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: After the war, I tried to find out what happened to people who lived in that area.</span> <span id="s145">They lived in smaller towns.</span> <span id="s146">I had an uncle who lived in Plotsk.</span> <span id="s147">I had an uncle who lived in Kitno.</span> <span id="s148">Another one in Zychlin.</span> <span id="s149">They were all taken to the death camp of Treblinka, where nobody survived.</span> <span id="s150">There isn’t a cousin left.</span> <span id="s151">They were all married men with wives and children.</span> <span id="s152">My grandmother had gone to her death probably with the youngest son and his wife and child who lived with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: And that was Treblinka, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Probably Treblinka.</span> <span id="s155">I never could find out for sure, but I know that people from that area were ghettoized for a short time in one of the larger towns and then, when the Nazis began to liquidate the Jews in Poland in 1941, they were taken to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What age were you at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Thirteen-and-a-half.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And how did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: When we went into the ghetto, sometime during that winter I looked through some of the things that I was able to take with, and one of my notebooks fell into my hands where I had written about the war in school, right at the outbreak of the war, shortly after Poland fell.</span> <span id="s160">And I was laughing at myself, how optimistic I was that Poland would win.</span> <span id="s161">Poland fell in two weeks!</span> <span id="s162">We didn’t realize the war would last, that it would be so horrible on the civilian population.</span> <span id="s163">And though we realized that the Nazis hated us and they meant us no good, nobody in their right mind would have been able to foresee what eventually was done to us.</span> <span id="s164">How could we know what lay ahead of us, when the Nazis themselves didn’t plan the extermination of the Jews until they went to war with the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: So you were in the ghetto then, at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No!</span> <span id="s167">We were still in our home in Lodz, in the city.</span> <span id="s168">We were ghettoized at the end of 1939, and my father and my mother and I went into the ghetto in January, in 1940.</span> <span id="s169">My father was arrested in October of 1939 as a member of the Jewish intelligentsia, and we didn’t see him until the very end of December.</span> <span id="s170">He came out sick, and had to spend some time in a hospital, probably three to four weeks.</span> <span id="s171">In the meantime, my mother and I tried to take a few possessions into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s172">Because the owner was Jewish, he no longer could function as an owner, and somebody else, a so-called “treuhaender” (custodian) was in charge of the building, and collected the rents.</span> <span id="s173">If you prepaid three months in advance, you could take a few sticks of furniture and some private possessions.</span> <span id="s174">Our furniture was very big and very heavy, and there was no way we could carry it.</span> <span id="s175">We were not permitted to hire a wagon.</span> <span id="s176">You had to take it on a sled, or on your back.</span> <span id="s177">So we took two beds, my sister’s and mine, which were small, and disassembled, and dragged the mattresses on a sled with the help of a Pole who lived in our building, who was a very poor man and always ready to do some small jobs for a fee.</span> <span id="s178">We took the bare necessities and our clothing with us.</span> <span id="s179">And the rest had to be left where it was.</span> <span id="s180">I think it was the very end of January when my father recovered from the beating and the terrible food they gave him in prison, and joined us in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Where was the prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s183">It was in the city.</span> <span id="s184">There were many Poles in the same cell with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: What was the discussion, when the war did break out, among your family, or the Jewish community, about the war, and what was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Well, we naively thought maybe Poland would win, because we were hoping that England and France would come to the rescue.</span> <span id="s187">They had a pact to help.</span> <span id="s188">Nobody realized the power and the might and the speed with which the German army would move.</span> <span id="s189">We did not foresee the horror of the Nazi occupation.</span> <span id="s190">We Jews were used to persecution, and learned to live with it and cope.</span> <span id="s191">We thought it would be a worse persecution than ever before, but nobody realized how horrible it really would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And when did that occur -- the Nazi occupation of your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Right after Poland lost.</span> <span id="s194">On October first.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: What actions did the German forces take in the early months or years of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: There were so many laws against the population.</span> <span id="s197">They were issued one at a time, two at a time, in the newspapers, and they were posted all over town.</span> <span id="s198">There were two sets of laws, one for the Poles, and one for the Jews, and of course the laws laid against us were always much more severe.</span> <span id="s199">The curfew for the Poles was seven in the streets -- for the Jews till five.</span> <span id="s200">We had to wear a yellow armband, which later on was changed to a yellow Star of David on the left breast, and on the right side of the back, and on our apartments or homes, so they could easily identify who was Jewish and come in.</span> <span id="s201">They helped themselves to everything we had.</span> <span id="s202">And these were plain soldiers who were quartered in the buildings.</span> <span id="s203">The German army was quartered in the better and nicer Jewish sections and apartments, and when they needed utensils or food, or when they needed somebody to clean their floors or windows, they helped themselves to Jewish people and Jewish goods.</span> <span id="s204">We had to give up our jewelry and furs, and little by little we became denuded, robbed of everything we owned.</span> <span id="s205">Our bank accounts were frozen in the banks.</span> <span id="s206">And then, I think it was in November, the edicts were issued telling us to leave our apartments, our homes in the city, and to go to a slum area called Baluty, which was designated to be the ghetto.</span> <span id="s207">In April -- the reason why I remember this is because it was the day of my 14th birthday, April 12th, 1940 - they threw barbed wire around the ghetto, dividing the ghetto from the rest of the city, and put heavily armed guards all around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What was life like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: It was bad, and it continued to go from bad to worse.</span> <span id="s210">The food situation was horrible.</span> <span id="s211">There were at least 160,000 people who went in there, into a very small area.</span> <span id="s212">Often in a larger room there were two families.</span> <span id="s213">We had a tiny little room for the three of us, no bigger than a bathroom.</span> <span id="s214">But the worst were disease and malnutrition, because the ration was small, and became smaller and smaller, until in 1942, one couldn’t live very long on it.</span> <span id="s215">It was very, very little.</span> <span id="s216">And hard labor!</span> <span id="s217">The reason why they permitted us to live, was because they used us.</span> <span id="s218">We were a highly skilled people in an industrial city, and everybody had to work 12 hours day or night, in shifts.</span> <span id="s219">At first it was from 14 to 55, and then they said from the age of 9 until the age of 65.</span> <span id="s220">And if one didn’t work, one didn’t get the ration card, so one was as good as dead.</span> <span id="s221">One couldn’t live on the ration very long anyway, because it meant only a little bit of bread and a watery soup which was cooked in the factories or the offices where we worked, and issued at work.</span> <span id="s222">It wasn’t very filling, because it was just lukewarm water with maybe a bit of vegetable or some potato floating in it.</span> <span id="s223">Very rarely were we issued a piece of meat.</span> <span id="s224">Almost never an egg or butter.</span> <span id="s225">There was a bit of margarine, and then later on, no margarine, just a very smelly, low-grade oil.</span> <span id="s226">It was at best probably no more than 500 calories, and in ’42, ’43, ’44, much less than that, so that people actually starved to death.</span> <span id="s227">And there was no heating fuel, so we lived in ice palaces, and you had to hack through ice in order to wash yourself -- if you had the strength.</span> <span id="s228">And you had to work.</span> <span id="s229">But there were some places of work in the ghetto which were not as bad, where there was a little bit of food, and one could illegally help oneself to that bit of food.</span> <span id="s230">Some physical labor was backbreaking, some labor was not that difficult.</span> <span id="s231">It all depended how lucky one was and what connections one had, because within the ghetto we were ruled by a Jewish man, Chaim Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s232">He was the “eldester” of the Judenrat, our representative.</span> <span id="s233">And we also had people who were in charge of us who were Jewish people who were highly skilled and were bosses of the different sections of the work force in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s234">So our survival depended primarily on our skills, on the fact that the SS wanted to kill us, but the army needed us and kept some of us alive.</span> <span id="s235">And if one had the right acquaintances in the ghetto, it helped, so that one could try and get a better job.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: At first I went to school.</span> <span id="s238">The Nazis didn’t know about it, but I went to school for quite a while.</span> <span id="s239">In the beginning we had one high school.</span> <span id="s240">They gathered all the children from different schools, and the students formed one school which functioned on three shifts.</span> <span id="s241">Then, when the schools were closed and all of us, from the age of nine, had to start working, the school department saw to it that there was some education -- again, secret -- in the factories.</span> <span id="s242">Little kids from 9 to 14 would have to work five hours a day, but had several hours of instruction.</span> <span id="s243">The instruction was primarily in Yiddish, so the children at least could be literate.</span> <span id="s244">We tried the best we could.</span> <span id="s245">I worked five hours a day until I reached the age of 15, and then I had to work 12 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Doing what kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: At first I worked five hours a day making decorations for ladies’ hats in a hat factory.</span> <span id="s248">Then I became very ill with typhus, the intestinal kind.</span> <span id="s249">When I got well, I received a good job where I could eat a little bit -- in a bakery, where, for the work that I did, I was given an extra bread ration.</span> <span id="s250">That job was given to me through an acquaintance.</span> <span id="s251">It was a job only for three months.</span> <span id="s252">And then later on I worked in a kitchen.</span> <span id="s253">Again, I could eat a little better, and leave part of my ration for my parents.</span> <span id="s254">Later on my mother became quite ill from malnutrition, and I had to look for a job which was less demanding, so I could come and help her a bit.</span> <span id="s255">And I worked in the office of a laundry.</span> <span id="s256">Then, in August of 1944, all ceased.</span> <span id="s257">We were deported.</span> <span id="s258">There were deportations all the time from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Before we talk about the deportations, while you were in the ghetto, were you receiving any news about what was happening with the concentration camps, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s261">We had no newspaper and no official information.</span> <span id="s262">There was some unofficial information; I didn’t know until very late, in 1944, that there were several secret radios, and this was how we had some information.</span> <span id="s263">There were no labor parties going out from the ghetto, and no Poles coming into the ghetto, so there was very little information.</span> <span id="s264">I had absolutely no idea of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s265">What we did know was that people were sent away -- periodically, there were hundreds, or a few thousand, demanded for labor, for so-called resettlement and labor camps -- but very rarely did they come back alive.</span> <span id="s266">Once or twice a transport would stop en route and the people were skeletons.</span> <span id="s267">They were telling of horrible beatings and torture and hunger of the sort which made the ghetto seem better in comparison, so one dreaded these resettlements, these labor camps.</span> <span id="s268">But they were not called concentration camps.</span> <span id="s269">The words “Konzentrationslager” or “Vernichtungslager” were not used.</span> <span id="s270">It was called “arbeitslager” -- work camp -- and we dreaded them.</span> <span id="s271">It was only when I came to Aucshwitz that I found out what it was all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: When was that, and how it happen that you were taken to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I belonged to this group of Jews that stayed in the ghetto until the end, because some of us were needed for work.</span> <span id="s274">September, 1944, there was about 70,000 of us still left alive, or barely alive.</span> <span id="s275">A work force, a skeleton of a work force, left.</span> <span id="s276">In ’44 the Russian army was marching.</span> <span id="s277">Already parts of eastern Poland were under Russian control, and we could hear guns.</span> <span id="s278">We knew the fighting was already in the area of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s279">Warsaw’s not that far from Lodz.</span> <span id="s280">You could hear the guns, the firing, and we were hoping that the SS will leave us alone -- that remnant -- because they certainly didn’t leave us alone before.</span> <span id="s281">All the time there were deportations.</span> <span id="s282">In ’42, they went for a whole week from house to house.</span> <span id="s283">It was called “Gehsperre” -- that means “house arrest.”</span> <span id="s284">They took all the children away, and the people from the insane asylum, and the people from the hospitals, and anybody who was emaciated.</span> <span id="s285">We were hoping that the remnant will be able to survive, we among them -- my mother, my father and I -- because the war was at the end.</span> <span id="s286">However it didn’t happen that way.</span> <span id="s287">I’m sure that you’re aware that there was a Polish uprising in the city of Warsaw, and the Russians, who were already in a suburb of Warsaw, Praga, stopped their offensive for three months and let the Poles fight on by themselves, while the Nazis slaughtered half the city and deported hundreds of thousands of Poles.</span> <span id="s288">This gave the SS time to clean out the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s289">They issued laws.</span> <span id="s290">They told us to gather in certain places and to come with 25 kilograms in our knapsacks, because we’re going to be resettled.</span> <span id="s291">The German responsible for the ghetto, the Commandant, Hans Biebow – he was apprehended after the war, extradited, and stood trial, and was hanged by the Poles -- he opened his suitcase, and he said, “ See, I have no guns.</span> <span id="s292">I’ve been your friend.</span> <span id="s293">We are going to resettle you, to save you from the incoming Red Army.”</span> <span id="s294">Some friend!</span> <span id="s295">To us they were saviors; they were liberators!</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: They carried you altogether, to one spot?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: They didn’t.</span> <span id="s298">We started to hide, and they started to come in from morning till late at night with fully armed soldiers.</span> <span id="s299">When they didn’t have enough SS, they brought in special police detachments, and they went from house to house, from basement to attic, flushing out whoever was hiding.</span> <span id="s300">Some people didn’t hide, because one received a loaf of bread if one went willingly, and people were starving to death.</span> <span id="s301">We were found on August 16.</span> <span id="s302">We were hiding out in my father’s office, hoping that we won’t be discovered, because this was on the second floor.</span> <span id="s303">On the first floor there was a police office, Jewish police, and we thought they wouldn’t come there.</span> <span id="s304">But my father’s manager of the office had a child who cried, and they heard him, and they came and took us.</span> <span id="s305">They just said, “Raus!”</span> <span id="s306">-- Out!</span> <span id="s307">And “Line up!”</span> <span id="s308">They surrounded us with soldiers and took us to the depot and shoved us into waiting cattle trains.</span> <span id="s309">We traveled overnight, and the next day, in the morning, we arrived in a place which I leaned later on was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s310">As the locked, bolted doors were opened by strange-looking men in striped uniforms with shaven heads, somebody leaned against the wall and found a piece of paper stuck between the slats, and he read it aloud.</span> <span id="s311">In Yiddish, it said, “Brothers, save yourselves!</span> <span id="s312">This is death.</span> <span id="s313">Death awaits you.”</span> <span id="s314">But it was too late.</span> <span id="s315">We had already arrived.</span> <span id="s316">There wasn’t a thing we could do.</span> <span id="s317">And even if we had found it earlier, where could one run?</span> <span id="s318">Into the hands of the waiting Poles?</span> <span id="s319">The Poles were not very anxious to help us.</span> <span id="s320">At night we stopped once, and we heard Polish voices under the train, obviously Polish workmen, and we asked, “Where are we going?</span> <span id="s321">Do you know where they are taking us?</span> <span id="s322">We are Jews from the ghetto of Lodz.’</span> <span id="s323">They didn’t answer, but they said, “If you have any valuables, make a hole in the floor and throw it to us.”</span> <span id="s324">There wasn’t an offer of food or water, or of information.</span> <span id="s325">We were going to Auschwitz, and they knew it very well.</span> <span id="s326">It wasn’t that far, and they were railroad workmen who watched trains go by there for a very long time.</span> <span id="s327">And there wasn’t a word of warning.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: So what month or day did you arrive, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: August 17, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And who were the people that accompanied you at your arrival?</span> <span id="s331">Were you all from the same ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s333">There were some classmates, some neighbors, some acquaintances, some strangers.</span> <span id="s334">It depended, you know, with whom you were caught on a certain day.</span> <span id="s335">Some people were caught right on the street.</span> <span id="s336">As a matter of fact, about a week before I was deported, a friend of mine, a classmate of mine who’s now in Israel, was caught in the street.</span> <span id="s337">She didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye to her widowed mother.</span> <span id="s338">And when I came to Auschwitz, after the selections we were walking the road into the camp, and I heard my name.</span> <span id="s339">My name in Polish is Lusia, and somebody was hollering, “Lusia!</span> <span id="s340">Lusia!</span> <span id="s341">: I looked up, and behind the high, tall, barbed electrified wire, there stood a creature in a ballerina outfit with a shaven head.</span> <span id="s342">I didn’t know who it was.</span> <span id="s343">She started calling my name again and again, and I recognized the voice.</span> <span id="s344">It was a friend.</span> <span id="s345">Her name is -- was -- Nicia.</span> <span id="s346">She was caught in the street, too.</span> <span id="s347">I knew then where I came, that this is where everybody from the ghetto was sent.</span> <span id="s348">This is where she disappeared to.</span> <span id="s349">And she hollered to me, “Throw me some bread.</span> <span id="s350">I’m starving!”</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: How were you processed or registered into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I wasn’t registered.</span> <span id="s353">There were so many of us coming.</span> <span id="s354">There was still the tail-end of the Hungarian Jews arriving, and our ghetto.</span> <span id="s355">We went through the selection for life and death immediately upon descending from the train.</span> <span id="s356">After we were told to form into lines, men and women separately, it went very quickly.</span> <span id="s357">Probably in about an hour I stood in front of a table.</span> <span id="s358">There were probably four or five German officers who would look at one and just with a flicker of a finger send you to the right or to the left.</span> <span id="s359">I was not registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: What were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: I was waved to the left, which meant life -- which of course I didn’t realize at the time.</span> <span id="s362">I didn’t know who went to the right, and why.</span> <span id="s363">I could only see from the corner of my eye, that these were women with children, elderly, sick people, grey-haired people, people who were crippled, young women who were walking with middle-aged women.</span> <span id="s364">And to the left, I saw younger women.</span> <span id="s365">My mother walked with a friend of mine ahead of me.</span> <span id="s366">I walked behind her.</span> <span id="s367">I didn’t realize how close I came to being sent to the right, because I switched places.</span> <span id="s368">I walked with my friend’s mother, who was a tiny, grey-haired lady, and my mother, who was tall and handsome with dark hair, walked with my friend.</span> <span id="s369">They were waved, just a few steps ahead of me, to the left.</span> <span id="s370">And when I came to the table, one of the German officers looked at this small grey-haired lady, and he asked me, “Is this your mother?’</span> <span id="s371">“Ist dis dein Mutter?’</span> <span id="s372">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s373">He waved her to the right, and he looked at me again, and he said, ‘Bei alt bist du?’</span> <span id="s374">“How old are you?”</span> <span id="s375">I said, “Eighteen.’</span> <span id="s376">And he said, “Old enough.”</span> <span id="s377">I understood He meant “old enough to labor.”</span> <span id="s378">I wasn’t a little kid, and I could work.</span> <span id="s379">I was sent with the others to the left, and we were sent to the transit camp, the so-called “Ausgangslager” in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s380">We walked for several miles.</span> <span id="s381">All along the road on both sides I saw emaciated men, non-Jews, Poles, mostly.</span> <span id="s382">They asked us in Polish to throw any valuables and any food we had.</span> <span id="s383">They saw that some of us carried some bread.</span> <span id="s384">They said, “It will be taken away from you, anyway.”</span> <span id="s385">I threw away what I had.</span> <span id="s386">I couldn’t bend down and give it to them, because we were forbidden to talk to them and we passed very quickly, but as unobtrusively as I could, I threw away two loaves of bread I had.</span> <span id="s387">Then we walked into a bath installation.</span> <span id="s388">We were told to undress completely and line up and give up our jewelry.</span> <span id="s389">I had a watch and I had a very lovely small diamond ring, my mother’s engagement ring.</span> <span id="s390">I didn’t want to give it to the SS.</span> <span id="s391">I just threw it in a corner.</span> <span id="s392">And they looked in our crevices, in the mouth, and elsewhere, to see if one didn’t hide jewelry or money.</span> <span id="s393">Not German money or ghetto money, which had no value, but gold, dollars, and so on.</span> <span id="s394">And then they cut our hair, and slapped us with a dirty rag with some fluid in it.</span> <span id="s395">Probably it was supposed to disinfect us, but it was just awful, dirty water and a dirty rag.</span> <span id="s396">And then they shoved us into a bath hall.</span> <span id="s397">Fortunately cold water came out.</span> <span id="s398">Then we stood shivering, in another room.</span> <span id="s399">They left us alone, and after several hours they issued either striped uniforms or a ragged, very torn piece of civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s400">Then we were told to line up, and we marched for several miles again to another part of the camp -- into barracks number 20, I recall -- and we were seated, packed like sardines, in fives.</span> <span id="s401">We were seated with our legs crossed.</span> <span id="s402">You’d open your knees, and somebody would sit between your knees, until we formed five.</span> <span id="s403">And the next five, and the next, to the left, and to the right.</span> <span id="s404">We could not get up and we could not go out to the latrine without permission.</span> <span id="s405">We had to sit very quietly, without making any noise.</span> <span id="s406">And that night, when we started to be very tired from sitting in this position, we started to complain and cry, and to inquire about the people who went to the right.</span> <span id="s407">There was a kind of stove, a long low stove, built almost through the length of the barracks.</span> <span id="s408">We sat in what looked almost like stalls, on the bare floor.</span> <span id="s409">There were no bunks in that particular camp.</span> <span id="s410">Several young Jewish girls ran out, and in German and in Slovak, which is similar to the Polish language, they informed us where we were.</span> <span id="s411">They told us to stop screaming and yelling.</span> <span id="s412">They told us that we had arrived in Auschwitz, and that this is a death camp.</span> <span id="s413">And they said, “Be quiet and mind us, because if you are loud, you’ll bring the SS on us, and we will not pay with our lives for you!”</span> <span id="s414">Two of them pointed to their arms and legs, which were marked by scars.</span> <span id="s415">They said they came in a transport of 3,000 girls from Slovakia, and spotted typhus broke out, and they were quarantined without food and water.</span> <span id="s416">They drank their own urine to save themselves, and less than 30 girls survived!</span> <span id="s417">They said they’d been through hell, and we had to mind and obey them.</span> <span id="s418">Otherwise the SS would come running.</span> <span id="s419">When they said, “this is a death camp,” I recall trying to understand what these words meant.</span> <span id="s420">I know what death is, and I know what camp is.</span> <span id="s421">They used the German expression, Feindichtenslager,” but I still could not comprehend exactly what was meant by it, because how can a human mind comprehend that human beings are destroying other human beings just because they’re Jews, whether by gas and burning in the crematoria, or by bullets.</span> <span id="s422">I didn’t know about the crematoria right away, but I found out after several days.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Who were the other people in your barracks?</span> <span id="s424">Were they from your same ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes, those that were selected for life.</span> <span id="s426">Everybody was missing somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What was the composition of the camp population?</span> <span id="s428">Do you have any idea about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: I stayed there only a week.</span> <span id="s430">Otherwise I would not have survived very long.</span> <span id="s431">There were men and women, and many nationalities.</span> <span id="s432">The ones I met were mostly Jewish women from Poland and Hungary.</span> <span id="s433">Later on I would meet Jewish women from every Nazi-occupied country of Europe.</span> <span id="s434">There were also gentiles, a lot of Poles, a lot of Ukrainians, and other nationalities as well.</span> <span id="s435">My contact was mostly with other Jewish prisoners and Jewish overseers.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Was there any difference between the treatment of the Jewish and the non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Absolutely!</span> <span id="s438">As badly as everyone was treated, the Jews were always treated worse, and the gassing and the crematoria were mainly for the Jews.</span> <span id="s439">The other prisoners were rarely gassed and sent to the crematoria; they were often tortured and shot.</span> <span id="s440">It didn’t take much to be tortured or mistreated by the Nazis, but the “customers” for the gas chambers and the crematoria were the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Did you have any encounter with gypsies, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, baptized Jews, or Soviet prisoners in the other camps you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s443">Later on, when I was sent to branches of Auschwitz to do labor --– smaller camps -- I worked with Soviet prisoners of war and other prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s444">I had contact with some of the German women who were Kapos.</span> <span id="s445">Some of them were lesbians.</span> <span id="s446">I saw quite a few German Kapos in Auschwitz, and they were homosexuals.</span> <span id="s447">I didn’t have any contact with them, because they were in the men’s camp, but I saw them.</span> <span id="s448">And I was with gypsies at the end, in the last camp, in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s449">They sat vis-à-vis from me on the filthy floor of the barracks, a whole group of Poles, Ukrainian, and several German gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What acts were you witness to, or aware of, about systematic killing and fatalities from other causes?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: There were beatings, constant beatings.</span> <span id="s452">And there were constant selections, even after the first one, the main one.</span> <span id="s453">Every day we were looked at, at least once or twice, and they were weeding out those that were becoming weakened or emaciated, separating mothers and daughters or sisters who by chance missed being spotted as relatives -- they separated families -- and they were never seen again.</span> <span id="s454">As I said, on the third or fourth day, I found out that the people whom one never saw again went to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s455">Later on in the camps, I saw people die of hunger.</span> <span id="s456">And in Belsen, I saw hundreds of thousands dying of malnutrition, disease and lack of medical care, and bodies, skeletal bodies, mounds of them, between barracks and at several points in the camp, among them my mother.</span> <span id="s457">Nobody could bury them, nobody had the strength to hack through the frozen earth, and they were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s458">In some of the barracks, the dead outnumbered the living.</span> <span id="s459">I had an acquaintance who lives in Detroit.</span> <span id="s460">She was the only survivor in her whole barracks.</span> <span id="s461">When they went in, there were probably a thousand or 1,400 women and she was the only one who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Was there a way of communicating between people in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Oh, yes, if you were in the same barracks, in the same camp.</span> <span id="s464">If you were in a different barracks, it was often difficult, because we were not permitted much freedom in the camp.</span> <span id="s465">You could exchange a word or two during work, or in the latrine.</span> <span id="s466">This was the only place where one could exchange some information or meet a friend -- in the latrines.</span> <span id="s467">But if the friend was in a different part of the camp, a different barracks, there was much more difficulty.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Were you aware at all, of the ongoing war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: How did you receive information about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: When I was sent from Auschwitz after a week.</span> <span id="s472">There was a demand for Jewish women, Jewish labor, in the branches of Auschwitz, and I was sent to an airplane factory in Bad Kudova, which is Poland now -- then it was Germany.</span> <span id="s473">There were several thousand other prisoners.</span> <span id="s474">Prisoners of war from Russia.</span> <span id="s475">Italian prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s476">Civilian slave laborers, men and women from Czechoslovakia, and from Holland.</span> <span id="s477">So there were a lot of civilians who tried to cheer us up, though they were not permitted to speak to us.</span> <span id="s478">If we were caught speaking to anybody, we were beaten or deprived of the ration, so we had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s479">But speak with them we did, nevertheless.</span> <span id="s480">They were the ones who informed us that the war is at the end, to hold out and not to give up hope, because the Germans are being beaten, and are losing.</span> <span id="s481">Also, I realized things must be very bad for the Nazis, because the foremen, who was an elderly man -- most of the younger men were at the front, so the older men had to go back to work -- he came over to my mother, who worked at a nearby machine -- my mother spoke a very fluent, fine German, and he could probably tell this was a nice middle-aged woman, and he knew that she spoke the language very well -- he came up to her with a notebook, and he said, “I’d appreciate very much if you would sign your name in this notebook, and if you would say that I treated you well, and I never hit you, and that I treated you with as much humanity as I could.”</span> <span id="s482">And I realized that, if a German foreman is that scared, the war must be close to an end.</span> <span id="s483">He was trying to assure himself that he will have some proof that he wasn’t inhuman, because he knew that they were losing and that things will go badly with anyone who had contact with the prisoners.</span> <span id="s484">He wanted to present proof of his “humanity” to the Allies!</span> <span id="s485">And when the Nazis did that, I knew they were scared.</span> <span id="s486">I also could tell that they were scared because their brutality towards us was even worse than before.</span> <span id="s487">The closer it got to the end of the war, the more vicious they became.</span> <span id="s488">In Belsen, towards the end, in March of 1945, they did not distribute any of the horrible food any more, and we were for days without food.</span> <span id="s489">And since the supply of clean water was very small, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s490">Most of us were feverish from typhus and needed water.</span> <span id="s491">It was just a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s492">When I recall Bergen-Belsen, it’s just like one empty, huge field with dead and dying bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: What were the names of the major German personnel in the camps you were in, such as the commander and the officers?</span> <span id="s494">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A; When I was sent to Auschwitz, the woman in charge was Irma Greiser.</span> <span id="s496">I remember when I was sent to Bad Kudova, the SS woman in charge, the Kommando fuehrerein, her first name was Lucy.</span> <span id="s497">But I don’t know any other names.</span> <span id="s498">I was switched from place to place, and I was in such fear of them.</span> <span id="s499">And naturally, of course, they didn’t tell us their names.</span> <span id="s500">They would tell us their rank and tell us to stand at attention and give us all kinds of orders, but they never introduced themselves by name.</span> <span id="s501">We would occasionally find out a name accidentally, when we heard the German SS calling each other by name, so as a result, I knew a lot of first names, but I don’t know very many last names.</span> <span id="s502">If I do, it’s from reading history after the war; I informed myself who was who and in charge of what camp.</span> <span id="s503">But at the time, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s504">I could tell they were SS by the insignia on their uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Can you recall specific accounts of behavior and actions of specific German personnel?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: As far as the military, the people that I came in contact with were mostly SS.</span> <span id="s507">There were some auxiliary SS, and some volunteers in the SS.</span> <span id="s508">They were very cruel, but even among the SS, I remember twice an act of decency.</span> <span id="s509">Once a Hungarian girl was bending down, and she was very dirty.</span> <span id="s510">The Hungarian girls came into the camps and broke down almost immediately, because they came from rather normal circumstances, and they were not prepared for starvation and brutal treatment, where we in the ghetto already had a long exposure to hunger.</span> <span id="s511">And one of the German engineers -- there were two younger men, obviously they were indispensable and they had to be there, otherwise they would be at the front -- started to laugh.</span> <span id="s512">And the SS woman --we were guarded every few meters -- she was a fine looking woman, a young woman with delicate features, and she said to this engineer, “You ought to be ashamed of yourself, making fun of this poor creature.”</span> <span id="s513">And I thought, “How decent of her.</span> <span id="s514">She’s a woman who is offended by the fact that this man was laughing at this young Hungarian doing menial work, bending down so that her dirty legs, and her dirty --whatever she was wearing underneath -- showed.”</span> <span id="s515">I didn’t expect such humanity from an SS woman.</span> <span id="s516">The second time was in another camp where, as punishment, the SS woman got mad at somebody in the group, for nothing, really, and she was asking her, “Did you have children?’</span> <span id="s517">the woman said, “Yes, I had a child, who was taken away from me in Auschwitz.’</span> <span id="s518">And the SS woman said to her, “I would never give up my child.”</span> <span id="s519">The woman was afraid to tell her, “I didn’t give her up.</span> <span id="s520">She was taken.”</span> <span id="s521">She just cried.</span> <span id="s522">The SS woman became very angry and she said, “Take off your coat!”</span> <span id="s523">We did get a coat, and the ragged dress or uniform, and a coat.</span> <span id="s524">And she made her work without a coat, and the woman was freezing.</span> <span id="s525">About an hour later, another SS woman came to relieve this cruel one.</span> <span id="s526">She was an elderly woman.</span> <span id="s527">And when she saw this poor woman’s face, which was blue, and her fingers totally frozen -- we worked without gloves, because we were not issued gloves, but the SS wore two pairs of gloves – she removed a pair of gloves and said to the woman, “ You can keep them.’</span> <span id="s528">We looked at her in astonishment, and she said, very quietly, with tears in her eyes, “I have a son who is fighting on the eastern front in Russia, and I hope perhaps somebody will be kind to him, too.”</span> <span id="s529">These were the only two acts of kindness that I saw in the SS in all the time that I had the disadvantage of being in their hands.</span> <span id="s530">And as far as the civilians, outside of the elderly foreman who wanted to have my mother sign that he was quite humane, I don’t recall any acts of kindness.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: I was just talking about actions, period.</span> <span id="s532">You know, that’s fine, the acts of kindness, but any specific actions or behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: When we came for the first time to the factory --this munitions factory in Bad Kudova -- civilians were lined up on the street all along the way, almost up to the doors of the huge factory.</span> <span id="s534">They stood there and made fun of us.</span> <span id="s535">They called us, in German, “offenmenschen” and “lumpenfrauen,” which means “monkey people” and “rag people,” because we were wearing ragged dresses and our heads were shaven.</span> <span id="s536">They were making fun of us, and they were cruel, and they were mean, and they were ugly!</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: You mentioned the SS.</span> <span id="s538">Do you recall any other units of the German army or Nazi police while you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Police, yes.</span> <span id="s540">During the deportation, they didn’t have enough SS, so they brought in the police.</span> <span id="s541">They brought in a lot of special detachments that were not necessarily SS.</span> <span id="s542">I couldn’t tell you exactly who they were.</span> <span id="s543">I remember the color of the uniforms, but I was so scared of them, who had time to look up at the insignia?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: What thoughts did you give to your survival when you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: I tried not to think in specifics.</span> <span id="s546">I just tried to stay clean, if possible, to scrounge around for extra food if possible, to help my mother, because I adjusted a lot better to life in the concentration camps -- my mother was 48, I was just 18 -- and to help her survive.</span> <span id="s547">When I was on the death march in February, 1945 -- I was in a smaller camp, now in the vicinity of the city of Breslau, and they again drove us away from the oncoming Russian army – we walked through the snows of Germany, and they said that whoever lags in the march would be shot.</span> <span id="s548">I was afraid my mother couldn’t walk as fast.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t know how she made those three days.</span> <span id="s550">I think love drove her on, because she knew that if she would stagger, or if she would sit down, I would stay with her, and they would shoot both of us.</span> <span id="s551">We could see blood in the snow, and we knew they did it, because we realized they were driving a lot of prisoners from other camps ahead of us, behind us, and so on.</span> <span id="s552">And after three days, they dumped us onto open coal trains.</span> <span id="s553">They drove us around Germany, trying to find a camp that could still absorb more prisoners, and I ended up in one of the last trains that were detached, in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s554">I found out that this was the town of Bergen-Belsen, and a few kilometers away from this little town, there was the huge camp, which originally was a transit camp, and in ’44 became a dumping ground for survivors from other camps.</span> <span id="s555">There were a lot of Jewish women there from other camps.</span> <span id="s556">They simply dropped us there and hardly fed us, and at the end did not distribute any food.</span> <span id="s557">There was very little drinking water, a lot of lice, and no work.</span> <span id="s558">And we began to die, die of disease and starvation.</span> <span id="s559">It was a slow process.</span> <span id="s560">One became thinner and thinner and thinner until one became a skeleton, and one died either walking or sitting where one sat, in the filthy barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And in the meantime, you didn’t know what was becoming of your other family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No.</span> <span id="s563">I realized that my father, if he was permitted to live in Auschwitz, then he was probably in another camp.</span> <span id="s564">And I had a feeling he passed the selections, because I saw a line of men as we were leaving the bath installation, and I saw my father in that line.</span> <span id="s565">I wasn’t sure whether he survived his sojourn in Auschwitz, and how long he stayed there, but if he were sent away from Auschwitz, I doubted very much that he’s be able to survive.</span> <span id="s566">I was in good physical condition, I was young, and my parents saw to it that I ate a little better, because they gave me food from their ration.</span> <span id="s567">But he was 52.</span> <span id="s568">He was emaciated, had lost a tremendous amount of weight in the ghetto, was exhausted physically, and was really not accustomed to heavy physical labor.</span> <span id="s569">I doubted very much that he would survive, and unfortunately, I was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: My mother had a chance as long as we didn’t come to Belsen.</span> <span id="s572">Once we came to Belsen, I knew that we would not get out alive, because there was no work and we were fed infrequently, and there was no way one could help oneself.</span> <span id="s573">And before I knew it, after a week or two, I realized we both became sick, because I was conscious only some of the time, partially.</span> <span id="s574">When I was burning up, I realized I had fever.</span> <span id="s575">I looked at my body and I saw red spots, and I realized immediately that we both had the typhus, which was carried by lice.</span> <span id="s576">The symptoms are little red spots on your body, and a high temperature.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: So your mother died then, in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s579">She died, because I had no water for her, and no medical care.</span> <span id="s580">She probably would have lived, had I been able to save her, but I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s581">I was sick myself.</span> <span id="s582">There was no water.</span> <span id="s583">I was not in the same group that I was deported from the ghetto with, friends and acquaintances.</span> <span id="s584">I was switched from camp to camp, and I found myself, with a group of almost total strangers, and there wasn’t time to develop any ties.</span> <span id="s585">My mother and I were totally dependent on one another, and when she became ill, and I became ill almost right after, there was no one to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: And how long were you there, at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I came in February.</span> <span id="s588">I knew the month, but who knew the day?</span> <span id="s589">I was freed on April 15, 1945, by the British army.</span> <span id="s590">I was close to death from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s591">I had survived the typhus.</span> <span id="s592">My fever had gone down.</span> <span id="s593">My head cleared.</span> <span id="s594">I was totally lucid and conscious.</span> <span id="s595">But I could only walk a few steps.</span> <span id="s596">I was so thin that I was totally unrecognizable.</span> <span id="s597">I could not talk above a whisper, and I was dying of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s598">I don’t know how long -- a few days, a week, not much longer -- and I would have died, just sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: What kind of care did you get then?</span> <span id="s600">What happened after Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: When the British came, they tried to take out, of course, the very sick ones and the dead ones, and bury the dead ones with bulldozers.</span> <span id="s602">Physicians came in, donning workmens’s uniforms and gas masks, because we stank.</span> <span id="s603">There were women dying in their own excrement and lice, and they realized they’d become infected.</span> <span id="s604">They were afraid to touch us, because many had scabies, and that’s highly contagious.</span> <span id="s605">They would look us over, with a stethoscope, but really not listening, and determine just by looking.</span> <span id="s606">One looked at me, and he said, “you’re okay.”</span> <span id="s607">That meant I was better off than some of the others.</span> <span id="s608">At least I could walk a few steps.</span> <span id="s609">After the healthy ones were taken to a different camp, and the sick ones to makeshift hospitals, this camp was burned.</span> <span id="s610">And little by little, repatriation began for those that wanted to go back wherever they came from.</span> <span id="s611">About a month-and-a-half after I was freed, a truck came and they took us to a hospital, where we were examined properly.</span> <span id="s612">And to my amazement, the English physician, a young Army medical man, said, “You’re okay.”</span> <span id="s613">I understood English.</span> <span id="s614">I had English in school.</span> <span id="s615">And then he said, You’re okay, baby.</span> <span id="s616">Heart okay, lungs okay.</span> <span id="s617">You’re okay.”</span> <span id="s618">I was very thin, but obviously my vital organs were not affected.</span> <span id="s619">For several months the left leg suddenly would buckle under me, and I’d fall, but I did not complain about my leg, because there were worse cases.</span> <span id="s620">I never bothered mentioning it to the English doctor, because I was better off than some, and I began to walk a little better.</span> <span id="s621">Some years later I began to have problems with my back and left leg, and it began, I think, in Belsen camp, where I lay in a very damp place.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Where was this camp that you went to after Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: This was also Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s624">It was a displaced persons camp which was run by the British, and there were army personnel as well as Jewish relief.</span> <span id="s625">They are like the Joint Distribution Committee in this country, social workers, welfare workers, doctors.</span> <span id="s626">The camp was administered by the military government, and the people in charge of the Jewish people were the British Relief -- social workers.</span> <span id="s627">They were very kind, and little by little, some normalcy was restored.</span> <span id="s628">We began to look for one another, for missing relatives, tried to make contact with relatives abroad.</span> <span id="s629">Illegal aliyah began from Germany into Italy and then to Palestine.</span> <span id="s630">Many people were still in hospitals.</span> <span id="s631">Some took months to recover.</span> <span id="s632">In the meantime, here and there, a brother or sister or a cousin, occasionally a parent and child, very, very rarely there would be some survivors finding one another, or friends.</span> <span id="s633">Young people began to date.</span> <span id="s634">People began to marry.</span> <span id="s635">And people began, little by little, to start to make plans to leave Germany,</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Did you meet your husband in…</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: In Germany, but not in Belsen.</span> <span id="s638">I left Belsen.</span> <span id="s639">The memories were dreadful.</span> <span id="s640">I had relatives in this country, although I planned to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s641">I was brought up to believe that this is where we belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: And you had relatives here?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I had an uncle here.</span> <span id="s644">And my mother’s death -- as she lay dying, she willed me to live -- she said, “I’m dying.</span> <span id="s645">You’re young.</span> <span id="s646">You live and go back to Uncle Leo in the U.S.” I had established contact with him already in June of 1945.</span> <span id="s647">By fall of 1945, I had an affidavit, sent to Bergen-\Belsen, but there was no immigration from the British zone, and immigration for the United States did not begin till later, in 1946, because the immigration quota was still the pre-war zone, which was very small.</span> <span id="s648">It took a special act of Congress to change it.</span> <span id="s649">In the meantime I had left Belsen.</span> <span id="s650">I had worked for a time doing interpreting from different languages.</span> <span id="s651">I knew German very well, I know some Yiddish, and I also know enough English to fill out applications.</span> <span id="s652">I couldn’t speak it too well -- I could make myself understood -- but I could read and write it rather well, so I got a job with the Jewish Relief immediately.</span> <span id="s653">I left Bergen-Belsen and went to Tzalheim, another very large Jewish D.P. camp near Frankfurt am Main.</span> <span id="s654">I stayed there for a while, and then I heard that there were some young people whom I knew in school who lived in the area of Munich.</span> <span id="s655">I heard that there were quite a few survivors from Poland in Bavaria, and I hoped that perhaps I’ll find someone who’ll tell me exactly what happened to my father and a boyfriend -- I had a boyfriend in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s656">I traveled by train, a broken-down train with no windows, traveled 24 hours instead of the few hours that it takes normally from Frankfurt to Munich.</span> <span id="s657">From Munich I took a train and visited all the Jewish D.P. camps.</span> <span id="s658">There were big ones near Munich, in and around the Munich area, and in Landsberg am Lech, where I ended up living for a while.</span> <span id="s659">I found several friends, and I met my husband there, but he left for the United States in September of 1946.</span> <span id="s660">I came to the United States in April of 1948, and we were married in New York in September of 1948.</span> <span id="s661">My relatives in this country, my uncle, begged and insisted that I come to the U.S. rather than to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: I can’t say that it formulated immediately.</span> <span id="s664">I’m sure it’s understandable that it took a long time for me to really understand myself, and what I have lived through, properly.</span> <span id="s665">And it didn’t come as an accident, because I wanted to know what happened to my people -- not only me, not only where I was and what I saw.</span> <span id="s666">I wanted to know why and how my people were destroyed.</span> <span id="s667">I became a student of this period.</span> <span id="s668">I started to read history, accounts of other survivors, and the accounts of the survivors, although not always very well written, are I think exceptionally valuable, because there were certain things that I found I have in common with them, certain memories, certain pains, certain reactions, which made me feel a little bit that I am not unique.</span> <span id="s669">It gave me some comfort to know that other people feel what I feel and share what I feel.</span> <span id="s670">History made me understand how it could happen, because I had difficulty understanding how the German people could have done what they did, whether willingly or not, and how the Nazis could have succeeded in what they were doing, and how they could sway a whole nation.</span> <span id="s671">It was an invaluable lesson for me in many ways.</span> <span id="s672">I also learned that what my father believed was right.</span> <span id="s673">He believed that we have to have a country of our own.</span> <span id="s674">It came to me with an absolute and final clarity that if we had an Israel, even small, they would not have been able or even willing to kill us all.</span> <span id="s675">The Nazis killed us when other methods of getting rid of us failed.</span> <span id="s676">Originally they wanted to push us out, but there were no buyers.</span> <span id="s677">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s678">It was my father and people like him who believed in the return to Eretz Yisroel.</span> <span id="s679">He worked all his life for it.</span> <span id="s680">Unfortunately he didn’t go there himself, because he always felt that, first of all, he had that job to do -- to teach other people about Eretz Yisroel.</span> <span id="s681">And my mother wasn’t very happy about going.</span> <span id="s682">She was not very well, and she was afraid of the climate and the harshness of life in Palestine.</span> <span id="s683">It was harsh, indeed, in the ‘20s and ‘30s.</span> <span id="s684">So they paid for it with their lives.</span> <span id="s685">But I understood there was no other way, that unless we have a country of our own, they’ll do it to us over and over again, that only with a strong Israel can we hope to survive.</span> <span id="s686">That doesn’t mean that all of us can and must live there, but the majority have to.</span> <span id="s687">And as long as I’m alive, I will do my share.</span> <span id="s688">If Israel fails, God forbid, I wouldn’t want to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: I can understand that.</span> <span id="s690">If you can, after your experience during the Holocaust, could you describe your general feeling about human nature, non-Jews and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Well, reading history and learning how they became Nazified, and why, helped me again to see them as human beings, because throughout the war, in the ghetto and in the concentration camps, and even after the war, I failed to look at them and see them as human beings like everybody else.</span> <span id="s692">They had instilled in me such a fear.</span> <span id="s693">What they had done to us during World War II made me fear that they were somehow outside humanity, and it was only through reading history that I began to understand how it’s possible to Nazify people, to change people to follow leaders and to follow certain ideas.</span> <span id="s694">And I realized, of course, the role that Christian anti-Semitism played in Nazism, because without Christian anti-Semitism, they could not have done what they had done in the short 12 years.</span> <span id="s695">As far as human nature, I’m sorry to say, though I have met good people -- I mentioned before, two SS women who were capable of an act of kindness -- it has not made me feel that humankind, mankind, is good.</span> <span id="s696">I think there is a potential in all of us for good and evil, and somehow or other, most people find it easier to do evil than good.</span> <span id="s697">It’s possible to sway people with clever promises and propaganda, especially in difficult times, and especially where Jews are concerned, because we’re history’s scapegoats.</span> <span id="s698">We don’t have to teach the Christians to hate Jews.</span> <span id="s699">It’s been there for centuries, sometimes more covered, sometimes a little bit more open.</span> <span id="s700">And unfortunately, in the Arab world, though they are free of Christians, anti-Semitism, what they call “Zionism” is really anti-Semitism under a different name.</span> <span id="s701">So I don’t think that human beings are very good.</span> <span id="s702">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s703">There are some good human beings, some good people, and without these good people, it would have been impossible to live.</span> <span id="s704">I wouldn’t want to live.</span> <span id="s705">These worthwhile people make it possible to live and to hope for a better world.</span> <span id="s706">And certainly it’s incumbent upon everybody to try to do their little bit.</span> <span id="s707">We’re all just small unimportant, but together we can do something.</span> <span id="s708">But to say that I believe that humanity in general is good and beautiful, no, I don’t.</span> <span id="s709">I have seen too much horror.</span> <span id="s710">I have seen people do such terrible things, and even now, so many years after the war, has killing stopped?</span> <span id="s711">Has hatred?</span> <span id="s712">Has murder?</span> <span id="s713">Have atrocities stopped?</span> <span id="s714">They haven’t.</span> <span id="s715">Have they stopped hating Jews?</span> <span id="s716">They haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: You mentioned that you had done some reading about this period, about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s718">Are there any particular books that come to mind that you could recommend?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Many.</span> <span id="s720">I would like to say that, unlike some people, in the course of my speaking to different groups on the Holocaust -- colleges and churches and so on, I go many, many places – I meet people who believe that the world is good, and people are good, and we should all love one another.</span> <span id="s721">The world is beautiful, but we human beings make it ugly.</span> <span id="s722">There is a saying in Latin, “Homo homine luposes,” “We’re like wolves unto one another.’</span> <span id="s723">But I think that we’ve got to work for the betterment of the world, in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s724">It isn’t because I believe in the goodness of man that I fight and carry on.</span> <span id="s725">It is because I feel that, in spite of everything, we have to persevere, and try, and hope for a better world.</span> <span id="s726">I have read so many books, and I’m still reading.</span> <span id="s727">I imagine I always will.</span> <span id="s728">I will just mention some of the most important ones.</span> <span id="s729">First of all, books of history, such as The Destruction of the European Jews, by Raul Hilberg, The War Against the Jews, by Lucy Davidowicz, The Final Solution, by Gerald Reitlinger, The Harvest of Hate, by Leon Poliakov, The Trial of Eichmann.</span> <span id="s730">The Judenrat, by Isiah Trunk.</span> <span id="s731">To understand the administration of the ghetto, because that’s very, very poorly understood, and it’s a very difficult subject.</span> <span id="s732">I think people who are highly knowledgeable and educated ought to tackle it; each ghetto and it’s administration differed.</span> <span id="s733">And some very fine memoirs.</span> <span id="s734">The best, I think, is Night, by Elie Wiesel, and I recommend it to all my classes.</span> <span id="s735">If I have to recommend something for the lay people, I recommend Nora Levin’s The Holocaust, which is written for the lay person.</span> <span id="s736">It’s an excellent book.</span> <span id="s737">When I talk to younger kids, it’s The Holocaust, edited by Bea Stadler, which is very good for junior and senior high school, and of course, Night.</span> <span id="s738">A very beautiful book, which gives hope, which I read from time to time when I despair -- I have personal problems, as well as memories of the Holocaust -- is a book by Dr. Victor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning.</span> <span id="s739">It’s a very profound, very moving, very beautiful book which gives hope in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s740">He came out whole, sane, and conducts a full and productive life.</span> <span id="s741">He is the director of an institute of psychoanalysis, called logotherapy, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s742">There are many, many other books which are very, very good, too, but these are the two written by survivors –Night and Man’s Search for Meaning-- which I feel are a “must” for everybody.</span> <span id="s743">I do not recommend books of fiction, because there is a danger of mixing up fact with fiction.</span> <span id="s744">I do not approve of the Holocaust movies which were shown on television; most of the time they are not very well done.</span> <span id="s745">I resent most of the plays which are based on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s746">There was a horrible play, The King of the Jews, based on the ghetto where I come from, and on a horrible book, The King of the Jews, by Epstein.</span> <span id="s747">They don’t know what they’re talking about.</span> <span id="s748">There are many other subjects that lend themselves to literature much better than the Holocaust, and I resent the fact that they’re using the Holocaust, the tragedy of the Jewish people, to gain themselves fame and money.</span> <span id="s749">It isn’t the money or the fame that I resent, I resent the distortion and the wrong things that are created, the misunderstanding that they create with these works of fiction.</span> <span id="s750">I think it’s a subject that ought to be left to historians, psychiatrists and survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Has your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yes, it has.</span> <span id="s753">I must admit that even as a child I questioned, although I was brought up to believe in God.</span> <span id="s754">I occasionally went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s755">As I said before, women really didn’t have to go frequently, but I went with my school now and then, and we did observe all the holidays at home.</span> <span id="s756">My mother believed in God very deeply.</span> <span id="s757">Whether my father believed as deeply or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s758">I do know that he didn’t wish to become a rabbi as all his ancestors did.</span> <span id="s759">There was always the oldest son would become a rabbi.</span> <span id="s760">My grandmother was the daughter of a rabbi.</span> <span id="s761">There were rabbis going back.</span> <span id="s762">He was the first one to break the cycle, and when I asked him why, he said he didn’t feel that he wanted to.</span> <span id="s763">He didn’t feel the calling.</span> <span id="s764">When the war ended in Bergen-Belsen and I witnessed, not only Auschwitz and the other camps, but the utter horror of Bergen-Belsen, the death around me, the utter desolation, the complete neglect by the Allies, the disinterest of the Christians -- not only the brutality of the Germans, but the disinterest of other Christians --and the destruction of my people, the desolation, the abandonment that I felt in Bergen-Belsen, when my head cleared, after I began to recover from typhus and the fever left me, I was wondering, where was God?</span> <span id="s765">I was taught to believe that He exists, that He is omnipotent, and where was He?</span> <span id="s766">It was very difficult for me in the years after the war to even think about it, because it was too painful, and I was trying to cope with my pain, to live with the memory and the picture of my mother lying there and dying, and myself next to her.</span> <span id="s767">And trying to imagine how my father died.</span> <span id="s768">And trying to forget, at the same time, in order to be able to live a normal life, because I certainly didn’t want to go crazy.</span> <span id="s769">This plagued me for years and years.</span> <span id="s770">I was young, and I got well physically quite soon, but I wanted to be able to cope with my pain, with my memory.</span> <span id="s771">I was desperately lonely and confused, too.</span> <span id="s772">And so I pushed the thought of religion and God as far away as I could, and I would not go to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s773">I couldn’t because I felt that it would be blasphemy.</span> <span id="s774">I felt that I would probably start screaming, and dissolve in tears.</span> <span id="s775">I was married in a Jewish religious ceremony in New York for the simple reason that my husband’s uncle, who has since died, said to us, “Kinder,’ you’re Jewish children.</span> <span id="s776">If your parents were alive, you would have had a religious ceremony.”</span> <span id="s777">So we did, and I’m glad we did.</span> <span id="s778">But I did not join a synagogue until some years later.</span> <span id="s779">When our first son was born here in St. Paul, we asked one of the rabbis to come to this hospital.</span> <span id="s780">We didn’t want a mohel, because we witnessed a tragic accident in Germany with an old-fashioned mohel, so we asked our physician to do it (the circumcision), and a Reform rabbi came.</span> <span id="s781">But somehow or other I did not feel like joining the Reform synagogue.</span> <span id="s782">My husband didn’t really care one way or another because he was brought up in a Zionist, secular home.</span> <span id="s783">They observed nothing, and he received no Jewish education, which is painful to me.</span> <span id="s784">But I did not wish to join the Reform.</span> <span id="s785">I didn’t feel that comfortable with Reform.</span> <span id="s786">Yet I didn’t want to join anything.</span> <span id="s787">Some years later, when my second son was born, we spoke to Rabbi Raskas, and he said, “You ought to belong to a synagogue.”</span> <span id="s788">He said, “I don’t care which one.</span> <span id="s789">But you’re Jews.</span> <span id="s790">You identify as Jews.</span> <span id="s791">Join a synagogue.”</span> <span id="s792">So I visited the Conservative synagogue, because he was the rabbi there, and I found that I was more comfortable there, because it reminded me of the synagogue that I attended with my school, the one that my parents belonged to, the Progressive synagogue in Lodz.</span> <span id="s793">It was between the Orthodox, which is just way too much for me, and the Reform, which is not enough, and I felt more comfortable.</span> <span id="s794">To this day, I try not to dwell on God’s role in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s795">I have kind of come to terms.</span> <span id="s796">It’s always a pain for me, because I’d like to believe that He exists and that He’s just, as I was taught, and that perhaps I’ve been blaming Him unjustly, because in the end, in the final analysis, men killed, not God.</span> <span id="s797">And that’s the best I can do.</span> <span id="s798">I attend a synagogue.</span> <span id="s799">I love the Hebrew which I learned as a child, which I had almost forgotten, which came back to me.</span> <span id="s800">I like to be with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s801">I like the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s802">I like Jewish ethics.</span> <span id="s803">I like being a Jew.</span> <span id="s804">I was born one and I’ll die one.</span> <span id="s805">But I try not to dwell on God that much, and I think it’s fortunate that in the Jewish religion, you can be whatever you want to be.</span> <span id="s806">I think that I am more a Jew culturally, and a Zionist, and I love my people.</span> <span id="s807">The religious part plays a role, too, but probably the lesser of the two.</span> <span id="s808">I’m glad that there is a way for all of us to be Jewish in whatever way we can.</span> <span id="s809">And that’s the best I can say.</span> <span id="s810">I do the best I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Have you maintained contact with other survivors, or do you belong to any survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yes, I have kept contact with other survivors all along, not only during the war, but right after the war.</span> <span id="s813">I have found -- sometimes with great difficulty, because we dispersed -- the few of us that were alive.</span> <span id="s814">I found everyone who ever meant anything to me.</span> <span id="s815">And whenever my husband and I travel, be it to Canada or to Israel, or once we were in Europe – I always look up the people whom I knew, neighbors, teachers if they are alive, some of my classmates, some of my friends.</span> <span id="s816">These people, and some of the people that I became very close with in the displaced persons camps in Germany while we were waiting to leave Germany, we meet.</span> <span id="s817">We make a special effort to see each other.</span> <span id="s818">Every two years we go to Toronto to see my husband’s only live Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s819">He went to a Polish school, and there are very few Jews left.</span> <span id="s820">We go to see them, not to see the city.</span> <span id="s821">To see them.</span> <span id="s822">We just made a trip to New York in January, to a friend’s, to a wedding, though it’s an expensive proposition.</span> <span id="s823">They are from Poland, and their daughter married.</span> <span id="s824">Wherever we go, no matter how busy we are, we look up old friends.</span> <span id="s825">I’ll explain why.</span> <span id="s826">It is not only personal fondness, which of course is very important, but I look up people who are not even that close to me, because that is all I have left of my community, of my city, of my people.</span> <span id="s827">That’s all that is left, that remnant.</span> <span id="s828">They represent to me my former self, that which my American friends don’t know.</span> <span id="s829">They only know me as I was here, as a grown-up.</span> <span id="s830">These people remember me as I was, a child.</span> <span id="s831">Some of them knew my parents.</span> <span id="s832">I am not a nobody to them, that suddenly arrived in this country as a refugee.</span> <span id="s833">I was not born a refugee.</span> <span id="s834">I was not born an orphan, and I was not born poverty-stricken.</span> <span id="s835">I was a loved child, that had a family and parents, and belonged.</span> <span id="s836">These people remember that, and that is very precious to me.</span> <span id="s837">They represent the remnant of my people, and of my culture, the culture of Polish Jews, of which I am immensely proud.</span> <span id="s838">I don’t know why some Jews in this country, and in the Twin Cities, look down on Eastern European Jews.</span> <span id="s839">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s840">It’s probably their ignorance.</span> <span id="s841">We had a great culture, and a very old one.</span> <span id="s842">And so I make an effort to see them.</span> <span id="s843">And I believe that’s our duty as survivors, not only to see one another, but to know our children, and to leave a legacy through oral testimony, through informing our children in our conversations and notes and whatever we can do, to submit it to them, because only through us does the past live, and only through us do the six million live.</span> <span id="s844">Once we’re gone, they will be completely forgotten.</span> <span id="s845">I think this is why I found a kind of purpose in life, outside of marrying and having two sons -- which is one part of my meaning in life.</span> <span id="s846">The second part is working for my people, and working to see that what was done will never be done again, with us or any minority, and that is not forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: That brings us to another point, about the work you’re doing in the community.</span> <span id="s848">Would you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I’ve been working in the Jewish community for many, many years.</span> <span id="s850">As soon as my boys were ready for school, even half-days, I began with Hadassah.</span> <span id="s851">I come from a family that was no stranger to K’lal Yisroel.</span> <span id="s852">I grew up with the feeling that we’re all brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s853">This was said in my house over and over again.</span> <span id="s854">“Am Yisroel kulanu chavarim.”</span> <span id="s855">My parents instilled in me a love for the Jewish people and for Eretz Yisroel which I will carry with me as long as I live, I am very grateful to them, because it made me feel like something in the times when the Nazis did their very best to make me a nothing, and treat me and address me as less than nothing.</span> <span id="s856">I always knew, deep within me, that I am a human being, I’m somebody, and this is thanks to my parents.</span> <span id="s857">I felt I had the opportunity, once I came to terms at least partially with the pain and the memories, and established a kind of a foothold in this country.</span> <span id="s858">At first, it was impossible to do anything.</span> <span id="s859">I was busy learning to speak the language better, getting a job, finding a decent apartment, which wasn’t easy in the late ‘40s and early ‘50s, and things were very expensive.</span> <span id="s860">My husband had great difficulty finding work, because he was a medical student.</span> <span id="s861">He wasn’t trained for anything, and he didn’t know English when he came, and he could not go back to medicine.</span> <span id="s862">We had to think of practical things, and it was a very slow struggle.</span> <span id="s863">I can’t complain.</span> <span id="s864">We always had work, because we were willing to do anything.</span> <span id="s865">We always had food, and we always had a roof over our heads.</span> <span id="s866">And when somebody among my American relatives said that we’re very poor, it surprised me, because I consider people poor when they have nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep.</span> <span id="s867">I considered myself not poor at all.</span> <span id="s868">I knew I didn’t have a great deal, but I felt I was lucky.</span> <span id="s869">I was in a free country.</span> <span id="s870">I had an opportunity to rebuild my life, and this is exactly what we did, together.</span> <span id="s871">When my husband had a decent job, and my kids were in school, and we lived in a small, but nice, home in a nice area here in Highland Park.</span> <span id="s872">I felt that it’s time for me to do something.</span> <span id="s873">I did it for me, too.</span> <span id="s874">I think mainly, I did it for me, because I don’t like to stay home all the time, and I was bored at home.</span> <span id="s875">I don’t like cards, and I don’t like golf.</span> <span id="s876">I just don’t like some of the things that other women do.</span> <span id="s877">And you can read only so much.</span> <span id="s878">Friends of mine invited me to go to a Hadassah meeting.</span> <span id="s879">I’m no stranger to Zionism, because I was brought up in a Zionist home.</span> <span id="s880">I know Hebrew.</span> <span id="s881">I went to a school where, though officially one couldn’t have a political coloring, all the teachers and the whole atmosphere of the school were Zionist.</span> <span id="s882">Many of the alumni went to Palestine, and that’s why I have quite a few friends in Israel.</span> <span id="s883">Some of them were there from the 1930s.</span> <span id="s884">They went as Halutzim.</span> <span id="s885">So I realized that this is for me.</span> <span id="s886">This is something I can do.</span> <span id="s887">And the women were very kind to me, and they helped me.</span> <span id="s888">They welcomed me.</span> <span id="s889">I quickly became Zionist chairwoman, and then membership vice president, and then other jobs.</span> <span id="s890">I became quite active in raising money for the United Jewish Fund and Council, in St. Paul.</span> <span id="s891">And then the first Soviet Jews began to arrive.</span> <span id="s892">I don’t really know Russian properly.</span> <span id="s893">I never learned it.</span> <span id="s894">But I heard it at home .</span> <span id="s895">My mother was born in Russia.</span> <span id="s896">Many of my parents’ friends were from Lithuania or Russia, and spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s897">Many of the intelligentsia in Poland were either from Lithuania or Galicia.</span> <span id="s898">A lot of Russian was spoken in my house.</span> <span id="s899">And when I was in the concentration camp with prisoners of war -- especially the one near Breslau -- there were a lot of Russian POW’s .</span> <span id="s900">There was a great similarity in the languages that they have, as well as Czech and Slovak -- Slovak roots.</span> <span id="s901">And since I am very good with languages, I can detect the root, and I can learn the language very quickly.</span> <span id="s902">I offered myself as a volunteer, remembering that the Jewish community in St. Paul was not overly organized or interested in us when we began to arrive from Germany -- outside, of course, of the Jewish Family Service.</span> <span id="s903">The community was not too involved on an individual basis.</span> <span id="s904">I felt that I should do what I can, not to repeat the error, because it hurt us very badly, that the American Jews in St. Paul were not overly interested in us.</span> <span id="s905">In fact, many of them looked down on us as “immigrants,” and “survivors,” and have-nots.</span> <span id="s906">I determined that I’ll do what I can to improve the situation.</span> <span id="s907">I began to visit.</span> <span id="s908">I’d call up.</span> <span id="s909">I’d say I was an immigrant myself, and I could speak a broken Russian, and understand it fairly well, and I speak Yiddish, so let’s just get acquainted.</span> <span id="s910">Maybe I can help you, maybe I can just inform you about things, and so on.</span> <span id="s911">And pretty soon there was a group of Jewish Women, through the Council of Jewish women, and we began to teach them, help in school, with continuing education for adults.</span> <span id="s912">The teacher was overwhelmed with work with other refugees, as well as Soviet Jews, and two of us came in every day.</span> <span id="s913">I became a co-chairperson.</span> <span id="s914">It lead me to a closer relationship with the Soviet Jews.</span> <span id="s915">Then we formed a resettlement committee, and I was one of the first members.</span> <span id="s916">Then I became very involved with the Jewish Family Service, eventually becoming not only a board member, but one of the directors.</span> <span id="s917">I was lead to it, through my interest in the Jewish community, and in the Soviet Jews in particular.</span> <span id="s918">I was approached by the Jewish Community Center sometime early in 1978, to work with the Soviet Jews here at the Jewish Community Center, to do cultural programming -- acculturation, both into the American fabric of life, and into the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s919">And this is what I have been doing ever since.</span> <span id="s920">It was my experience as an immigrant myself, facing a community that was not unfriendly, but not particularly interested, that lead me to my work with the Soviet Jews.</span> <span id="s921">And during the commemoration of the holocaust, the Yom Hashoah, I usually speak to the Soviet Jews, because to my surprise, I found out that they know only of the destruction of the European Jews in generalities.</span> <span id="s922">Then again, by reading history from the Jewish point of view, not the official Russian point of view, I realize that the Soviets kept much of the information away from the Soviet Jews and from the rest of the Russian people.</span> <span id="s923">They really don’t want the emphasis to be placed on the destruction of the Jews.</span> <span id="s924">They want to denjgrate the Jewish catastrophe and Jewish suffering, and present it as the suffering of all Russian people.</span> <span id="s925">The same is done in other countries, like Poland.</span> <span id="s926">First they tried to kill us.</span> <span id="s927">Then they tried to tell us that nobody killed us.</span> <span id="s928">And so I can tell the Soviet Jews in much greater detail what happened under the Nazis than what they have been permitted to know.</span> <span id="s929">I enjoy working with them, because I find them very warm, gregarious people, and because they are Jews, although their Judaism has been forbidden to them, and they are deeply assimilated.</span> <span id="s930">I feel the community has a job.</span> <span id="s931">We’ve done a lot, but we still have a great deal to do in order to make these people feel part of the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: I can see where that would be a very important thing to be involved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: It makes me feel that I’m doing something for myself.</span> <span id="s934">All these things that I just mentioned, I don’t do it because I’m on a kind of crusade.</span> <span id="s935">Somebody accused me once -- a crusade.</span> <span id="s936">I’m not.</span> <span id="s937">I’ve done these things totally without premeditation.</span> <span id="s938">They came from the depths of my being.</span> <span id="s939">I felt compelled to do them.</span> <span id="s940">I think my primary motivation was that I wanted to do it, because it did something for me.</span> <span id="s941">It made me feel that I am not worthless, that I’m doing, in a very small way, something that is constructive.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Yes, I would say that would be so.</span> <span id="s943">I can understand why you would want to do that,</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Because of that, it makes me feel that perhaps the fact that I have survived has some meaning, that the gift of survival which was granted so randomly -- it was pure chance that one survived -- that perhaps I have used those years, that were given to me as a gift, to a good purpose.</span></p> <p><span
