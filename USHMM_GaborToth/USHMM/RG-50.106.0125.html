id="s53">We were going – my father bought a – a horse and cart and we were going away.</span> <span id="s54">And we were coming til after the river San, and there we were very tired.</span> <span

clearly I don’t know quite sure what date it was, of course, but I think it’s the second half of September, we were again in ro – in Kraków.</span> <span id="s65">We saw all the blitzkrieg, all the poen – the Polish soldiers are very – very tougher, yes, but they had nothing.</span> <span id="s66">And in Kraków we were living.</span> <span id="s67">To Bielsko you could not go again.</span> <span id="s68">Bielsko was occupied all, we lived at once.</span> <span id="s69">At the beginning we lived in the flat of my – of my aunt.</span> <span id="s70">She lived in Kraków with her children, and afterwards some – some friends of my father, which were – who were going out o-of the way, I don’t know where, they – we could live in their flat.</span> <span id="s71">And so I – I was under the

night, of course, and it’s dark, we had to wait, [indecipherable] the morning was coming and then found us the Soviets, okay?</span> <span id="s80">And they took us together in one school, I think, or
