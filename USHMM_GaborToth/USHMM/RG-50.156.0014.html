power?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Well, number one, was 750,000 people in Lodz, a really big industrial town.</span> <span id="s45">We were persecuted by the Polacks from the day we were born.</span> <span id="s46">They used to say, in Polish, “Our streets and our houses.”</span> <span id="s47">There was not one evening when I was going home -- from 11 years up to the war -- that we didn’t have fights in the streets with the Polacks.</span> <span id="s48">When I was 17 years old I left Poland for two years.</span> <span id="s49">I was traveling around Europe trying to get to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: By yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: No, with four other boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: It was a very great experience.</span> <span id="s54">There’s a lot to say.</span> <span id="s55">Well, we were across the border in Polski Czesny, and we went into Czechoslovakia, and from there we went into Bratislava without a penny in our pockets.</span> <span id="s56">It was Friday.</span> <span id="s57">We went into the synagogue and we start praying loud and we say the “Shema,” and they asked us who we are and from where we came.</span> <span id="s58">So we told them the whole story that we are going to Palestine and we run away from Poland, because by 18 years old you had to register to the army and you couldn’t leave Poland any more.</span> <span id="s59">They took you when you were 21 years old.</span> <span id="s60">So we were going from Bratislava and synagogue people collect some money for us and they give to us.</span> <span id="s61">From there we went to Prague and in Prague we were staying by head rabbi, I think his name was Professor Liebig.</span> <span id="s62">We were staying in his house and they collect money for us and we got money for Keren Kayemeth, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: How did you find the head rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: In the synagogue, in Prague.</span> <span id="s65">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Were your parents aware that you were traveling around?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: We were eight children at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Where were you in the family -- the oldest, the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s70">My sister was older than I but as the breadwinner I had to quit school when I was 11 years old, and started working at the same place where my father worked, very hard, and every penny what I made was taken away by my father to help feed the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So when you told them that you wanted to travel or go to Israel, what was their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I was at this time unemployed because I went out from the place where my father was managing the place.</span> <span id="s73">He didn’t have the right to fire and hire -- the owner did -- and actually I was fired.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Were your parents pleased that you were attempting to go to Palestine?</span> <span id="s75">Were they supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: They didn’t have nothing to support me.</span> <span id="s77">In fact, I had family in Chanstelhoff and coming early in the morning -- because we were going with trains from one to the other without any tickets -- there is a black Madonna cloister, and they were giving free breakfast after the services.</span> <span id="s78">We walked in and the Polacks were laying a cross, and it was already some Nazis, Polish Nazis that noticed a few Jews, and then they start chasing us.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So what year was this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: That was in 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So your parents wished you well and you left home.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: The parents didn’t have too much to say in those times.</span> <span id="s83">They did have some, but in my case they didn’t have nothing to say.</span> <span id="s84">I had a stepmother and a father and seven brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s85">One mouth less to feed, it helps a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: So where did you go from Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: From Praha we went into Germany.</span> <span id="s88">I was all through Germany.</span> <span id="s89">In Munich Hitler had a speech.</span> <span id="s90">I was with my friend listening to his speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Were you aware by then what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Oh, yes, I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s93">I knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s94">I saw what’s going on.</span> <span id="s95">I was from the beginning and saw what would be the end of it, too.</span> <span id="s96">Then we went to Austria, to Italy, and in Trieste we were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: All four of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s99">They call it Schupzstazion in Germany.</span> <span id="s100">They send you from station to station, from country to country, and they turn you over at the border.</span> <span id="s101">Then we came back to Polski Czesny on the Czechoslovakian side.</span> <span id="s102">The border police took us over the regular city police and the captain of the police was screaming, “You rotten Jews, why don’t you go to Palestine?”</span> <span id="s103">We answered them, “We wanted to go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s104">Then we were sitting for seven days in jail.</span> <span id="s105">When we got out from there we went again across.</span> <span id="s106">Then we were traveling.</span> <span id="s107">We went to Paris and all over, but we couldn’t reach Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: At what point did you decide that you weren’t going to make it to Palestine?</span> <span id="s109">How far did you get in your journeys?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I was yet four days by water to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: From France?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: From Trieste.</span> <span id="s113">Then we were trying from Marseilles.</span> <span id="s114">We couldn’t get.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Was it that you couldn’t get boat tickets or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: No, we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s117">When we went to Germany they used to…is this taped?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: It’s all taped.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, in Germany we went to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s120">In Hamburg we signed up for the Legionen Etranger -- this is the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s121">They give you some money, to live for the time being, and then we run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: You just weren’t able to book passage then to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Book with what?</span> <span id="s124">Always, whatever we did over there, wherever we went, it was illegal.</span> <span id="s125">My whole document what I had was my birth certificate in my pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s127">So when you ended up say in Marseilles, what happened from then on?</span> <span id="s128">You were four young men out running around in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I was running through Europe, all through Europe.</span> <span id="s130">We were all over.</span> <span id="s131">We didn’t miss nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And when did this journey end?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: That was the end of ’34.</span> <span id="s134">I came back to Poland.</span> <span id="s135">We were in Czechoslovakia and Slovakia, you know.</span> <span id="s136">We were all through there.</span> <span id="s137">We went into Hungary, traveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: And by the time you got back into Poland, by then had things changed from when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Poland didn’t have too much to change because to me every Polack was a Jew hater.</span> <span id="s140">I never saw a good Polack.</span> <span id="s141">I was raised and born in a Polish territory where was 80% of Polacks and 20% Jews.</span> <span id="s142">We lived not far on Leyunov Street.</span> <span id="s143">That was a street about six blocks away from us, it was all military barracks, and there were nothing but Polacks around.</span> <span id="s144">In our building there were seventeen Polish families and seven Jewish families.</span> <span id="s145">But there were places in our town where there was nothing but Jews, like in Barlt.</span> <span id="s146">There was a concentration of Jews by the hundreds of thousands.</span> <span id="s147">We had 300,000 Jews in Lodz.</span> <span id="s148">In our territory it wasn’t too many Jews, and I was actually raised with Polacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s151">I was a boxer.</span> <span id="s152">I belonged to the Hachor and the Maccabi.</span> <span id="s153">In fact there is here a good friend of mine, he used to be a champ in his weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Who is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Lieberman.</span> <span id="s156">Mushka Lieberman we used to call him.</span> <span id="s157">I used to box with him together.</span> <span id="s158">And then I start boxing -- there was Ikaped, the name of the sport.</span> <span id="s159">The factory, was used to be a Jewish factory, had about 40,000 people work there, but the sport club Ikaped, there were only a few Jews in there.</span> <span id="s160">The Star brothers and I belonged there.</span> <span id="s161">And all my friends like Victor Bulchahalski, Henrich Meleskim, who came to New York, they were all members in this sport club over there.</span> <span id="s162">It was very well known.</span> <span id="s163">Karlich Kolidski lived across from my house and I was raised and born with this guy.</span> <span id="s164">We belonged to the same club.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Was this a Jewish friend or non-Jewish friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, non-Jewish, a Catholic.</span> <span id="s167">I used to go with him to the church.</span> <span id="s168">When the German army walked into Lodz, two days later this man was wearing a hachenkreutz, a swastika.</span> <span id="s169">I asked him, I said, “You?”</span> <span id="s170">He says, “Don’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s171">I found out that my grandmother was German.”</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Did you see him at all after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A; I saw him once more.</span> <span id="s174">Once when we were in the ghetto and he had a horse and buggy he came by there and he said to me, “Henry, they are killing your brothers and sisters in Chelmno with hot steam.”</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: What can you think?</span> <span id="s177">I knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So you believed him and you already knew.</span> <span id="s179">How about your other non-Jewish friends before Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Never saw them, never helped me, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: They didn’t?</span> <span id="s182">Even ones who had been your childhood friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Can you remember any specific instances of anti-Semitism, specific things that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Well, a man who had a transportation company, a Jewish man, very well known, and that was already when the Polish Nazis -- we used to call them Indecki -- they used to fight in the streets every day and he came out and was waiting for a streetcar and they killed him right on the corner and I was present.</span> <span id="s186">They were anti-Semitic and every day I saw it; every day I witnessed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: It was when you were growing up, even before there was really Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: That was not Nazism.</span> <span id="s189">That was Jew-hating, that’s all it is.</span> <span id="s190">A Polack was taught right in the church to hate Jews.</span> <span id="s191">He was taught by the priest, Father Schlinka, who is very well known, said in the pulpit, “Watch your children because Passover is coming and the Jews will need blood from your children.”</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: How old were you when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: 1914 and 1939 -- 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: How did you receive news of the actual war breaking out?</span> <span id="s195">Did you read it in the newspaper or did you just hear it on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No, we knew all the time on the radio.</span> <span id="s197">The Polish Marshal says we won’t give not even buttons from our coat, that’s how he was with the propaganda.</span> <span id="s198">We’re so big that we won’t stop before Berlin.</span> <span id="s199">Even the Polish newspapers, the paper in Lodz, “Our Polish heroes are 40 kilometers from Berlin.”</span> <span id="s200">I was volunteering to be thrown into the army, but they didn’t have ammunition, they didn’t have nothing, the Polish army.</span> <span id="s201">The Germans started firing 6 o’clock in the morning and 6:30 they were over Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: So you volunteered to fight in the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Oh sure thing, this time.</span> <span id="s204">The Jews and the Polacks started being friends when Hitler started preparing for war.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Was there just a change of feeling in the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Change of feeling.</span> <span id="s207">They were dancing in the street with the Jews and every one Jew knew what would happen and every one Jew was ready to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: It was sort of a feeling of unity, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s210">Not such a big unity but everybody knew what to expect from Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: How did your life change after the actual outbreak of war?</span> <span id="s212">What sorts of changes did you begin to see?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: When the Germans came in, the entire life changed.</span> <span id="s214">In the beginning, the first few days, it wasn’t terrible, but then they start preparing the ghetto and chasing the Jews into the ghetto and killing.</span> <span id="s215">The gornerenig, they used to call it.</span> <span id="s216">One “tsoris day” they came in, the Gestapo, and took out all the Jews and they killed every second one and with dogs they were jumping on the kids and everything.</span> <span id="s217">And then the Jews started running, everybody was running, into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did your family at any point think of trying to get out of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: My brother got out.</span> <span id="s220">My brother Shmuel Drory, who lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s221">Before the war he was a very devoted Zionist and he belonged to Hashomer Hatsair and his job was building Achsherahs in Poland.</span> <span id="s222">He is an agronomer today, with the Hazeramar.</span> <span id="s223">Chaim Levich was his best friend and they both, the whole group, came to Kaunus, and they were pulling straws, who’s supposed to go to Warsaw and build up the fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And Levich won that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Levich ‘won” that one, and my brother married his fiancée.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: What did the rest of your family do, then?</span> <span id="s227">Did they even think to try and leave or was it too late by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No, it was too late by then and they were evacuated to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s229">First they came to and from Czestochowa, they took them to Majdanek, and the whole family died, except the one brother in Israel and one here who is in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: All died during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: All were killed during the war.</span> <span id="s232">My stepmother, my sisters, one sister was married, and she with her children and her husband and the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What was the family name?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Rosenfeld, in Czestochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So can you describe to me when the Germans started getting you organized to go into the ghetto, what the procedure was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Going into the ghetto?</span> <span id="s237">Thousands and thousands of people were running like wild and every Volksdeutsch, every German in uniform was chasing and killing and beating up.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Was it all at once or was this over a period of days or weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: A period of days.</span> <span id="s240">Three hundred thousand people takes time to get in there.</span> <span id="s241">There was a lot of killings at this time.</span> <span id="s242">I took my furniture and I got a horse and driving out from my street -- I was married at this time and I lived not far away from Legionanstrasse.</span> <span id="s243">It was a very nice street and in the same house a rabbi, a very big rabbi, lived there too.</span> <span id="s244">Driving out, a Volksdeutsch took away all the furniture with the horses, with the buggies, with the guy who I hired.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Now by this time, this was you and your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Me and my wife.</span> <span id="s247">My first wife, not this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Ann.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: (Whispers) Later, I had a son, nine months old.</span> <span id="s252">They were thrown in a fire at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s254">Well, you and your wife, then, you moved into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s255">And you lived there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Were you working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s259">My job was to prepare the potatoes and watch the potatoes all the time.</span> <span id="s260">I was a watchman.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Was your wife working?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s263">My job was preparing.</span> <span id="s264">We had people working, digging out the ditches and putting straw and putting potatoes, and covering them up with straw, then put sand on it and keep them through the winter, that the rations should last through the whole time.</span> <span id="s265">I remember one October came in hundreds of tons of potatoes during daytime; it was warm at night and came a frost and all the potatoes got frozen and rotten.</span> <span id="s266">We digged out ditches and put lime on it.</span> <span id="s267">People were starving from hunger, and they were going over the fence and digging out those rotten potatoes and the peelings and cleaning and eating it.</span> <span id="s268">You could see hundreds of people walking in the ghetto swollen from hunger, all crawling.</span> <span id="s269">I witnessed all the evacuations, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Yes, we’ll get to that in just a minute.</span> <span id="s271">I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s272">Did you observe any Jewish holidays during that time?</span> <span id="s273">Can you describe in the Lodz ghetto were there schools set up, orchestras, any other?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes, in the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s275">It was all artificial, by Chaim Rumkowski with his clique, run.</span> <span id="s276">He taught the old men that he was an emperor.</span> <span id="s277">In fact I have pictures of him right here, and I have the letter of the ghetto, I have his picture here, too.</span> <span id="s278">We had concerts in the beginning.</span> <span id="s279">We had very good musicians.</span> <span id="s280">We had intellectuals, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s281">There were some schools, but not for a long time.</span> <span id="s282">Then come the first evacuation.</span> <span id="s283">They were going to send the people to other places to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Had you heard at all about the other ghettos?</span> <span id="s285">Did you get news when you were in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s286">How did you get news?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: People.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: People coming in and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Well, let’s say that I had connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s291">So you did hear that there were other ghettos, you had heard of the Warsaw ghetto, specific ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s293">I knew a very prominent man in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s294">The name was David Gertler, who is very well known, in all the books written up.</span> <span id="s295">He was an agent of the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did you know that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">It happened that I knew him from before the war and he helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s299">He saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Can you describe it to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Well when I worked in the ghetto, I opened a little store with my present wife’s mother and we used to smuggle food.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: So it was a food store?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Well, cheese, butter, other things.</span> <span id="s304">That was right in the beginning of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s305">My wife worked in there, I, and my present wife’s mother.</span> <span id="s306">We had it together.</span> <span id="s307">That was at the corner of Melinarskaa and Zherjiska.</span> <span id="s308">Upstairs my brother-in-law lived and I lived across the street, and we opened a little store downstairs.</span> <span id="s309">We had a lot of smuggled merchandise in there, food, nothing else, and one morning when we opened up there, about 10:00, the kriminalpolizei came in, and they took me, and they took everything out from the store.</span> <span id="s310">They took me up there, and they gave me a good “lesson.”</span> <span id="s311">I got ten on one side, ten on the other side, and I could hardly move.</span> <span id="s312">My wife run to David Gertler to save me, and he got me out at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Why did he?</span> <span id="s314">He was a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: He was a friend of my relative, my present wife’s father.</span> <span id="s316">He was a very fine man before the war, you know.</span> <span id="s317">He was a fine man even during the ghetto time.</span> <span id="s318">Officially he was an agent for the Gestapo, but he did a lot of good for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Can you describe to me where you lived in the ghetto, what your place was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: One room.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Furniture?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yes, I had some -- a bed.</span> <span id="s323">You didn’t need too much.</span> <span id="s324">Two beds we had there.</span> <span id="s325">In one bed was sleeping my wife and me, and the other bed was my wife’s sister and my present wife and another sister.</span> <span id="s326">So in one room we were living and sleeping five people.</span> <span id="s327">You couldn’t even turn around.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Did you share a bathroom or kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: What bathroom?</span> <span id="s330">The bathrooms were outside.</span> <span id="s331">The kitchen was a little kitchen on the side where we were staying and that’s all.</span> <span id="s332">You didn’t have much to cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: At that time did you still have family photographs, anything special?</span> <span id="s334">Artwork?</span> <span id="s335">Candlesticks?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Candlesticks we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s337">But we did have a lot of things what we brought into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Do you have any of these things today?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: No, not even a picture.</span> <span id="s340">I’ve got pictures from Israel after the war from my family which were taken before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Can you tell me now about the deportations, when did they start?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I can’t recall exactly the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: How about the season -- winter -- summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: The first one started with the children and with the hospitals, liquidating.</span> <span id="s345">They took them out on those trucks and they took them to Chelmno.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What did they tell you they were going to be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: They are going to work.</span> <span id="s348">They are going to other towns, to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Children?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s351">I will tell you what I witnessed.</span> <span id="s352">In fact I caught the same man who was next to the chief of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s353">The chief of the Gestapo, his name was Fuchs, but this man, his name was Alfred Stromberg.</span> <span id="s354">What I witnessed with my own eyes, he killed, I will say, over a hundred people, and when I caught him I brought witnesses who testified together with me what kind of killing he was doing.</span> <span id="s355">Like I witnessed at one episode, there was a Mrs. Chomberg, a beautiful blonde woman with a daughter who was 11 years old.</span> <span id="s356">I knew her husband, Dr. Chomberg, who was a captain in the Polish army, because he was a good doctor.</span> <span id="s357">He never came back.</span> <span id="s358">So she was in the ghetto with her daughter.</span> <span id="s359">Everybody had to have a certificate of work that he’s working, otherwise they took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Starting at what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: They start with babies up to 11, 15 years.</span> <span id="s362">Whoever was walking in the street was stopped.</span> <span id="s363">It was in July.</span> <span id="s364">It was very hot and Alfred Stromberg was staying in, dirty boots, tall man, blond.</span> <span id="s365">They took Mrs. Chomberg’s daughter -- she didn’t have the certificate that she was working -- they took her on the truck to “out”, so the mother ran with this certificate of work to this Alfred Stromberg.</span> <span id="s366">The kid was crying, “Mother, help me, save me.”</span> <span id="s367">So she (the mother) ran up to him and started kissing his dirty boots.</span> <span id="s368">“Here is the certificate.</span> <span id="s369">My daughter is working, take her off the truck.”</span> <span id="s370">So he said in German, “Go away!</span> <span id="s371">I command you!”</span> <span id="s372">So she got up and said, “Go ahead and kill me.”</span> <span id="s373">So she kneeled down and he raised her blonde, beautiful hair, and he put a bullet in her brains and I was watching it.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And they took the little girl away?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: And the girl was screaming, “Mama, help me,” and I will never forget this.</span> <span id="s376">I witnessed another story on Brezhinka 30-something, where a girl, he was chasing her up on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: The same man?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: The same Gestapo man, Alfred Stromberg.</span> <span id="s379">The girl was hiding behind a chimney.</span> <span id="s380">He walked up there and put a bullet in her right there.</span> <span id="s381">He took a woman from the same house, and she was in a nightgown and she said, “Let me put on a dress.”</span> <span id="s382">He pulls out a gun and kills her.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And you were witness to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s385">He walked in Andrarovska, was a hospital.</span> <span id="s386">People were trying to get out from the hospital because they knew where they were going.</span> <span id="s387">My present wife worked in this hospital.</span> <span id="s388">She got hysterical -- she was trying, babies to keep, over the fence, to save the kids.</span> <span id="s389">He came in Chaim Rumkowski’s carriage, with the horse, with a machine gun, and start firing on the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Since you were a witness to these incidents, did you ever get a chance to testify against this man after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: After the war I was liberated on the Austrian border, Laufen.</span> <span id="s392">The camp was Liebnau, and I start working in this time for the CIC.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Well before we get into this, I want to do a little bit chronologically so we don’t get lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I want you to know what happened with the man.</span> <span id="s395">That’s what I’m coming o. Walking in the street of Laufen I walk with my brother-in-law, who lives in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s396">He looked at the man and he said, “Henry, do you remember him?</span> <span id="s397">This is Alfred Stromberg.”</span> <span id="s398">I said, “You’re kidding.”</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: You just recognized him on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Right on the street.</span> <span id="s401">So I walked up and I said, “Alfred, is it you?”</span> <span id="s402">He said, “No, that’s my brother.”</span> <span id="s403">The minute he said that, I grabbed him.</span> <span id="s404">My brother-in-law, we were strong men at this time and we took him up to the CIC, which is today’s CIA.</span> <span id="s405">And we brought a girl from a town not far away, and she testified what she saw with her own eyes, how he killed her father and her father’s brother, Melich and Osher Kohn, from Lizmanstadt ghetto, known persons.</span> <span id="s406">I testified how many he killed.</span> <span id="s407">From Nuremberg, prosecutors came down to listen to the whole testimony.</span> <span id="s408">During lunchtime, the chief of the CIA says, “Henry, you can do with him whatever you want, but don’t kill him, he has to stand trial.”</span> <span id="s409">So we give him a very good “lesson.”</span> <span id="s410">He was two months in hospital after.</span> <span id="s411">And then they sent him to Poland, the place where they committed the crime.</span> <span id="s412">He was hanging for a whole week in Lodz, in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Is that justice?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Not enough.</span> <span id="s415">Not enough.</span> <span id="s416">To me, not one German is innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: To get back now to the ghetto, can you tell me about the circumstances of your deportation?</span> <span id="s418">You say first they took the children and the people from the hospitals, and then how did they go about with the selections?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: The selections?</span> <span id="s420">One time they took out 66 -- this time when they took out the first “auselung”, when I heard about Chelmno and when he said to me, “They are killing your brothers with hot steam.”</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Did you know what he meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s423">Next few days, all the belongings that the people took with them came back to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Was there any explanation?</span> <span id="s425">Did anybody say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Who could say anything?</span> <span id="s427">The Jews were going to the fires like sheep.</span> <span id="s428">There was no resistance and if anybody was ready to resist, he’s have nobody to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: This was the Lodz ghetto now?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: That was in the Lodz ghetto, in fact Osher and Melich Kohn who were killed by Stromberg, they came and they wanted to start something because they knew what’s going on.</span> <span id="s431">We knew exactly what was going on in Warsaw, in Warsaw was fighting at this time already.</span> <span id="s432">We knew who the Gestapo man, Heller was a Jewish Gestapo man over there, we heard a lot about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So you don’t remember any specific resistance in your ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No, there was never resistance in Lodz ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Do you remember then when you were actually transported from the ghetto?</span> <span id="s436">Who you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: With my wife and my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: This was a baby son now?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s440">We went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Well, did the Germans come into your apartment one day and say you have to go?</span> <span id="s442">Did you get a letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: No letter.</span> <span id="s444">They come and they’d clean out the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Did you take anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh yes, they told you to take as much as you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: What did they do with the belongings?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Women were sitting and opening every garment, and they found diamonds, and they found dollars in there, gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: German women are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Jews in the ghetto were working there under the watch eyes of the Sonderkommando and the Gestapo, and they were opening every piece of garment and looking for valuables.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: So when your day came to be transported, you all went down to the trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: What train?</span> <span id="s453">First we went on horse and buggies and then the trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: To the train.</span> <span id="s456">We were going for 24 hours without any food.</span> <span id="s457">And it was hot.</span> <span id="s458">No toilet, nothing at all.</span> <span id="s459">Coming into Birkenau, that’s part of Auschwitz, there were a few men who knew me, who were unloading the trains.</span> <span id="s460">They were clearly the big shots and they saw my wife carrying the baby.</span> <span id="s461">They said to me, “Henry, take away the baby, give it to an old lady, because this kid is going right into the fire.”</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: How would it have helped to give it to an old lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Well the old lady went into the fire, too.</span> <span id="s464">They were selecting.</span> <span id="s465">Mengele was standing there with the big shots there and they were selecting.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: So you saw Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Do you remember who the other people were who were doing the selections there?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s470">Mengele everybody knew.</span> <span id="s471">Everybody knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: He was already notorious.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: There was in the Strasselager 11 in Auschwitz was a Palich who was practicing on the most beautiful girls from his gun.</span> <span id="s474">They were throwing her in the air and he was practicing shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: This is incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: If I could tell you everything even from the ghetto what went on -- it’s indescribable.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: What happened then during the selection?</span> <span id="s478">You lost your son then?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yes, the next day.</span> <span id="s480">It happened that from my town, people worked in this department in the gas chambers and unloading.</span> <span id="s481">So they told me that they throw my son in the fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Were you separated from your wife right when you came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yes, when we came there we were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Can you describe to me what the process was like, when you first get off the trains and you’re at Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: You get off the train, men here, women there, then the Mengele stays with the whole bunch and they select.</span> <span id="s486">The old people go one way with the children, the women go one way and the men go one way.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: So you were separated from your wife, and the men went a certain way, and before it got to be your turn, did you think they were going to let you through?</span> <span id="s488">Were you quite healthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I was healthy, very healthy.</span> <span id="s490">If you wanted to see a picture, I can show you.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: I’d love to see a

sauna.</span> <span id="s495">They cleaned you up with the razors -- one razor for 100 people -- they didn’t shave, they were scrubbing off the hair or tearing out the hair.</span> <span id="s496">Then they gave you Lysol all over you to wash you up.</span> <span id="s497">Then we went to Ziganelager.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: The gypsy camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s500">The gypsy camp two days before all the gypsies were gassed, and we went in -- I was in lager barrack 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Were some of your friends still

before the gypsies were gassed.</span> <span id="s507">Were those Polish gypsies, or from all over?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: That I can’t tell you because I don’t know what kind of gypsies they were.</span> <span id="s509">Gypsies usually are not Polish over there.</span> <span id="s510">Gypsies they are from all over, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: You were with some people who you say now are even here with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s513">In fact, here’s a man who saved my life two days before liberation.</span> <span id="s514">The bullet instead of going in my head went into the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Who’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: My brother-in-law Benno Latarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Can you describe the incident for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: That’s the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Did you hear at all from your wife at this time?</span> <span id="s520">You had been separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: We went from Auschwitz to Grossrosen.</span> <span id="s522">Going out from Auschwitz we were passing the women’s camp and I saw her

daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Okay, I see.</span> <span id="s526">So you did see her at that time.</span> <span id="s527">Now it was just the men who were being taken out of Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s528">How long were you at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: About six months it was.</span> <span id="s530">(Whispers)</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: What were you doing there during those six months -- working?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Working.</span> <span id="s533">I was beaten up quite a few times by the SS guards for not doing the right way what I should do.</span> <span id="s534">They were looking only how to kick you, beat you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: What sort of work did you do?</span> <span id="s536">Digging?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Whatever – digging, going out to commandos and working and pushing wagons with sand, building the highways and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Were you working in the camp or were you working in neighborhood towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: All around the camp I was working.</span> <span id="s540">Actually, I worked in a barrack.</span> <span id="s541">I was a little bit watching that the kapos and the stubeneldesters don’t get caught when they were cooking in there.</span> <span id="s542">I was watching outside in barrack 22.</span> <span id="s543">It happened that in the ghetto, they took one man out, and his sister’s daughter were a good friend to my wife.</span> <span id="s544">He committed something in the ghetto and they sent him out from there.</span> <span id="s545">He was a very big strong man.</span> <span id="s546">When they took him out from the ghetto he went through the potato fields, and he knew me, and he asked me if I had a cigarette.</span> <span id="s547">This time they used to give us rations every two weeks.</span> <span id="s548">I didn’t smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: This was in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s551">I had two packages of cigarettes and he was escorted by police and I run over and I gave him the two packages of cigarettes, so he asked me if I can, I help his sister and his niece.</span> <span id="s552">So in fact when they liquidate one side of the ghetto, I took them both across and…</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Across to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: On the other side of the ghetto, and there was an empty room in the same house where I lived, same building.</span> <span id="s555">I give them the apartment right across from mw.</span> <span id="s556">They took it.</span> <span id="s557">I didn’t have to “give” it, it was empty!</span> <span id="s558">There was furniture there, they took out the people and they sent them out.</span> <span id="s559">Before I was taken away, a day before, the police took them, those two, and they asked me to help them.</span> <span id="s560">Like I mentioned before, I had connections.</span> <span id="s561">So I says I can’t help you because I’m going tomorrow.</span> <span id="s562">So when they came to Auschwitz and this same man was the kapo, and the kapo was your man, for death or life.</span> <span id="s563">He could do with you whatever he wanted.</span> <span id="s564">In fact, the day kapo killed Rumkowski, he killed the chief of police from this ghetto, the Jew Rosenblatt.</span> <span id="s565">And the night one could do whatever he wanted.</span> <span id="s566">So when I found out that he is the kapo at night, I sent somebody to let him know that I am here.</span> <span id="s567">He came out and he says, “I am going to kill you.”</span> <span id="s568">I says, ‘That’s so?</span> <span id="s569">You’re going to kill me?</span> <span id="s570">I’d like to know why.”</span> <span id="s571">He said, “You didn’t help my sister.”</span> <span id="s572">I said, ‘How could I help her, when did she come?”</span> <span id="s573">He said, “Yesterday.’</span> <span id="s574">I said, ‘How could I help her if I’m here today?’</span> <span id="s575">So next day he came into the barracks, in the gypsy lager and he brought me bread, he brought me cigarettes -- he gave me back 100 cigarettes for the packages.</span> <span id="s576">And he said, “You’re not going out to work, you will work right here.”</span> <span id="s577">Because he had to say whatever happened, he was a big man over there.</span> <span id="s578">“So, what would you like to do?”</span> <span id="s579">I said, “I wouldn’t like to do nothing.</span> <span id="s580">I don’t want to be anything.’</span> <span id="s581">He said, “You have to do something.</span> <span id="s582">I’ll tell you what; I’ll talk to the stubeneldester this time, and you will watch in the front of the barrack.</span> <span id="s583">If an SS guard walks by, let them know, the kapos.”</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Was that considered an easy job?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s586">It was a horse barn where 1,600 people at night were sitting one into another, squeezed.</span> <span id="s587">It’s indescribable.</span> <span id="s588">The kapos were running over their heads and beating up and if you had to go out, you couldn’t reach a toilet, you had to go through human hell.</span> <span id="s589">At 3:30 in the morning they chased you out, the kapos, with sticks, beating, and outside it was drizzling.</span> <span id="s590">It was indescribable.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Can you describe for me a typical day – what time you woke up, what sort of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Like I said, at 3;30 they chase you out.</span> <span id="s593">some of them went to the washroom.</span> <span id="s594">Some of them -- a lot of them -- commit suicide, went to the wires, you know.</span> <span id="s595">That’s what you could see.</span> <span id="s596">In back of the barrack were the electric wires.</span> <span id="s597">It’s very hard to describe a day.</span> <span id="s598">They were staying a bunch of Hungarian Jews and it was drizzling and they were praying to God, and one SS guard walked by, and he took the whole bunch to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did you do any praying to God during those times?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: No.</span> <span id="s601">I was swearing.</span> <span id="s602">How can you believe in those times when they take away your most precious thing of your life, when you know that your whole family perished in Majdanek?</span> <span id="s603">My brother who is here, he is the only one who run away from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: So that’s how you know what happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s606">I got this job staying watching and I don’t know like from under the ground came an SS guard.</span> <span id="s607">And I didn’t have enough time to let know this.</span> <span id="s608">But nothing happened and one of the kapos came out and he hit me over the head.</span> <span id="s609">So I don’t want this job either.</span> <span id="s610">So next day the same man comes in, the kapo from the night Zonne, and he wants to know who hit me and if I would tell him he would kill him.</span> <span id="s611">But I didn’t tell him.</span> <span id="s612">I said, “I don’t want to stay in the front here.”</span> <span id="s613">He said, “Well, I’ll put you in the back.”</span> <span id="s614">And in the back you have to watch that nobody runs to the wires.</span> <span id="s615">You have to stop the people who run to the wires before you touch the wire and you’re dead.</span> <span id="s616">So I’m staying there and going up and down all day watching there, you know, so nobody from my barrack.</span> <span id="s617">But from another barrack, a guy run over and two SS guards came up and said, “Didn’t you see this guy?”</span> <span id="s618">And I said, “No, I did not.”</span> <span id="s619">So I got a swollen head from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Did you actually prevent anybody from throwing themselves on the wires?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A; A few.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: How do you do it?</span> <span id="s624">They want to throw down, you stop them.</span> <span id="s625">I was stronger than most of them because most of those are people without lot to live, undernourished.</span> <span id="s626">When I said before I worked by the potatoes, and if you worked by the potatoes you ate a little bit too.</span> <span id="s627">Not too okay, because it doesn’t give you too much, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Then you worked in Auschwitz for how long did you say, six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No, not six months, a few months.</span> <span id="s630">Then there was a transport to Grossrosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Do you know how many people that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: They took about, I think, 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s633">A funny thing, when we were staying and waiting for the trains, I didn’t see the trains because they took us in front of the women’s camp, where you walk out.</span> <span id="s634">On this side, were the women’s and the gypsies, and on this side were the crematoriums, and we are staying there, and we didn’t know that we are going to work, and I take a look and those chimneys start smoking, and the smell of meat, you know, of the flesh…</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Where did you think you were going then?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: To the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: So you didn’t believe that they were going to be moving you?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No, I never believed.</span> <span id="s639">I was praying to God.</span> <span id="s640">Like I say, I didn’t believe, but I was praying to God for one thing.</span> <span id="s641">God give me one hour to live after the war, sleep in a bed with a pillow under my head and have a good meal!</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: It looks like you got your wish?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I got my wish, thanks to God.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So you were transported.</span> <span id="s645">That was the last time then, that you saw your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s647">That was the last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Just to sort of find out, did you then hear about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Well, I can tell you something else about her.</span> <span id="s650">When my wife came to Auschwitz, she was breast-feeding by the baby.</span> <span id="s651">And you know, when you breast-feed a baby and then you haven’t got where to unload the milk, it hurts.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: I have a baby.</span> <span id="s653">I know.</span> <span id="s654">I nursed her myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: So in her lager, in her barrack, there was a kapo who was raised and born with my first wife in the same house, and she begged her for a towel to tie up the breast.</span> <span id="s656">She didn’t give her.</span> <span id="s657">After the war everybody want to kill her.</span> <span id="s658">I don’t know where she disappeared but she lived through and I knew it, in camp, about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: You had already heard that in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: In camp.</span> <span id="s661">Coming into Flossenburg, 2,000 men, who went to an alter commando in Neiderschlesen.</span> <span id="s662">The name of the town was Vistegiesdorf.</span> <span id="s663">There was the commandant, the SS guard, the haubsturmfuehrer, used to be a lawyer, and had a title.</span> <span id="s664">I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s665">Neiderschlesen, where they took us, in the mountains, for the camp with the wires around, he had a speech that he is our God.</span> <span id="s666">The whole work is boarded up around, and he says he will be our God, for death or life.</span> <span id="s667">Well, it’s a miracle, when we came down there we didn’t have food for about three days until we reached the place from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: This was by train now?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: By train.</span> <span id="s670">They stopped, and they were going, and they stopped.</span> <span id="s671">No food.</span> <span id="s672">When we came there we got a little bit water soup and a portion of bread, maybe three slices, and they said this is for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s673">I finished it with one bite.</span> <span id="s674">It was evening and we went to sleep on bare floors.</span> <span id="s675">It was in the morning – I didn’t have ac watch, I can’t say the time -- and I had a tremendous headache and I went out to the toilet and there stays a group of people.</span> <span id="s676">The lagerelderster, who is a Jew, was selecting men to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s677">I walked by and there was a German chef who worked for 40 years in Boiten.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: A Jew?</span> <span id="s680">A non-Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: A German, a Reichsdeutsch, with an SS uniform.</span> <span id="s682">He was the chef of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s683">His name was Franz Milotka.</span> <span id="s684">I walked by, and he called me -- “Schwartze” he called me.</span> <span id="s685">He said` “Come here, Schwartze.”</span> <span id="s686">So I walked up.</span> <span id="s687">He said, “Vos bist du.”</span> <span id="s688">Like somebody put the words in my mouth, I said, “A metzker.”</span> <span id="s689">I never was a butcher in my life, and I told him a butcher!</span> <span id="s690">But next to me was staying a real butcher who I know from Lodz.</span> <span id="s691">In fact we used to buy meat from him.</span> <span id="s692">So I says to him that he is a butcher, too.</span> <span id="s693">So he says he needs two butchers.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: And you had a new job?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: But the lageldester didn’t like, because he wanted his favorite there, his name was Schmulikl Blod, a Jew.</span> <span id="s696">So I started working in the kitchen and he took me in.</span> <span id="s697">The meat was horsemeat, hanging quarters.</span> <span id="s698">A butcher knows how to unhook and take it on his shoulder and I don’t know nothing about how to take a quarter of beef or horsemeat.</span> <span id="s699">That wasn’t for us.</span> <span id="s700">That was for the SS, this meat.</span> <span id="s701">We got the bones.</span> <span id="s702">So he told me to take a piece of meat and I take it like this around.</span> <span id="s703">So he stopped me and he said, “a Metzger?”</span> <span id="s704">So I told him the truth, no, I don’t know how to work with the meat.</span> <span id="s705">Telling him the truth, I started being “his Jew.”</span> <span id="s706">So the other butcher came in, too, and he showed me how to take off the meat from the bone.</span> <span id="s707">It wasn’t too hard.</span> <span id="s708">There were 18 men working in this kitchen.</span> <span id="s709">The bones and a little bit of meat went into the big kettles of soup.</span> <span id="s710">I was designated to cook for the SS guard.</span> <span id="s711">There were potatoes and soup, and we ground the meat.</span> <span id="s712">So I ground the meat, and I ate a little bit of the raw meat, too.</span> <span id="s713">But I was, like I say, his Jew.</span> <span id="s714">When he was frustrated, every day I was beaten up by this man, and he was 72 years old.</span> <span id="s715">(Slow emphasis)</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: And you say he took you under his arm and he still beat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s718">But like “his Jew.”</span> <span id="s719">First he beat me up, then he fed me.</span> <span id="s720">And that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: My brother was there.</span> <span id="s723">(Laughing) It’s very strange.</span> <span id="s724">He knows about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And this was now in Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: This was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: That was in Grossrosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: And you were there, then, for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s731">Until 1945 -- until the Soviet armies were five kilometers away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Now these people that you were with, were those still some people from Lodz?</span> <span id="s733">The same bunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes, the whole bunch.</span> <span id="s735">Everybody knew each other.</span> <span id="s736">So the lagereldester from this camp didn’t like it that I got in there.</span> <span id="s737">The lagereldester, Jewish, Schmiel Radig, he came in, and he said, “How did you get in?”</span> <span id="s738">I said, “You saw how I got in.</span> <span id="s739">No connections.”</span> <span id="s740">He give me with his stick a “klop” over my back.</span> <span id="s741">He told me to bend down and he give me a few.</span> <span id="s742">That’s the way he was.</span> <span id="s743">There was a krankensteuber in there, a sick room.</span> <span id="s744">We had two doctors from Lodz, Dr. Mauvreski and Dr. Jakobovich.</span> <span id="s745">Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Now by then were you quite ill, or were people still…</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: No, I was strong, I never was ill.</span> <span id="s748">Of six men who weren’t ill at all, I was one of those.</span> <span id="s749">I used to steal soups, put away and bring it in to the Krankensteuber.</span> <span id="s750">It was, after quite a few months -- I can’t tell you when -- of 2,000 were left alive only 600.</span> <span id="s751">Every morning I was hearing the war was so bad, Hitler was losing.</span> <span id="s752">It was the Soviet armies.</span> <span id="s753">When we left Auschwitz, the Soviet army was staying 40 kilometers from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: How did you know that?</span> <span id="s755">Just word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: We had communications.</span> <span id="s757">In Flossenburg there were around 8,000 people.</span> <span id="s758">From our 2,000 was left only 600.</span> <span id="s759">Every morning I was carrying with two other guys from the kitchen ersatz coffee -- artificial coffee -- into the SS guards where they were sleeping, in their rooms, past the wires.</span> <span id="s760">They let us through and next to it was a room with machine guns, with everything, and I saw what’s going on and I said to my friends in the kitchen -- we were quite a few strong men there -- I said let’s get in there, because in this time they took out all the young SS guards and put in old men -- 50, 60 -- year -- old men.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Who did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: The Gestapo, the commandant from the headquarters, from Grossrosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: And what were they doing with the young SS people?</span> <span id="s764">Sending them to fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: To fight.</span> <span id="s766">One day we had a fight, the sky was red, and they took everybody from all the camps around.</span> <span id="s767">When we walked out from our camp there were 600 men there.</span> <span id="s768">Walking in the street, with my own ears I heard one of the German women ask an SS guard, “Who are those people in the stripes?”</span> <span id="s769">The SS guard said, “They are Jews.”</span> <span id="s770">So she said, “Why don’t you kill them?”</span> <span id="s771">Then they got together from all the camps around.</span> <span id="s772">There were quite a few camps around, a few miles, and we got together, and all together there was about 8,000 people.</span> <span id="s773">We went one way…</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: They were trying to push you further into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Further deep into Germany.</span> <span id="s776">So one place we couldn’t get by, then, we went to another, and finally we got loaded on the trucks, on the trains.</span> <span id="s777">One hundred and twenty in each wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: By now, did you know that things were not going well for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: We saw the Soviet, we heard the shooting, day and night.</span> <span id="s780">(Gets very agitated) It was red.</span> <span id="s781">We saw what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Did you feel you were going to make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: No!</span> <span id="s784">We were sure we never will make it.</span> <span id="s785">Because going out from this camp, this Dr. Mauvreski was sick.</span> <span id="s786">Dr. Jakobovsky died on my hands in the train.</span> <span id="s787">Dr. Mauvreski took out an upper plate of teeth and he said to me, “Henry, I am going to die here.</span> <span id="s788">I’m not going no place.</span> <span id="s789">Take this with you, and maybe that will save your life.</span> <span id="s790">That’s platinum.”</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: How would that save your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: It did.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Well, we were in wagons on the train for nine days.</span> <span id="s795">Every day no food.</span> <span id="s796">People were dying.</span> <span id="s797">We were sitting on bodies, green bellies, falling apart.</span> <span id="s798">Every day they open it and they took out the dead bodies and were put in the one wagon and took the people and fill it up again.</span> <span id="s799">I think we went to Prague and they stopped and there was a German army train going and we were staying.</span> <span id="s800">When they opened the wagon one of the officers asked, “What’s going on?</span> <span id="s801">Who are they?</span> <span id="s802">Women were there too so one of the SS guard, he was high ranking, he said, “Don’t ask questions or we will shoot you.”</span> <span id="s803">Questions.</span> <span id="s804">Well, finally we wind up, we are from Grossrosen into Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s805">Walking into Flossenburg -- that was a German camp -- which was built by prisoners who were taken out of Waibeek and other heavy prisons, like our Sing Sing in United States.</span> <span id="s806">So this was criminals, lifers, death sentence.</span> <span id="s807">They were the Germans, the Reichsdeutschen, over there in this camp.</span> <span id="s808">When we walked into Flossenburg, first what they say, every stone would be built here.</span> <span id="s809">Was German camps that we had, now it would be Jewish camps.</span> <span id="s810">I was beaten up.</span> <span id="s811">It was one of the worst camps.</span> <span id="s812">Next morning the Gestapo, the SS guard, came in, high ranking, haupsturmfuhrers and other lieutenants like this, and they select some people, and they give them the gray gloves and we know what it means, the gray gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: What does it mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Unload bodies.</span> <span id="s815">We have 3,000 bodies from the 8,000 people who were in the wagons.</span> <span id="s816">There were 3,000 bodies, and they took me to unload.</span> <span id="s817">But Flossenburg had only one crematorium.</span> <span id="s818">When we unload the bodies they were falling apart.</span> <span id="s819">It was warm.</span> <span id="s820">The smell was indescribable.</span> <span id="s821">So we would let them down -- the crematorium was down -- but the crematorium could take only so many, so we had to dig ditches and put wood and tar and people, wood and tar and people burning.</span> <span id="s822">We were burning the people and sitting on it.</span> <span id="s823">So after we were done with this we knew that nobody came back who worked in a crematorium, but we went up there two hours and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: So when you were doing that sonder commando sort of work, you really thought that was the end for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: This is the end, for sure.</span> <span id="s826">All of this camp was so horrible.</span> <span id="s827">It was in February 1945.</span> <span id="s828">It was wet outside.</span> <span id="s829">Mud this deep, to the knee.</span> <span id="s830">3:30 in the morning the Stubeneldester came in half drunk, with a bunch of musicians and chased us all outside.</span> <span id="s831">In the meantime, the guards around threw the light and they started firing.</span> <span id="s832">There was no walk over there.</span> <span id="s833">We were staying in the mud, so deep.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: And they were shooting at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Were people running?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: People were running, and they were shooting.</span> <span id="s838">People were staying, they weren’t shooting.</span> <span id="s839">But how can you stay in the mud?</span> <span id="s840">It was cold, it was drizzling.</span> <span id="s841">People were dying like flies.</span> <span id="s842">They put a number on their chest, their registration number.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: How did they put it on?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: We write it with a red marker.</span> <span id="s845">We took the bodies into the toilet.</span> <span id="s846">I saw what’s going on, that we won’t get through here and I have in my pocket this piece of platinum.</span> <span id="s847">So I walk up to the Stubeneldester.</span> <span id="s848">He had a separate room.</span> <span id="s849">Every one of them had separate rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Back up a little bit to the writing on.</span> <span id="s851">Explain that to me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Well, somebody would drop dead, because most of them were nothing but skin and bones.</span> <span id="s853">So when they fell dead or he was half dead, they took them, they write their number on the chest.</span> <span id="s854">Then this number is gone, and they took them out.</span> <span id="s855">they piled them up in the toilet, and then they let them down the chute to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: So you really thought they were just going to let you all stand there until, who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s858">So finally, in the evening, I walk up to this door where a kapo stays, and he asks me in German, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s859">“I have to talk with the Stubeneldester.</span> <span id="s860">I have something for him.”</span> <span id="s861">So he said to me, “You can’t talk with him.</span> <span id="s862">You have to tell me.”</span> <span id="s863">I said, “Even if you kill me, I have to talk with him.”</span> <span id="s864">In the meantime the stubeneldester opened the door and he said in German to me, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s865">So I took out this upper platinum teeth and I said to him, “I won’t come out from here.</span> <span id="s866">And this is worth a lot of money.</span> <span id="s867">Take it.”</span> <span id="s868">He said he can’t give me enough.</span> <span id="s869">I said, “Take it.”</span> <span id="s870">I said I don’t want nothing.</span> <span id="s871">I want to be in barrack and I will do whatever you tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: So it was the metal itself that was worth the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s874">Platinum is worth a lot of money.</span> <span id="s875">So I said to him that I won’t get out from here but you will and this is worth a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Now this man you were talking to was…</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: A German criminal who was taken out of Waibeek.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: You had picked him because he was the one who was in charge there.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: He was in charge of the whole barrack.</span> <span id="s880">There were about 700 people were in there.</span> <span id="s881">We were sitting four on a bunk.</span> <span id="s882">There were bunks two stories up.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: So he asked you what you wanted in exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: And I said I wanted one thing, that you don’t chase me out at 3:00 on the morning.</span> <span id="s885">So he said, “Well you have to do something, you have to work.</span> <span id="s886">I tell you -- I’ll let you wash the dishes.”</span> <span id="s887">We used to get a soup a day, and in cold water you washed the dishes.</span> <span id="s888">We were washing 600 dishes, so I say to him there was my good friend -- he wasn’t my brother-in-law at this time -- I says I would like him to work, too.</span> <span id="s889">So we were both staying.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: So it did save your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yes, it did save my life.</span> <span id="s892">And finally, after being there a few days we saw a commando going out to work.</span> <span id="s893">They were selecting people to work, so I and my brother-in-law were running to the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: You wanted to be in that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Out from there, out.</span> <span id="s896">Nobody wants to stay in there, a main camp.</span> <span id="s897">That’s another interesting story, because staying there…my brother-in-law before the war, his father was dealing with wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Your brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: My present brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s900">At this time I didn’t even know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: And what is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Benno Latarus.</span> <span id="s903">He is very well known.</span> <span id="s904">You know him and Sylvia and his daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s906">I just wanted for the record to know who he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: So like I say, his father used to deal with wood.</span> <span id="s908">So we are staying there to be selected to get out from there.</span> <span id="s909">There walks up an SS man and looked at Ben and he said, “Ben, you remember me?”</span> <span id="s910">So he looked at him and he said “Yes.”</span> <span id="s911">He used to come to their house and his father used to do business with his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: And this was a non-Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: He was a Gestapo, a high ranking SS guard.</span> <span id="s914">So he said to him, “You are going out from here and we’ll give you a good job.”</span> <span id="s915">So he showed me and said without me he’s not going because we were all the time together with stories, with bread, with other things, with sugar.</span> <span id="s916">So we got a job.</span> <span id="s917">We got the job to work when transports come in and they go to the baths and they take away all their clothes to look through the clothes and look for the money and look for valuable things.</span> <span id="s918">That’s the job, in the sauna they call it.</span> <span id="s919">Coming down there the kapo of this department saw two Jews, he start, “Verfluchte Juden,” that means, “Rotten Jews, how did you get down here?”</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Was that considered an easy job?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s922">That was a prominent job.</span> <span id="s923">Everybody was dancing around you.</span> <span id="s924">For why?</span> <span id="s925">Because when you come back to your barrack, your barn, the Stubeneldester needs socks and he needs handkerchiefs and one needs a pair of pants and you bring those things to them, because you have the -- you are in it, you know They give you orders and they feed you for it, too.</span> <span id="s926">So we worked there for a few days and the kapo finds out who put us down there -- he had to keep his mouth shut, you know, but it happened that they sent out, after a few days, this SS man who knew my brother-in-law in Berlin, I don’t know for what, and when this kapo finds out, we got it from him.</span> <span id="s927">(Laughs) He chased us out with sticks.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: So that was the end of your working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Next day there is another group going out, and we got with the group going out.</span> <span id="s930">From there we went to Regensburg, to the Bahnhof, and were staying right in the heart of the city.</span> <span id="s931">We were working there on Bahnhof, in the train station and they were bombing, and this time the Americans were the ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: You could see the American planes bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Every day they were bombing a two-mile stretch of the central station.</span> <span id="s934">Everything was turned upside down, and our job was to pick up the bodies.</span> <span id="s935">In fact when we were working there, the planes were coming down, they were throwing bombs, and we saw the bombs coming down and we were running the opposite way.</span> <span id="s936">They had special bunkers and they were looking with their rifles and when they saw one running they were firing at him.</span> <span id="s937">Running for life.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: How were you feeling by then?</span> <span id="s939">Did you feel that the war was almost over?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yes, the Americans were in Nuremburg and we were in Regensburg, a 100 kilometers.</span> <span id="s941">Well, one nice morning…(interruption)</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: You were talking about being able to see the planes overhead.</span> <span id="s943">You were only 100 kilometers from…</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: From Nuremburg and the American armies were already there.</span> <span id="s945">That was already after being there for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s946">So one morning we got very friendly -- there was a Polack, his name was Bishik, and the other one was Tarig, and he was a big macher, he was the cook -- he gave us a job to push every day the field kitchen.</span> <span id="s947">There was a field kitchen that you could move around and you bring it out to the station over there and give the soup.</span> <span id="s948">So two guys were pushing -- two in the back -- and two guys in the front, pulling.</span> <span id="s949">That’s what I was doing.</span> <span id="s950">I was pushing or I was pulling.</span> <span id="s951">There walked by a captain, a German from the Wehrmacht and he threw a butt of a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: On the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: No, on the street.</span> <span id="s954">So one of the guys let go the front and runs and grabs it.</span> <span id="s955">So the SS guard -- there were two SS guards with us -- takes the butt of the rifle and starts hitting the guy.</span> <span id="s956">The German from the Wehrmacht -- he was a captain -- said, “How can you do something like this on the street?”</span> <span id="s957">So he says to him, “Ask Himmler.</span> <span id="s958">Go away or I’ll shoot you.”</span> <span id="s959">Exactly that’s the way he said that.</span> <span id="s960">When the American army, that was the 7th army, were in Nuremberg -- it was 100 kilometers away from Regensburg, they took us out, and we were marching, no trains, to the Austrian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Where do you think they hoped to get you finally?</span> <span id="s962">You have no idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: There was an order that nobody should be left alive.</span> <span id="s964">That was Hitler’s order.</span> <span id="s965">That I know.</span> <span id="s966">No witnesses should be left alive, but he didn’t have enough time to kill us all.</span> <span id="s967">We walked about 600 from Regensburg and from other camps around and got together about 2,000 men.</span> <span id="s968">And we were marching and we were pushing field kitchens.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: This was now in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: 1945.</span> <span id="s971">1945, March.</span> <span id="s972">April we are marching and every day they were cutting off at night and killing.</span> <span id="s973">Every day we lost about 50, 60 men.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Were they picking people out?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: They picked two.</span> <span id="s976">I’ll tell you about picking.</span> <span id="s977">They picked me.</span> <span id="s978">I was pushing the kitchen.</span> <span id="s979">Finally during the daytime we couldn’t march anymore because the Americans were coming and bombing, so we were staying during daytime in barns.</span> <span id="s980">At night we were marching.</span> <span id="s981">I remember one of the kids got shot.</span> <span id="s982">The guard who shot him -- he was bleeding and he was begging, “Give me another bullet” -- and this guard didn’t want to give him another bullet, and when the guard was changed, the other one give him a bullet.</span> <span id="s983">I remember another thing when we were in the wagons going to Flossenburg, it was in winter time, one of the kids -- it was small opening and he pulled out -- we didn’t have any food and any water -- he pulled out his hand to reach a little bit dirty snow, and one of the guards shot his hand through.</span> <span id="s984">The kid was begging, “Give me another bullet.”</span> <span id="s985">And he didn’t want to give him the bullet.</span> <span id="s986">It’s unbelievable how cruel, how atrocious.</span> <span id="s987">One morning the chef from the kitchen picked me and another few guys, we were supposed to go to a butcher shop and to a bakery to pick up some bread.</span> <span id="s988">This was on the march.</span> <span id="s989">You have to feed the guards; us, they fed a little bit, but first they were worrying about themselves.</span> <span id="s990">In my striped uniform I had a pocket -- they’re usually on the outside, but I had inside sewn together a piece of linen -- so going into the butcher shop, I got a piece of sausage in my pocket.</span> <span id="s991">Coming back I divided the piece of sausage with my present brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: You two have been together a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: With another guy who is here.</span> <span id="s994">He’s in St. Paul.</span> <span id="s995">Everybody got a small piece.</span> <span id="s996">After I was done, one guy, and he was a German, walked up to me and said, “Give me a piece of sausage.”</span> <span id="s997">I said to him, “No, I haven’t got it anymore, how can I give it to you?”</span> <span id="s998">This Polack, who was Bishik, who was the cook, they used to call him the “Jewish father.”</span> <span id="s999">So he was sleeping in the kitchen at night and we were pushing the kitchen, my brother-in-law, I and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Two more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: No!</span> <span id="s1002">By this time they were sleeping on it and there were plenty of people pushing.</span> <span id="s1003">Haubenstock was with us in this time -- who lives here in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1004">The biggest killer, the guy who was cutting off and shooting, he came up and took me down to the end.</span> <span id="s1005">Everybody knew that if they take you to the end, it’s to death.</span> <span id="s1006">So my brother-in-law woke up and Bishik said, “They took Henry down.”</span> <span id="s1007">So he got up and run to the Haupsturmfuhrer who was right in the front and he had very good connections with him and when the Haupsturmfuhrer came running down to the end, he pushed the rifle, and the bullet went in the ground instead of into me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: My God!</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: That was April 28, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: A day you’ll always remember.</span> <span id="s1011">And after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: So after that the American armies were always behind us.</span> <span id="s1013">Some days 2,000 were left.</span> <span id="s1014">They split our group and when we came into Lebinau was left 157 people.</span> <span id="s1015">I don’t know how many were from the other group but from our group was 157.</span> <span id="s1016">From 157, six were not sick.</span> <span id="s1017">The rest of us were so sick that it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1018">Typhoid.</span> <span id="s1019">In fact Poldek, Haubenstock, was sick in bed with typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: But you were okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: I was okay, as I said.</span> <span id="s1022">My brother-in-law and a few others, we were all okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: And you just kept marching then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: No, how we got away is, there were 150 --some guys were still together, and we knew that Hitler is dead by this time.</span> <span id="s1025">It was the 30th of April.</span> <span id="s1026">The 29th I think Hitler was gone, he committed suicide, we knew about it, and the SS guard, already they didn’t know where they were going.</span> <span id="s1027">They heard that the Americans are right behind them, that they are here, so they run away.</span> <span id="s1028">We were in the barn.</span> <span id="s1029">So our group started running away, too, and we were hidden for two days.</span> <span id="s1030">We hid, a few guys, and the rest went into Lebinau.</span> <span id="s1031">The guards left them in Lebinau.</span> <span id="s1032">We were hidden over there.</span> <span id="s1033">Would you believe that some of the SS came back and looked for us?</span> <span id="s1034">When I was liberated, when I saw the first tank, the first American tank…</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: You were in your barn now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Out already, when I saw the tank, I jumped on the tank and there were tears and dancing and singing and hugging and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: These were American soldiers now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1039">I took some revenge too, on Germans, right after.</span> <span id="s1040">Walking by a farm a few days later I see a man and with my brother-in-law we went in there to him for milk and he’s sitting in the sun.</span> <span id="s1041">And he was one of the biggest killers from the SS guard.</span> <span id="s1042">So we took him, we took seven other SS guards, from our guard, we caught them, and so we took them down to Lebinau.</span> <span id="s1043">Those 150 kids who were sick went out from their beds, as sick as they were.</span> <span id="s1044">They were tearing pieces from them, and they buried them right behind there.</span> <span id="s1045">After we all of us left, they digged them out and they put them in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1046">But they killed them right there and they buried them there and every day they went out, eliminating on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So now you are liberated and can you briefly tell me what you did now after the war?</span> <span id="s1048">Here you were out, in Germany somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: I was in Laufen.</span> <span id="s1050">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s1051">I walked in a house where…</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Were you still with your brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1054">I and my brother-in-law and two Polacks, Bishik and Talek, we took over a house from a German Nazi who didn’t come back from the war, but his wife and daughter were there.</span> <span id="s1055">They had a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1056">They had a collection of items and china that was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1057">And we were three Polacks there and two Jews and today was my day to clean the house and wash the dishes, so we throw them through the window -- Meissen -- the most expensive dishes in the world.</span> <span id="s1058">There was a collection of stems Waterford -- we throw it out.</span> <span id="s1059">There was staying a train with German marks.</span> <span id="s1060">We burned it and we found out that with 12,000 marks we can buy a carat of diamonds.</span> <span id="s1061">There were millions over there.</span> <span id="s1062">We did a lot of destruction after.</span> <span id="s1063">We carved Mercedeses, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Then I started working for the American government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: I’ll show you what.</span> <span id="s1068">This is an original document from the American army.</span> <span id="s1069">When they went into Flossenburg, they found a file with about 30,000 names and here’s my name.</span> <span id="s1070">This is in Polish.</span> <span id="s1071">Frager, Heinrich, instead of Henry.</span> <span id="s1072">This is Polish, you know.</span> <span id="s1073">Nationality: Polish.</span> <span id="s1074">Birth: July 22, 1914.</span> <span id="s1075">Place of birth: not given.</span> <span id="s1076">Name: Frager, in German, Heinrich.</span> <span id="s1077">Date of Birth: You have here.</span> <span id="s1078">Wife: Verhafte.</span> <span id="s1079">He has entered the concentration camp Flossenburg under A.D. 8/29/43.</span> <span id="s1080">My number in Grossrosen was 18091.</span> <span id="s1081">You can see it here.</span> <span id="s1082">And why I was incarcerated -- the reason for incarceration -- Jew.</span> <span id="s1083">That’s in this original document.</span> <span id="s1084">This is one of them.</span> <span id="s1085">And here’s this leader from the Lizmanstadt ghetto -- the Jewish leader Chaim Rumkowski -- and this is the Gauleiter of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1086">Here you have in the ghetto, the Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: You know the Anti-Defamation League would love to have copies of these photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Why not.</span> <span id="s1089">I have a lot of copies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Would that be wonderful.</span> <span id="s1091">Oh look at this1</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: This is in Kudno where they were hanged in the street.</span> <span id="s1093">This is not by the SS, this by the Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: What we’ll do is when we’re done with the interview, Mr. Freier, we can go through some of this and maybe make arrangements for us to get copies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: I wanted to show you this is what we built, a monument in our town when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1096">“In memory for the American military liberation from the survivors in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1097">Eternal thanks.”</span> <span id="s1098">With the cross and the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: You were telling me what you were doing for the Americans after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1101">Let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1102">First we opened the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s1103">We took the SS guards to dig out all the bodies and bring together.</span> <span id="s1104">We made a big cemetery, Trauenstein.</span> <span id="s1105">Here you see Jewish Committee, Laufen, Upper Bavaria.</span> <span id="s1106">I was president, you see.</span> <span id="s1107">Here’s my signature.</span> <span id="s1108">And my brother, the vice president, and he’s the secretary.</span> <span id="s1109">And I was collecting money for Haganah.</span> <span id="s1110">There is some thank you notes from CIC, U.S. Zone.</span> <span id="s1111">The “governor” was a Jew, Captain Benjamin from New York.</span> <span id="s1112">He was a policeman.</span> <span id="s1113">He was a colonel.</span> <span id="s1114">Abraham Kippel, he was arrested, and I took him out the same day.</span> <span id="s1115">This is what I did.</span> <span id="s1116">An official office of the military government for the Landkreislaufen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Maybe I’ll just read the letter into the tape recorder here.</span> <span id="s1118">It says, “To whom it may concern, from the Office of Military Government for Landkreislaufen detachment H281APO403.</span> <span id="s1119">This is to state that Heinrich Freier, former concentration camp inmate, has worked for military government and CIC since May 1945.</span> <span id="s1120">He has worked in the apprehension of SS and war criminals and also in the trapping of Austrian border smugglers.”</span> <span id="s1121">And it’s signed: “Southgate Jones Jr., Major, Infantry, Director.”</span> <span id="s1122">And it’s dated February, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: He was the governor.</span> <span id="s1124">Before him was Captain Buchanan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: So now you were working for the American military government and for the Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s1126">So you stayed in Germany then after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Until 1949, any trouble the Jews had, they came to me, in our territory, because not far away was a big camp of former inmates -- Einring you know and there was Lebinau and I was running this whole thing over there, the president of the Jewish Committee, supplying with food, with everything.</span> <span id="s1128">Taking from the Germans, giving to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1129">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: That must have made you feel good.</span> <span id="s1131">And you stayed in Germany until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: In 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Then I came here to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: And did you think at all about going to Palestine after the war?</span> <span id="s1136">You had tried so hard once before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: I didn’t want any wars anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Did you know people in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I had an uncle here, Ephraim Freier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: In Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1142">Ephraim Fryer.</span> <span id="s1143">He was a rabbi, a very well educated man with three Ph. D’s.</span> <span id="s1144">He lived in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s1145">His wife was my father’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So after the war you knew then that your first wife hadn’t survived and your son as well and you came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1147">Did you write a letter or something telling them you were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s1149">We were writing all the time letters.</span> <span id="s1150">I could come right away if I want to I could be the first one to come here.</span> <span id="s1151">She wrote me a letter that she would replace my mother and father.</span> <span id="s1152">But it didn’t happen like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: How did you meet or get back together with your present wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Well (sigh) that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: It must be a good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: After the war, it was a few weeks -- I don’t remember exactly, maybe it’s a few months -- it was still 1945, in summer.</span> <span id="s1157">I had a boil under my arm.</span> <span id="s1158">I was laying in the hospital in Laufen and they operate on me and I woke up and here stands my wife’s sister by my bed and I thought it was a mirage, so help me God, and I says, “Esther, that’s you?”</span> <span id="s1159">She says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1160">So she says, “I found out in Lodz, I was in your house, in your father’s house, and I found out that you are here and your brother -- who is in Minneapolis, who lives in Golden Valley -- is in the Polish army over there in Poland.</span> <span id="s1161">He was liberated by the Soviets and he is a very intelligent boy and they took him right away and they made him a political lieutenant.”</span> <span id="s1162">And she told me that her daughter, my present wife, is in Mauthausen -- that’s another concentration camp -- and the Soviets are supposed to take over this territory over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: That was one of the camps that was liberated later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Yes, and we got her out from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: How did you get her out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Well, I had connections.</span> <span id="s1167">You had to pay for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: The Americans helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1170">Her sister went down there and they both came back.</span> <span id="s1171">So I married her and Berek, my brother-in-law, married her sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Fascinating story.</span> <span id="s1173">And then you came to Minneapolis here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: They have six grandchildren now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: They do?</span> <span id="s1176">And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: I have two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Two.</span> <span id="s1180">Sarah and Danny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Are you members of a synagogue here in town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Temple Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Are there any other Jewish groups that you belong to in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: The Center.</span> <span id="s1187">Any group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Do you see survivors -- other survivors among your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Can you tell me briefly about how you felt going back to Israel for the reunion a couple of summers ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: You read it in the paper.</span> <span id="s1192">It wasn’t for us.</span> <span id="s1193">It was good for you, and for Americans, and for the youth.</span> <span id="s1194">I am very hard.</span> <span id="s1195">I can take any punishment, everything.</span> <span id="s1196">But actually, what it was, it’s coming back and back all the time.</span> <span id="s1197">I didn’t tell you half what I went through.</span> <span id="s1198">I didn’t tell you nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Why did you not tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Because how can you tell everything at once?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Then we’ll have to have another session and tell me all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: There is so much to say.</span> <span id="s1203">There is so much when it comes back to you.</span> <span id="s1204">What you bring to the kids -- when one father was heading to the ghetto, his son died, so he kept him in the cellar for a few weeks to collect the rations of the kid’s card.</span> <span id="s1205">I was there.</span> <span id="s1206">I saw it with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1207">I smelled it!</span> <span id="s1208">How can you tell everything?</span> <span id="s1209">Something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: How do you feel about Germans today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: The same as I felt when I was in Germany in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1212">They are no good and they never will be good.</span> <span id="s1213">The best proof is the demonstration against Reagan.</span> <span id="s1214">America built them up -- the Japs and the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: How do you feel about Americans -- the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: The best in the whole world.</span> <span id="s1217">God bless America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">PAGE
