Shapiro</span></p> <p><span id="s2">June 9, 1982 Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Q: This is an interview with Manfred H. Klein, known as “Fred” Klein for the JCRC-ADL Holocaust History Project by Gary Shapiro on June 9, 1982.</span> <span id="s4">The first thing I would like to ask you is about the place where you were born and a little bit about your family background and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s5">What town were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I was born on April 6, 1918 in Posen, which was at that time Germany.</span> <span id="s7">In 1922, after opting for German statehood, we moved to Breslau, Germany</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: You say that it was Germany at the time you were born.</span> <span id="s9">Was it part of another country?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: After the Treaty of Versailles, it became Poland, because it was a province of Posen which was Germany and I was born half a year before the end of the war, so after the war, it became Poland, and that’s when we moved to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Does Posen have any other names?</span> <span id="s12">Was it called by something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: No.</span> <span id="s14">That was the shtetl, the town of Posen.</span> <span id="s15">Today it is known as Poznan, which is the Polish name for it, but it was Posen at the time when I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My dad’s name was Max Klein and my mother’s name Leah Klein.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Do you remember their Jewish or Hebrew names?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My father’s name was Moshe Meir ben Mickolil, my mother’s name was Leah bat Shmuel.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And what is your Hebrew or Jewish name?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My Hebrew name is Mikol Naphtoli ben Moshe Meir.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Were your parents also born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s24">My mother was born in Posen on February 24, 1884.</span> <span id="s25">My father was born in Kotpost, Germany on July 11, 1880.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And what about grandparents?</span> <span id="s27">How far back do you go in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My grandparents were born in Germany, my great-grandparents were born in Germany, and as far back as we know, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Do you know your grandparents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">From my father’s side, my grandparents were Michael Klein and Setilia Klein, and my mother’s side was Samuel and Armarja Shachman.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: It’s going back pretty far, but do you know their Jewish names at all if it’s different from the actual names they used every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: (Laughs) I don’t have the Jewish names.</span> <span id="s34">My grandfather’s name was Michael ben Naphtali -- from my father’s side.</span> <span id="s35">My grandmother from my father’s side was -- I don’t know quite.</span> <span id="s36">My grandfather from my mother’s side was Shmuel, but I don’t know my great grandfather’s Jewish name.</span> <span id="s37">My grandmother’s Jewish name was Marka.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My father had a business, the wholesale business, and was also a public salesman.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did your mother work outside of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And do you remember what your grandparents did?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: My grandparents from my mother’s side were in the china, crystal and glass wholesale and retail business in Berlin.</span> <span id="s44">From my father’s side -- as way back as I can remember -- they were in the milling business -- flour mills -- in Kotpos and in Pinet by Posen.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Now in your home, what languages were spoken?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Just German?</span> <span id="s48">No Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No.</span> <span id="s50">German Jews never talked Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: You didn’t have any friends, or parents of your friends, who spoke Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: No.</span> <span id="s53">You see in German Jewry, Yiddish was not a language which was spoken among German Jews.</span> <span id="s54">The German Jews were very assimilated to the surroundings -- not always as far as their religious beliefs were concerned.</span> <span id="s55">But they were assimilated as far as their habits and their language was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did you think of yourselves, or did you think of yourself as assimilated?</span> <span id="s57">Is that something that you thought about -- that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span> <span id="s59">We thought about ourselves as German citizens of the Jewish faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Your parents or yourself didn’t speak other languages like Polish or Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: My dad spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Does that mean that you have some Polish background in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No.</span> <span id="s64">Posen -- the province of Posen -- consisted of 50% German population and 50% Polish population.</span> <span id="s65">And so you had to know -- if you were a traveling salesman -- both languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: You mentioned about religious beliefs.</span> <span id="s67">Would you call your family religious when they were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: We were Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: And were you Orthodox in observance, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: We were Orthodox in observance.</span> <span id="s71">My parents were more Conservative.</span> <span id="s72">I myself was Orthodox in my youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How did you become more Orthodox than your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Through school and teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What kind of Jewish education did you have in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I had religious school, and cheder, and private studies in Talmud and Gemorrah with a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: How did religious school differ, then from cheder?</span> <span id="s78">Was that a higher level?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: The religious school was a school which was associated with synagogues mostly -- while the cheder was associated with some of the Hasidic sects of which I had some friends and I took part in special studies, but I also learned Gemorrah with my rabbis from the religious school as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Was this religious school associated with one particular synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No.</span> <span id="s82">The religious school was with a Conservative-Orthodox movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: What do you mean by Conservative-Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: The Conservative-Orthodox had one religious school and the Liberals had another one.</span> <span id="s85">We were separated with two religious schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Because when you say Conservative-Orthodox, you don’t mean like the Conservative movement is here?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: The Conservative movement in Germany was nearly as strict as the Orthodox movement in America is.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So they combined in one?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: They were combined in one.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Now, did your parents have any link with Zionism or the Zionist movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No.</span> <span id="s92">My parents did not.</span> <span id="s93">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Could you talk about that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I was, in my youth, a member of Habonim, but at the same time, I was also with Agudas Yisroel, which was an Orthodox youth movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: What kinds of activities did you do in Habonim?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: You’re going back 50 years.</span> <span id="s98">(Laughs) The Habonim was actually mostly social, and it was actually more to associate with people, with boys and girls of my age.</span> <span id="s99">In the other movement, which was a youth movement of the Agudas Yisroel, I was leader of the Agudas Yisroel.</span> <span id="s100">I was a member and I was leading youth groups there.</span> <span id="s101">I was also for a while, city-wide leader of the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: I wanted to pick up on one point that we covered a little bit more, and that was, you said that all German Jews had a feeling of being German -- of Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s103">Do you think that both the Orthodox and the Liberals felt the same on that, or were they different?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: No.</span> <span id="s105">they felt the same.</span> <span id="s106">Especially in those times.</span> <span id="s107">Today, I think, sometimes the Jewish population are feeling very strongly as Jews in a nationalistic way of thinking.</span> <span id="s108">In those days, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s109">The nationalistic thinking was that they were Germans, but they were very conscious of being Jews as a religious feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Growing up in Posen -- in Germany -- what kinds of experiences did you have when you were young with anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: In Posen I didn’t have any experience at all.</span> <span id="s112">I was four years old when I left Posen.</span> <span id="s113">(Laughs) I have a very slight recollection of Posen itself.</span> <span id="s114">My growing up was in Breslau, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: My question was meant to ask, what experiences did you have with anti-Semitism, with any experiences of feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: The anti-Semitism which we had -- there was always this, naturally, a slight anti-Semitism -- like you have it also very often here in America, of gentile people who, when something doesn’t go wrong, they don’t feel right against the Jews.</span> <span id="s117">But real anti-Semitism started in 1933 when the Hitler movement came.</span> <span id="s118">Before that, you did not feel anti-Semitism that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: So you would say that the feeling that you had of being disliked as a Jew wasn’t much different that what goes on here in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you have any fights or arguments as a boy with gentiles?</span> <span id="s122">Because of your being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: That was after 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: How old were you in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: In 1933, I was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s126">I was still in high school then.</span> <span id="s127">And I did have to fight my way in and out of school, because I refused to leave the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Do you remember -- before Hitler came to power -- either of your parents talking about anti-Semitism or pogroms that they had experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Germany didn’t have pogroms.</span> <span id="s130">That was in Russia.</span> <span id="s131">Pogroms were in Russia -- in 1877 -- when you had the Kishinev pogroms.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: I didn’t necessarily mean a full scale, but just outbreaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No.</span> <span id="s134">There were no pogroms in Germany, you see, and that’s why the German Jews felt pretty secure -- the same as the American Jew feels secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: So, in the early 30’s, when Hitler came to power, can you describe a little bit about what that was like?</span> <span id="s136">Do you remember the news events of the time?</span> <span id="s137">Do you remember his coming to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Were people afraid of him?</span> <span id="s140">When he came to power, Jews?</span> <span id="s141">Right away at the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Naturally.</span> <span id="s143">Afraid of him?</span> <span id="s144">Yes.</span> <span id="s145">The same as you are afraid of any dictator who would be coming, and anybody whose oratory was against a certain section of the population -- which was in this case the Jews.</span> <span id="s146">But we still had hope -- having lived in a democratic country for so long -- that, okay, he was voted in -- we will be able one of these days to vote him out.</span> <span id="s147">We had always hope to be able to get rid of him -- which we couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So, when he came to power, did he seem more powerful than the government that came before -- in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes, I would say definitely yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Were you aware of any things that were done by the Nazis to change the government right in the first couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">The Nuremburg Laws and the school laws.</span> <span id="s153">We were allowed to have so many percent of Jewish children in schools and things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: There were never any quotas of Jews before Hitler?</span> <span id="s155">.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No.</span> <span id="s157">There were no quotas.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: At the time -- as opposed to what you came to know later on -- like the reading after the war -- what Nuremburg Laws were you aware of, and what laws affected your lives that Hitler made -- besides the school laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Our lives were affected, but you took a lot of the things in stride, hoping there will be a change in it.</span> <span id="s160">I myself, I was still fairly young and could cope with it.</span> <span id="s161">I took it in the stride.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And what about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: My parents had the same hope as we all had -- that things would change.</span> <span id="s164">We were wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Gertrude and Maliburt.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Do you remember their Jewish names?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Maliburt was Malka bas Moshe Meir and Gertrude was Golda bas Moshe Meir.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: What ways did you find out about what was going on in the government -- through newspapers or radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Newspapers, radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Was there a lot of information passed through friends and neighbors -- word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: You were very careful after ’33 to whom you talked to.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So there was a feeling that there were people who were spying on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No.</span> <span id="s177">You did not trust anybody.</span> <span id="s178">It wasn’t so much a feeling, but you couldn’t trust.</span> <span id="s179">As a matter of fact, amongst gentile peoples, were parents who didn’t trust their own children and vice versa.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: So even among other Jews, you had a feeling of…</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Oh, amongst other Jews you did not.</span> <span id="s182">You trusted Jews.</span> <span id="s183">Jews did not sell each other out.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Was this a great percentage of your friends, or just one or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: It’s more a percentage of my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did they express any concern, or did you talk with them at all about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No.</span> <span id="s190">As I said before, you didn’t talk with anybody about anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Even friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Even friends, because you never know what could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did any gentiles make statements to you like, “Gee, I really don’t like what Hitler is doing?”</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Once in a while, maybe, odd ones.</span> <span id="s195">Of course, even amongst gentiles, it’s the same thing as here in America, again.</span> <span id="s196">Every gentile has a “good Jewish friend.”</span> <span id="s197">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Your town that you lived in after Posen -- how far was that from Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: 360 kilometers.</span> <span id="s200">Or 250 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did you have relatives outside of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A; Here in America I had relatives.</span> <span id="s205">They came over in the 19th century.</span> <span id="s206">Before World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did you have communication going with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No.</span> <span id="s209">Not direct.</span> <span id="s210">My grandparents did.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Were you aware that they expressed concern about what was going on in Germany for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Can you talk about what happened later on -- in ’35, ’36 -- as things might have gotten worse?</span> <span id="s214">Did things escalate?</span> <span id="s215">Was there more and more as time went by, or how did that go?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s217">When I graduated from high school, I couldn’t go to University anymore.</span> <span id="s218">I went into business.</span> <span id="s219">And then of course in 1938, it all went “poof.”</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: How do you mean?</span> <span id="s221">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: 1938 -- Kristallnacht -- they destroyed everything what Jews had.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How did that affect your money and your economic situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I lost my job because our family business in Berlin was destroyed.</span> <span id="s225">The business I was working for was closed up.</span> <span id="s226">I myself was in concentration camp on the 9th of November, 1938, and most of the bank accounts were closed.</span> <span id="s227">The Nazis just closed everything that Jews possessed.</span> <span id="s228">Gold and silver had to be handed over to the Nazis, all valuables, and so on.</span> <span id="s229">And then slowly they moved the Jews into certain sections after 1938, ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Now, before this, could you travel anywhere you wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Did you have problems doing things -- like you mentioned being involved in certain youth groups.</span> <span id="s233">Did you have problems with social functions?</span> <span id="s234">Could you act like you did before, as a citizen of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Under Hitler movement?</span> <span id="s236">It was getting from bad to worse.</span> <span id="s237">We had to divulge the membership of our youth groups.</span> <span id="s238">We had to let them know where our meetings are, and we started meeting, rather, in clandestine meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Who did you have to notify about the locations?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: The Gestapo!</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Can you describe how they were around?</span> <span id="s242">Were there stations set up of Gestapo -- like police stations?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: The Gestapo was in the police headquarters, up on the fourth floor.</span> <span id="s244">When you went in there, you never knew if you were getting out, because there were gates you had to go through, and you tried not to go up there.</span> <span id="s245">So when we had to go up there to report, we tried to avoid it, and just meet without letting them know.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Did you know anyone during these years who just disappeared?</span> <span id="s247">That they had some contact with the Gestapo or Nazis and they never came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: In July, 1938, was the first round-up of German Jews.</span> <span id="s249">They were so called “criminals.”</span> <span id="s250">The crimes they committed was that some of them were married to gentiles.</span> <span id="s251">Others may have had an affair with a gentile, and things like this, and they were under these pretexts, they were arrested and, of course, later on I met them in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s252">In 1938 -- October, 1938 -- Germany deported the Polish citizens across the border into Poland -- again arrested them and deported them over there .</span> <span id="s253">Then in November of 1938, after destroying the Jewish businesses and destroying synagogues and everything, they arrested us in a three-day round-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: You were one of the people arrested?</span> <span id="s255">What was your crime?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: My crime?</span> <span id="s257">Being a Jew!</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Did they give some kind of reason other than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No.</span> <span id="s260">They didn’t give any reason at all.</span> <span id="s261">They just picked me up.</span> <span id="s262">We knew the reason.</span> <span id="s263">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: So, what happened to you after this round-up?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: After being 24 hours in the headquarters of the police we were shipped under guard to Buchenwald concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Which was in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Saxony.</span> <span id="s268">It was by Weimar.</span> <span id="s269">As a matter of fact, on the grounds where Goethe used to walk.</span> <span id="s270">That’s where the concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s271">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: First of all, how did you get to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Was it an ordinary train?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: A passenger train.</span> <span id="s276">In those days they did not send us by cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Were they crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Not over-crowded.</span> <span id="s279">That was in ’38.</span> <span id="s280">The transportation was, of course, under heavy guard with loaded guns and everything.</span> <span id="s281">It was, you see, but we were in ordinary passenger railroad cars at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Did you know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: We had a very good idea -- we had known where other people have gone in July and so on and so on, so I had my reasons to know where I was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Did some of those people who were taken away in July come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Did they write letters?</span> <span id="s287">How did you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Through the grapevine.</span> <span id="s289">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: When you got to Buchenwald, how were you taken in and registered and set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: We had to run a gamut.</span> <span id="s292">We arrived in Weimar, which is about 10 miles away from Buchenwald itself.</span> <span id="s293">There we were pulled out of the cars -- and it wasn’t very gentle -- and we were loaded on trucks and then we were brought to the main gate of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Did anyone physically resist the Nazis at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: There was no possibility of resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: I don’t mean wide-spread, I mean was there one guy who was a tough guy, and tried to smack a Nazi or insulted him or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: No, not in my presence.</span> <span id="s298">Anyway, it is a futile effort, because if he did he was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Did you see anyone shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: In Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Now, you were describing the steps that you had to go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s305">We were taken by lorries, by trucks, to Buchenwald, and there we had to jump out and we had to run a gamut between two rows of SS people who stood there with sticks and things hitting at us, and trying to trip us, and things like this.</span> <span id="s306">At the time, I had my dad with me, who was 60, and watching my dad, I didn’t always see that somebody got close to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: So your father was taken too.</span> <span id="s308">Was your mother taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No.</span> <span id="s310">Not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: What about your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Neither, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So it was just you and your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Just my dad and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Why do you think they made you go through this run?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: They had fun!</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Were they cursing at you and swearing at you at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q; What were the insults that the Nazis…</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: You didn’t listen to that -- you were preoccupied in running and getting out of their way, so that you didn’t get hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Did anyone fall down and was too weak or old to get up?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: What was done to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: They were hit there on the ground.</span> <span id="s325">Nobody looked back.</span> <span id="s326">I had all my time to protect my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: How did you protect him?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Keeping him in front of me to see that he doesn’t fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: How long did this last, this run?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: This run?</span> <span id="s331">Oh, for about a hundred yards.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And then after that, what did they make you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A; We went through the gates and it was a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Was there an assignment process to barracks?</span> <span id="s335">Or how did that go?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: We had to stand in line.</span> <span id="s337">(Laughs) This I can’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s338">As a matter of fact, I can’t even remember how they registered us or anything.</span> <span id="s339">But we were, at that time, close to 10,000 men, in three days, at that section of Buchenwald, and we had five Nissen huts amongst us, and we were crowded into those five Nissen huts.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: What’s a Nissen hut?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: A Nissen hut?</span> <span id="s342">Oh, that is again, in English, an expression (laughter).</span> <span id="s343">Like a large army barracks.</span> <span id="s344">They had about five of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Can you describe what they were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Well, inside, you had these tiers where five high -- just enough room so that you could crawl, crossways, into it.</span> <span id="s347">And we were all laying, one after another, in it.</span> <span id="s348">About five feet high.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Were they clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: You tried to keep it clean yourself.</span> <span id="s351">No blankets, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: What happened to your clothing?</span> <span id="s353">When you came to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I kept my clothing on.</span> <span id="s355">That group, that bunch which I was arrested with and brought in, we were ordered within the next few days to come to the gate for being dressed into prison garb.</span> <span id="s356">I never went.</span> <span id="s357">I always let volunteers go ahead.</span> <span id="s358">I thought I wait until nobody else is there anymore, and I never actually got any.</span> <span id="s359">I was never changed into -- I kept my civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s360">And by that time, I would have had to go through with all of that, the billion dollars were paid by confiscation of our own property in Germany -- of the Jewish property -- and by the money being raised in America and other foreign countries by gentiles and Jews, and paid to the German government for the release -- and the action of putting the men into government clothing was then halted.</span> <span id="s361">Then they started to release them by various stages.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: What was this billion dollars that you’re referring to?</span> <span id="s363">Was this a ransom price?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: This was a ransom price.</span> <span id="s365">In those days, mind you, it was all done while I was in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q; So this had no connection to your being taken away to the camp.</span> <span id="s367">They didn’t say, “Give us your money or we’ll take you away.”</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No.</span> <span id="s369">Not from us.</span> <span id="s370">That was a negotiation, somehow, outside.</span> <span id="s371">We were at that time in the camp.</span> <span id="s372">We didn’t know anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: So how long were you in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: I was in the camp nine weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Do you remember the actual day that you went in -- the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s377">The 10th of November.</span> <span id="s378">The 13th of January I came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Starting in the morning, what was a typical day like in Buchenwald then?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: We did not have to work where I was.</span> <span id="s381">Not ‘til you were dressed up and you were sent into the work section, you see.</span> <span id="s382">We were in the other section -- in those five Nissen huts, and I do not know what the other section.</span> <span id="s383">But the usual day of work in Buchenwald was that they were woke up at 5:00, and had to go out to the quarries and cut stones with stick and shovel and then carry them back and build roads.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: So you’re saying that people were taken from your place and sent to a work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No.</span> <span id="s386">Right in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s387">Into another section -- in the work camp section.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So what did you do all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s390">You just had nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Did they let you go for walks?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Was there a guard at your door all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: They had kapo -- camp police -- who were prisoners -- which were gentile criminals, who were put over us, who were sometimes worse than the Nazis even were.</span> <span id="s395">And then we had, of course, SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: What was the food like in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: For seven days I didn’t have any water -- anything to drink.</span> <span id="s398">For fourteen days I didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s399">After that it was watery soup, which we got.</span> <span id="s400">Blood sausage, when we finally got it, and our rabbis told us we should eat it.</span> <span id="s401">And things like that.</span> <span id="s402">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s403">Some real meat once in a while.</span> <span id="s404">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: You went for seven days without anything to drink?</span> <span id="s406">I didn’t think that was possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s408">Lots of things are possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: There were rabbis with you in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Did people ask them questions about whether it was permitted to eat the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yes, there were enough Orthodox who didn’t want to eat it, and the rabbis told them they should.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: And what was the reason they gave -- the rabbis -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: To preserve your life, you are allowed to eat anything.</span> <span id="s415">Preserving life comes first.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: So, from the time you described, I would imagine that Chanukah fell while you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I think it did, but I never noticed it.</span> <span id="s418">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: So you didn’t notice anyone who was trying to secretly light a menorah or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: We didn’t have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: I’ve heard stories that they were able to, later on, smuggle in…</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: That was during the war, afterwards.</span> <span id="s423">That wasn’t in the first weeks when we were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Were there people who put on tefillin in the morning, where you were?</span> <span id="s425">Was anyone able to keep it?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: No.</span> <span id="s427">we didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s428">We didn’t have tefillin.</span> <span id="s429">When we were taken from the homes, we were not allowed to take anything with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: What happened if a person got sick during those nine weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: We had our own doctors in our compounds and we tried to treat our own people, because when we let people go to the infirmary they didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s432">So our own doctors treated our own people.</span> <span id="s433">One of our men had an appendix operation done during the night by candlelight with a pen knife.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Who performed the operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: A Jewish surgeon who was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s436">We had our own surgeons.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did you know anybody else in the camp when you came, beside your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s439">Our friends were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Were there non-Jews in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Not in our section.</span> <span id="s442">These 10,000 Jews was a round-up of Jews at the time when the Kristallnacht was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Is there anything else you want to tell me about life in Buchenwald in the nine weeks that you were in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Life in Buchenwald wasn’t easy, but I was young, I was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s445">And you just took things as it came.</span> <span id="s446">I was together with five friends and we just tried to make the best of a very bad situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: You described how at the beginning there was the line that people ran through and were beaten.</span> <span id="s448">Did other things like that go on?</span> <span id="s449">Other games by the Nazis to hurt Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s451">For the slightest offence you were punished.</span> <span id="s452">Sometimes you didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s453">And you were punished with what they called the “Saxengrusse” which was standing on your tiptoes with your hands behind your head, and they might have made it that you stand like this as much as two and three hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: What does “Saxengrusse” mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: It’s a “Saxony Greeting” – that is what they called it.</span> <span id="s456">That was a punishment.</span> <span id="s457">One prisoner from the other sections escaped during the time I was in Buchenwald, and they captured him.</span> <span id="s458">So the next day, the whole camp had to line up in the courtyard and we were watching them all day to erect a gallows, and that night we had to watch the execution.</span> <span id="s459">If you tried to turn your head away, you would have been beaten.</span> <span id="s460">And anything to upset things.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Were there beatings that you saw yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s463">Not so much in our compound, but we could see through the fence of the other compound of the other prisoners.</span> <span id="s464">What they did, we don’t know, but we saw that they had to bring -- it looked like a saddle mount -- they had to bring it and they had to lay over there, and then they got 50 or 75 lashes.</span> <span id="s465">After that, they had to take the thing back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Were you afraid for your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s468">I’m pretty sure I was afraid for my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Did you think there were chances of being killed there?</span> <span id="s470">Were you afraid of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Definitely there were chances of being killed!</span> <span id="s472">When you are looking at the tower with the machine guns pointed at you, you know very well you can be killed!</span> <span id="s473">Of 10,000 people, during the time -- in the nine weeks I was in the camp -- 2,000 died.</span> <span id="s474">So why couldn’t I have been one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: What was the main way that people died?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: A lot of them committed suicide.</span> <span id="s477">They couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s478">And died of heart attacks, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Did anyone die of malnutrition or starvation?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Not in my time, because there wasn’t enough time for malnutrition.</span> <span id="s481">In nine weeks you can’t die of malnutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Disease?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Sickness, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Were there any outbreaks of diseases like cholera or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: No, because we tried to keep ourselves as clean -- under the circumstances -- as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Did you know any of the names of German officers who were in that camp when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Johnny, Gerta, (sigh) and the boyfriend of Gerta -- the one who had the tattoos -- made lampshades out of them.</span> <span id="s488">And she had a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s489">Her husband was the Obersturmfuhrer.</span> <span id="s490">He was the Lagerkommandant -- her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Do you think that you would recognize them if you saw them today?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: No, not anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Can you tell me about how you left the camp?</span> <span id="s494">After the nine weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I was supposed to have a permit to go to Sweden for Hachsharah to Israel.</span> <span id="s496">This was after all the payments had been done, because they let you out of the camp in those days.</span> <span id="s497">The first batch which they let out were people over 60, and people who were soldiers of the First World War and had the Iron Cross -- First and Second Class -- they were released.</span> <span id="s498">And then when you had somehow proof that you could leave the country within a certain time, they started to release you.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: How did you get this Hachsharah permit?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: My mother got it for me, through the Habonim organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: So you left by yourself?</span> <span id="s502">And they left like a one-by-one basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A; Ah, no.</span> <span id="s504">There were always quite a few, every day, who were called out, and they were released.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: What about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: My father was released four weeks before me, because he was over 60.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: So, did you leave the camp area the same way you came, by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A; By truck to the train, and then by train to Leipzig, and in Leipzig, we were taken over by the Jewish organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What were the first things that you did when you got back to your town?</span> <span id="s510">Did you go back to Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s512">Within a week, the five friends of mine -- we were all about the same age -- we all got drunk.</span> <span id="s513">(Laughter) If you want to know, we were all around 20 years old.</span> <span id="s514">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Did you tell people about your experiences?</span> <span id="s516">Did they ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: People who were interested were those people, like my wife, who, at that time, worked for the Jewish organization in receiving the prisoners coming back, and they had heard enough.</span> <span id="s518">But on the whole, you did not talk too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: It was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you think you’d be sent back?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A; Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: People were afraid to find out -- also -- about what was going on?</span> <span id="s524">Were they afraid to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: They didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: The other Jews didn’t care?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No.</span> <span id="s528">Not the Jews.</span> <span id="s529">The Gentile people didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: What about the other Jews in the community?</span> <span id="s531">Did they already know very well what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Well, there was hardly a household who didn’t have somebody who went.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: At this stage of the game, did your treatment in Buchenwald lead you to think that the Nazis would do anything -- that they would have no stopping point?</span> <span id="s534">Or did you think that this was about the worst it could get?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: No, we knew that it would get worse.</span> <span id="s536">That there was no stopping point.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Now what did you do from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I worked.</span> <span id="s539">I tried to get out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: How did you try?</span> <span id="s541">What was the process a person went through to try to get out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Well I didn’t have a permit to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s543">That was a fake permit.</span> <span id="s544">And I finally got a permit to go to England.</span> <span id="s545">It wasn’t so hard to leave Germany in those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Before the war.</span> <span id="s548">By that time, Hitler was quite willing to let the Jews leave Germany.</span> <span id="s549">The hard thing was to enter the other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: America wouldn’t take any Jews in.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Was this a known fact in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: It was a known fact.</span> <span id="s554">America wouldn’t take anybody in unless you had an affidavit.</span> <span id="s555">Then they had a quota system.</span> <span id="s556">A person like me, who was born in Posen, although I was born as a German Jew, as a German citizen, was classified as a Polish citizen, as far as America is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Why, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Because, in 1919, at the Treaty of Versailles, Posen became Polish, so I was classified as a Pole.</span> <span id="s559">Not even knowing the language, but I was classified as far as America is concerned as a Pole.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Was it harder for a Pole to get in than a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: The Polish quota was way over subscribed.</span> <span id="s562">It took me after I came to England, five years to get my visa for America.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Was it hard to get into England?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: It was also hard, but we could get there on a Hachsharah permit.</span> <span id="s565">I did have a Hachsharah permit which I finally got in April, and I got to England that way.</span> <span id="s566">Shanghai -- you had to have $200 to show if you wanted to enter Shanghai in China.</span> <span id="s567">You may have had German money, but you didn’t have the dollars.</span> <span id="s568">And you couldn’t buy any dollars for all the money in the world.</span> <span id="s569">You couldn’t enter Palestine -- because the British government had a quota there, and wouldn’t let Jews in.</span> <span id="s570">You had Exodus and all these things.</span> <span id="s571">And the same thing.</span> <span id="s572">I had friends who went over the “green borders” -- that means over the borders, through the forest or somewhere where there was no border posts.</span> <span id="s573">When they were caught within 25 miles inside like Czechoslovakia, or in Holland, or in France, within 25 miles from the border, that country’s police handed them back to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s574">That was the resort of German Jews in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Before the war.</span> <span id="s577">Today, America takes in any number of Chinese, Hindus, Indochinese and everybody else.</span> <span id="s578">Don’t have any quotas, nothing.</span> <span id="s579">But in those days, they wouldn’t take anybody in.</span> <span id="s580">I could have saved my parents.</span> <span id="s581">But I couldn’t even get into the Virgin Islands.</span> <span id="s582">They wouldn’t even let them come into the Virgin Islands -- America wouldn’t -- unless I could assure the American government that for five years they wouldn’t be a burden to the American government.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: So your family stayed behind in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: And got killed in Auchwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Would you know the day that you went into England?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: On the 17th of July, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: So it was very close to the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Did your family want you to go, or did they want you to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: My parents forced me to go, otherwise I wouldn’t have gone.</span> <span id="s591">I wanted to try to get my parents out first.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: How long did you stay in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Twelve years.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: When you first got there, what was your contact with the Jewish community of England like?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Were they aware of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Naturally.</span> <span id="s598">They had enough people -- they had some people coming over.</span> <span id="s599">But their hands were tied too.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Again I’m going to ask -- did Jews ask you about what you went through in Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s601">Did they want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: When I came to England, after the initial registration and everything, I was trying to make a living.</span> <span id="s603">Didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s604">I had a permit for agriculture, and I had to go to work in the country, so I didn’t have that much.</span> <span id="s605">After the initial contact in London, for a couple of weeks, I didn’t have much contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: What about after you were in England?</span> <span id="s607">What about communication with your family in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Through the Red Cross over Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Were you able to write letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Notes.</span> <span id="s611">Red Cross notes.</span> <span id="s612">24 words.</span> <span id="s613">But I do want to say that I sometimes also sent some longer notes, because Sweden was a neutral country and I had a friend in Sweden who then transferred it.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: How long did you get letters and notes back from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Not too many, because pretty soon my parents and my in-law parents were re-arrested and taken first to Gersow -- which must have been a kind of concentration camp, and then in ’43 they were taken to Buchenwald, to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: How did you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: An aunt of mine who survived, who was by birth gentile, became Jewish, but still classified by the Nazis as a gentile, survived the Holocaust and she told us after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: When did you stop getting letters or hearing from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: In about ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: During the war, what kind of reports did you get about what was going on in Germany and in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Different reports -- some of the reports we found were not quite true, but different reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Were there stories of the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: How early?</span> <span id="s625">To the best of your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: I think in around ’42, ’43 we knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Now, in England, you kept trying to leave and go to the United States?</span> <span id="s628">You tried to get a visa to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: I had an affidavit for the United States, and we applied after the war to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Did going to England have a big effect -- having come from Germany -- on how you got involved in the Jewish community of England?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I did not get involved in the Jewish community of England, because I never lived in a town where there was a Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Because of your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Because of my work.</span> <span id="s634">For four years I was working on a farm.</span> <span id="s635">For three years I worked for the War Agricultural Committee and I lived in a small town where we were just three Jewish families, of which two didn’t even want to let anybody know they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s636">(Laughs) And our closest Jewish community was Coventry, 12 miles away, and Doncaster, 42 miles away, Birmingham 48 miles away.</span> <span id="s637">And when I had my son and I needed b’rit milah I had to fetch the rabbi from Leicester, which was close to 56 miles, to come and, he came with mohel and performed the b’rit milah.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: How, then, was your observance of Jewish tradition affected from the time you were in the camp to the time you lived in Germany?</span> <span id="s639">Did that change?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s641">I became an atheist.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Has that continued?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No.</span> <span id="s644">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about that?</span> <span id="s646">When did you first start having these feelings of turning away from the religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: In the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Was this happening to other friends of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Did you know people who were very devout who were turning away even?</span> <span id="s651">Hasidic families?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Can you talk a little bit about what was behind this?</span> <span id="s654">What were your thoughts -- angry at G-d at first?</span> <span id="s655">Or did you just feel, “Well, this is so bad, that…”</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yes, both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Was this part of why you didn’t make a point of living with a Jewish community in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No.</span> <span id="s659">(Laughs) There are no Jewish farmers in England.</span> <span id="s660">And I had to farm.</span> <span id="s661">This was my permit.</span> <span id="s662">I had a Hachsharah permit, see, an agricultural student permit.</span> <span id="s663">So I had to go into agriculture.</span> <span id="s664">As long as I was on the land, I was on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: If you tried to change that, they wouldn’t let you?</span> <span id="s666">You couldn’t change the type of work permit?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: No.</span> <span id="s668">Not at first, you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s669">Later on, we did.</span> <span id="s670">It was a matter of also, when we first were in England on the land, we had quite a few young Jewish people from Germany, too, over there, who were in a circumference of about 16 miles, and we were the only married couple, and all the young Jewish boys used to come to us so we had some contact with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s671">I did hold a seder for them and things like this.</span> <span id="s672">By the time I came to England, I slowly turned a little bit back, but out of this reason, I had the b’rit milah for my grandson then, too, Also, I didn’t want to go -- before we got married -- to the synagogue or anything.</span> <span id="s673">My wife felt that she wanted the synagogue, and I wouldn’t even enter the synagogue at that time.</span> <span id="s674">I was still made at this time, but then slowly I softened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: How long did that take?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Oh, a period of five, six years.</span> <span id="s677">Just a few minutes ago, when I spoke about me turning back towards the Jewish religion again, and also with the b’rit milah, when I mentioned that it was a b’rit milah of my grandson, I made an error.</span> <span id="s678">I meant it was the b’rit milah of my son.</span> <span id="s679">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: How did you get together and marry your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: My wife and me met in Germany in April of 1939, after I came from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s682">And we were engaged -- we met at the Jewish Community Center when we were all of us young people, and also older people, met there because that was the center where we tried to find ways of emigrating to other countries.</span> <span id="s683">Within a couple months, we became engaged, and then we emigrated together to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: I wanted to ask this, even though it’s going back on something we already talked about.</span> <span id="s685">Why didn’t more Jews try to leave Germany before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: The same reason that I mentioned earlier on, that we always hoped it would revert to a democratic country again.</span> <span id="s687">Germany was a nice country, at one time, to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: I’m not trying to put you on the spot or anything, but I asked you a question about whether the experience in a concentration camp showed you that there was really no stopping point for Hitler, and you said, “Yes, we felt that he could do anything.”</span> <span id="s689">How could it get better?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: That was already ’39.</span> <span id="s691">That was just when we were leaving anyhow.</span> <span id="s692">But as I mentioned before, it was not the problem of leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s693">The problem was entering the other countries.</span> <span id="s694">The other countries didn’t want Jews either.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Were there quotas for England, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: It wasn’t quotas for England, but England wasn’t that eager to take Jews in unless they would not become a burden to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: So, to go back, how did your wife get over with you in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: My wife had a nursing permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So you both went at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: We both went together.</span> <span id="s701">My permit came through a little earlier, so I waited around for hers to come through, so that we both could go together.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Which was more dangerous than you knew, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Which I did know was dangerous, but I was young and took chances.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: So when were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: In October of 1939, in England, in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Was there any thought in your mind about wanting to get to Palestine when you were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s708">I had one time intention of going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s709">As a matter of fact, I also had an intention of going to Palestine as a policeman.</span> <span id="s710">I was talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: I did not experience, but there is anti-Semitism in England the same as it is in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: So the gentiles that you loved with in the farming communities -- they treated you well?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Were you like a novelty for them?</span> <span id="s716">To have a Jew around?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s718">I have a habit never to make a secret of what I am, but I also don’t have the habit of advertising what I am.</span> <span id="s719">I take it the way it comes.</span> <span id="s720">I am proud to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s721">I never deny it, but I don’t believe in advertising it for the sake of advertising, of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s722">If it comes up in the conversation, fine.</span> <span id="s723">The gentile people in England knew we were Jewish, they knew about our holidays and everything, we kept them, and we had no problems.</span> <span id="s724">They admired us for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So the experience in the concentration camp, at first it affected your religious beliefs, but it didn’t make you want to hide being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: It didn’t make you so afraid of hatred that you wanted to deny even being a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Never would deny it.</span> <span id="s729">Never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Just to go back and kind of finish off with the religious question, when you started to come back to a belief in G-d and religion, was it as strong as before?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No, it was not as strong, but it was more for the sake of my children, and later on, of my grandchildren, than for myself, really that I did come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: You were keeping kosher before in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Did you keep in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: And have you kept since?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: What about Shabbos?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I don’t keep Shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Would you say that that is because of the Holocaust, or just because you drifted away from it over time?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: It’s probably because I drifted away.</span> <span id="s742">It’s an intertwining thing.</span> <span id="s743">Maybe the one gave the start, and I never bothered of getting back to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Would you say that you believe in G-d today?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Would you say that you’re committed to the survival of the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: What are your feelings toward the state of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I work for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Having gone through the Holocaust, does that give you a special feeling about what Israel is all about, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: It gives me more of a determination to make Israel work.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: How do you mean that?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: That I would do everything to see to it that nothing happens to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: What kind of situation do you think the Jewish people would be in now if there wasn’t an Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: That’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s756">That depends a lot on the community itself, too, of the Jewish community as well as the other communities.</span> <span id="s757">You can be just as strong if you would be an American of the Jewish faith, or if you are an Israeli citizen of the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s758">I can’t see any difference of your pride in being a Jew.</span> <span id="s759">So, for some people, the State of Israel is probably a crutch to lean onto and to give ‘em the backbone to stand up as a Jewish citizen -- as a citizen of Jewish faith --whichever my citizenship would be at that time, without having the backbone of Israel to back me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: You know that Israel was founded in large part by people who went through the Holocaust, and this is part of what influenced them in the building of the State, and in their strength in fighting for Israel.</span> <span id="s761">Do you think, having gone through the Holocaust yourself, that a lot of what Israel does is motivated or affected by the fact that there was a Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Definitely it is, because it gave them the idea that they have nothing to lose, only to gain.</span> <span id="s763">That gives them the strength to fight for survival.</span> <span id="s764">Through the Holocaust, they know if they don’t survive or win, they will be pushed into the sea.</span> <span id="s765">In 1948, if they wouldn’t have beaten the Arabs back, they would have been pushed straight into the sea, so they knew they had only one way to go.</span> <span id="s766">They had learned the lesson that if you keep quiet, it doesn’t make the tiger go away, so you have to stand up and fight.</span> <span id="s767">Our parents did not see it at the time.</span> <span id="s768">Also, when Israel did fight, they were together standing in numbers, not the way we were, spread out over half-a-million Jews in 60 million Germans.</span> <span id="s769">We had no chance of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Do you feel like you, yourself, can criticize Israel?</span> <span id="s771">Do you feel like that’s wrong?</span> <span id="s772">Or do you feel that you can say that Israel does do some things wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Israel wouldn’t be normal if they wouldn’t do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s774">Nobody is perfect.</span> <span id="s775">Why should the State of Israel be perfect?</span> <span id="s776">As Ben Gurion has once said, “We will be a state when we have our own thieves and prostitutes.</span> <span id="s777">Not ‘til then.”</span> <span id="s778">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: One last question: What lessons would you want people who did not go through the Holocaust to learn from the things that happened to the Jews of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: They should learn the lesson that things like this can happen anywhere.</span> <span id="s781">That no country is safe of any disaster of that kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span
