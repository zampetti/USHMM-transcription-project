c-community in Croatia, and in town where I was born there were only five Jewish families, so we didn’t have a Jewish [indecipherable] per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: So we were very much integrated, and to have any Jewish relationship we had to go in neighboring town where there were quite a few more Jewish families.</span> <span id="s24">So but where my father conducted the business, and where we lived, so, for all practical purposes, and to enroll me in the school, middle name was not required.</span> <span id="s25">And my family was -- by that time, where I was born there were what you would consider today Reform Jews, not very religious Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Even to the -- my grandparents come from a different background because you see the -- the Yugoslavia is really a offshot of Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span> <span id="s28">So when Yugoslavia was form as a country, was on the end of the first World War, when President Wilson told to Serbia, what do you want.</span> <span id="s29">And Serbia say, I like a little this, a little of that.</span> <span id="s30">So they form a Slavic nation which give a name to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s31">So it happened consequently that people were living all over in the part of Yugoslavia that’s called Croatia today.</span> <span id="s32">My grandfather who settled there is really of them from Hungarian make-up.</span> <span id="s33">And my grandparents spoke Hungarian at home, and parents used to speak Hungarian at home.</span> <span id="s34">So really, my background was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s35">And my dad, who was also from Hungarian background, he was actually working in neighboring town as a manager for a Jewish bigger firm, like a little wholesaler, but a bigger town than ours.</span> <span id="s36">And then become acquainted between my mother, who was run -- helping her father in the business, and my grandfather was getting big -- older, and older.</span> <span id="s37">So my grandfather saw opportunity, he’s a good looking guy, he -- he make the goo-goo eyes at my daughter, maybe I can hook up with him, and I got my right hand.</span> <span id="s38">And that’s how it happened, my hand -- my father married Mom, and the -- start managing my grandfather’s business, and that’s how our [indecipherable] took place in Croatia.</span> <span id="s39">But the background from the both sides, my mother and father, is Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s41">Now, what was this little town where you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Sv.</span> <span id="s43">Ivan Zabno.</span> <span id="s44">Saint Zabno.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q:

Zagreb?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: This is approximately north from Zagreb, 14 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Was that far at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No, it was not the ti -- all the [indecipherable] we had the train communication to Zagreb.</span> <span id="s51">We didn’t use the buses at that time, the buses become popular much later.</span> <span id="s52">But my grandfather was doing quite well, and so ma -- and my mothers, you know, my mother comes from a family of three brothers and four girls, so it was a very prolific family, and they were each one in his own way, very situ -- well situated.</span> <span id="s53">But in our town that I was born and where my family took root, only two girls stayed.</span> <span id="s54">The rest of them married and moved on.</span> <span id="s55">Only one sister left, that marry a doctor, who was a Czech, and he was Gentile.</span> <span id="s56">Matter of fact, he studied to be a priest, and she married him, and -- and my mother, who took care of the grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s58">So the -- were your grandparents living in the same town with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: My -- were living in the same town, in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: In the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: In the same house.</span> <span id="s62">But you know, as we prosper, then they build one, o -- extra house, or they had their own.</span> <span id="s63">But build -- that Mother was really caretaker for my grandparents as they were

by itself, and if you wishing to go into it, I will explain it to you what happened.</span> <span id="s67">Because one of my mother’s brothers become a [indecipherable] Jewish in Croatia [indecipherable] big buck.</span> <span id="s68">And he was really the patriarch of the family because with his money [indecipherable] the power, and he -- when my father -- see, my father was a visionary.</span> <span id="s69">He wanted to get hell out of Europe in 1936.</span> <span id="s70">And my uncle, my mother’s brother says, you know, I-I would prefer if you would take care of the folks and I’ll tell you what I’m going to do.</span> <span id="s71">When they die, I’m going to buy out all my brothers and sisters, and everything is going to be yours.</span> <span id="s72">So my father thought that’s a good deal, let’s do it now, but let’s go to America.</span> <span id="s73">But it never worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: It didn’t work out.</span></p> <p><span

-- a -- a little community that didn’t have a hospital back up.</span> <span id="s84">That ma -- all of my brothers were premature.</span> <span id="s85">Before me and after me, so they die very shortly after birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: The only guy who was mean enough to stick around was me.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Was you.</span></p>

<span id="s102">From all sides.</span> <span id="s103">Because my mother’s sister, which was married in -- in Zagreb to attorney, she didn’t -- they didn’t have any kids.</span> <span id="s104">So she really dir-directed all her attention towards me, from day I was born, and as the history developed, when she finally lost her husband in Italy, I brought her to America and she lived in my house til she died.</span> <span id="s105">Sh -- but Mom went before, we had to take her to the old age home --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: -- because we couldn’t handle it at home, which I took care of her til she died.</span> <span id="s108">It was kind of payoff -- payoff back time.</span> <span id="s109">And I-I was delighted to have an opportunity, because she was to me like a second mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: You know, anything I couldn’t get from my folks, I was playing like a fiddle.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I know where to turn, and she did it.</span> <span id="s114">Especially when I was growing up in Italy, and going to the faculty and so on, and I start dating, they saying she financed everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: She financed everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q:

absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: And she knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So before the war, you lived in Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: My -- my p -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: A pr-pretty comfortable life.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: My grandfather, he started with a little ma -- grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: He was a grocer before he moved there.</span> <span id="s127">See, the hard times, they didn’t have that much grocery.</span> <span id="s128">And he was like a [indecipherable], my grandfather.</span> <span id="s129">He figure out, this is little community, they don’t have a grocery store, I think we can prosper here.</span> <span id="s130">So it didn’t take very much money, he came over there and he opened his grocery store, and that was the first one in the town.</span> <span id="s131">The most [indecipherable] whatever is like a supply from home that used to go the town and bring few grocery, and people -- farmer used to know where to go.</span> <span id="s132">This was really legitimate grocery store.</span> <span id="s133">And then he was diversified, become bigger [indecipherable] little bit of dry goods [indecipherable] then he was taking care of baker, we bring a [indecipherable] stores, we would sell a bread.</span> <span id="s134">And we was prospering.</span> <span id="s135">And that’s how they, you know, he was doing better and better.</span> <span id="s136">Family really took off when my grandmother play Austro-Hungarian lottery.</span> <span id="s137">And she won 250,000 florins, which my grandfather never knew that she bought, because he was really a dominant figure, he would never allow play lottery.</span> <span id="s138">And then when they open the brick factory and that really took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: They we really become money -- richest people in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: In that town --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: In town, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: -- in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: -- bat -- five Jewish family.</span> <span id="s145">In five Jewish family, we were controlling the town.</span> <span id="s146">I hate to tell you that.</span> <span id="s147">Our friend Mostar, which still lives there, he had a flour mill.</span> <span id="s148">Then we had a other Jewish family who was a general manager of this flour mill.</span> <span id="s149">And then we had a pharmacist, who was the other guy who was taking care of.</span> <span id="s150">And then finally was -- oh, the guy here that -- bar and a beer joint, and entertainment hall.</span> <span id="s151">The town didn’t have a -- like theater.</span> <span id="s152">When used to come a roving circus in town or -- or -- or silent movie in town, that hall was where was showing it.</span> <span id="s153">So really, there’s five Jewish family were the key family in town.</span> <span id="s154">At that time they didn’t feel very anti-Semitic because there’s a close relationship with the community.</span> <span id="s155">Community was quite poor, so most of the business conducted was on credit, and all those Jews extended credit to the farmer, like the flour mill that would pay more after they got the grain collected, they sold it.</span> <span id="s156">And then in carry -- [indecipherable] of the books, so was -- everything was going fine.</span> <span id="s157">But later on we found out it was not enough, and the Nazis come in, it was only a front for their convenience.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: People that we didn’t expect to be in our -- our corner, they come.</span> <span id="s160">And the people that we counted on, they disappointed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s162">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: But yo -- I’m going -- I don’t want to go ahead of you in chronological order.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: It’s all right, I can always -- I can always come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah, you can just go ahead, stop me at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s167">How big a town was this, about ?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Okay, we had a city hall in our town, and town which in itself has about 3,000 population.</span> <span id="s169">But the community, or the commune where they will call it, had obtain other off shops --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: -- that used to belong to all that.</span> <span id="s172">So all together you would tell by the 20,000 people belonged to the commune.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So that’s big enough to support all these businesses --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: -- cause the small, little town couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s177">Because we had the big -- like, for example, lots of stock.</span> <span id="s178">So once a month was the stock market where the butchers used to come by, all the stock what they need.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Then farmer will bring it there, and that’s where they do it.</span> <span id="s181">They -- they once a month a big market.</span> <span id="s182">The -- the vendor with the tent come in the town to -- you know, to supplement thing where the town didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: But did they wanted to go to a bigger town, the be -- he -- the two of them, one was about 15 miles away, the other 25 miles away.</span> <span id="s185">But was still quite far away for a guy who was coming with horse and buggy.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Yeah, sure.</span> <span

and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Ma -- ba -- my father was extremely good looking guy, and my mother was extremely jealous woman.</span> <span id="s195">And my father being -- for the business is always traveling all over, and wa -- and women loved him, and that’s exactly didn’t go big time with my mother.</span> <span id="s196">Now, we never used to go to Zagreb, which is the capital of Croatia.</span> <span id="s197">My uncle, who was married to that aunt of mine that -- I di -- he was a big prankster, he was attorney.</span> <span id="s198">Corporate attorney, brilliant.</span> <span id="s199">A matter of fact, he was representing my mother wealthy brother in a course against German ag -- during the Hitler, in 1936.</span> <span id="s200">This wealthy uncle of mine, he had -- he was a -- he had a dealership for Agrell car factory for all Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s201">And then some misunderstanding happened, and the German company sued him in international court.</span> <span id="s202">And my -- this attorney -- brother-in-law defended brother-in-law, and he won against the Nazis, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s203">But that’s -- but this guy, this attorney, whenever my father will come to Zagreb for business, and you know how my mother was wildly jealous.</span> <span id="s204">He would go put a silk stocking in his shoes, or a note.</span> <span id="s205">One time he put a -- he had had two theater tickets in his pocket, because he know when my mother come home she’s going to go through the pocket to clean them, and they

<p><span id="s217">A: I found it out when I was already there, because don’t forget the I -- when I left Croatia, I was almost Bar Mitvah’d, 12 and a half years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: So this bickering, I was laughing, was very funny, because they -- didn’t take him long to discover th-that my uncle pulled the trick.</span></p> <p><span

long story, and we -- on the end they gi -- bor -- when they have to go in the hiding when the Nazi come in, they tell you, she give us cash, so we can go in the hiding.</span> <span id="s229">But it was the woman’s birthday, so my father goes to kiss her, wish her happy birthday, who walks in is my mother.</span> <span id="s230">And he say, I was wishing happy birthday.</span> <span id="s231">So

in Croatia, the first thing they done, they confiscated our property immediately.</span> <span id="s323">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Did you -- let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s325">Had you been hearing -- I don’t know how -- how politically conscious your family was.</span> <span id="s326">Were they talking politics, they know what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: We were very politically conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: The -- only my uncle, this wealthy one, we -- even when the Nazi was marching in the Austria, we all tried to push Prussia, let’s get hell out of here.</span> <span id="s330">He believed that nothing’s going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s331">And being that he was the dominant figure in our whole family, in a -- like a clan, everybody follow his example, nobody broke loose and said I’m -- hell with you, I’m going to go to America.</span> <span id="s332">He believed that nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s333">Well, it didn’t work this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s335">But your father, wa -- did he want to go to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: My father wanted to go already in ‘36.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Because of what was happening, or because he want --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Because a -- because as soon as the Hitler went on the power, my father say hell, get out of here.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: He envision where is going, way before the anschluss of Austria and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: But then he got stuck there because he was taking care of all the property --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: -- my grandparent, my -- my grandmother was dot -- dead, but my grandfather was still alive.</span> <span id="s345">So it was no way to get away except if the -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Break off.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: -- i-if my uncle would have go ahead decide let’s liquidate and let’s leave, they would -- they work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Both of us, we got stuck there.</span> <span id="s350">But when the -- wi -- you were interested when the Nazi came in, you want me to take it from there on?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Well no, I’m in -- I’m also interested to know what you’re feeling as a kid, before the Nazis even come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: We -- we were aware of the Nazi threat way, way before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Because when the Nazi entered in Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Right, in ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: -- in 1938 --</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: -- in the anschluss, mass emigration of Viennese Jews in Austria came to Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Now, there were only two country in Europe that were taking Jews, Yugoslavia and Italy.</span> <span id="s361">Yugoslavia because they thought that nothing is going to happen, and Italy done it because some -- for some Viennese Jews, especially I would call it aristocrat, professor, doctor and genius, Yugoslavia is not very appealing.</span> <span id="s362">Italy was much more appealing.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Now, I’m sure you heard, you know, the part that my wife explained it to you, and you know with the fi -- how Italy opened the border.</span> <span id="s365">Mussolini -- it was Mussolini, I want you to emphasize that, who was under pressure of Hitler nonstop to do something about the Jews, he kept putting him off.</span> <span id="s366">Because from day Mussolini enter in the -- in power, in October of 1928, the l -- his liberation in Grand Sasso by Colonel Scorcese, German paratroopers, and then whisk him back to Germany.</span> <span id="s367">Nobody touched a J-Jew in Italia, not a single Jew was killed.</span> <span id="s368">They put a pressure on them, they made their life miserable, but was not life threatening, because Mussolini was put in power by Jews.</span> <span id="s369">Well lots of Italian Jewish aristocrats, they were Fascists when he come in power.</span> <span id="s370">People don’t know that.</span> <span id="s371">So he was -- he felt obliged to them, like bonhommes, and all these Jews were still you have in Italy perpetuate in the dynasty in their family, but he was under pressure, and he was passing the racial law to pacify --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Because original Mussolini, he had the agreement with Schuschnigg that if Hitler attack Austria, he is going to defend Austria.</span> <span id="s374">And he’s a chick -- hit -- and Mussolini chickened out.</span> <span id="s375">He figured, hey, that guys is stronger, I’m not going to go with my head against the wall.</span> <span id="s376">And they got involved in this thing.</span> <span id="s377">But that got Nazi in the war, it concern us as a Jewish, as a salvation.</span> <span id="s378">If you notice, every Jew entering that passport Italy didn't stamp it.</span> <span id="s379">He didn’t want any record how many Jew he let in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Like when my wife was in the concentration camp, this was like -- first [indecipherable] to go help him that some Jews are th -- I have a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s382">But this concentration in Ferramonti di Tarsia was a joke.</span> <span id="s383">Now, I have a friend who will live in Tarsia, and he was telling me story, and I unfortunately don’t have his picture, Italian guard around there, there was little booth where they stayed and guard, but they couldn’t stay there because was -- the little grocery store, with the cigarettes and the fruit and the candy.</span> <span id="s384">So even if it’s raining, they just stay in front of booths, they’re doing business with the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s385">So you come to the fence, and you tell the -- ah, Jojo, come here.</span> <span id="s386">He say, what you need?</span> <span id="s387">Two pack of cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Yeah, that was before --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: So, you know.</span> <span id="s390">And even in the life in the camp in itself is much completely different life because they, you know, nobody worry about the life.</span> <span id="s391">There were so many engineers, doctors, like Evie told you, when she hurts her finger, everybody come running.</span> <span id="s392">That was cream de la cream of Vienna, mostly Vienna, in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s393">Now -- now I’m going back to Yugoslavia and Croatia.</span> <span id="s394">Croatia didn’t have an organized Jewish community when j -- Viennese Jews start coming Croatia.</span> <span id="s395">So what the Croatian community in its -- in itself done -- because you have to remember, whole Yugoslavia had 60,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s396">That the more Jews in one little town in Poland, the whole damn country of Croatia had -- yugo -- not Croatia, Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s397">Now, Croatia would have approximately 12,000 Jews, more or less.</span> <span id="s398">So wealthy Jews in Croatia, being they were not organized, each one took a family in the house for boarding and sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: From -- from --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: From Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: From Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s403">I’m talking 1938 - ’39.</span> <span id="s404">Now mine uncle [indecipherable] in business, and he couldn’t babysit or take care of the people in the house.</span> <span id="s405">He took a little hotel in Zagreb called Hotel Astoria, and -- and there were 22 rooms, and he put 22 Jewish family in that hotel for duration, food and everything included.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: On his own, without anything to do with the community.</span> <span id="s408">What those poor people didn’t realize, that this hotel was taken lease in 1939, and the [indecipherable] lasted only til Easter of 1941, they had to run again.</span> <span id="s409">So the people who choose Italy, they made a better choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: I just want to tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: -- a mechanic behind the Croatian Jews help the Viennese Jews.</span> <span id="s414">Some Viennese Jews made it to Belgrade.</span> <span id="s415">Now Belgrade Serbia had a much bigger Jewish community.</span> <span id="s416">And Serbian people as a overall, were less anti-Semitic --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: -- because King Alexander was a big friend of Jews.</span> <span id="s419">You -- you -- you -- I’m sure you know who I am talking about.</span> <span id="s420">King of Serbia, of Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: And King Staff, you know, Dr. Alkali and all these minister were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s423">So the Jews had it pretty darn good from the day that Yugoslavia -- inception of Yugoslavia, til the Yugoslavia fell apart in the whole country.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: So you didn’t grow up with the feelings of being Jewish and there being anti-Semitism in Croatia?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: I -- I -- I -- I brought up in this little community that I know that was anti-Semitism because you always had -- you have it every place.</span> <span id="s426">If you don’t have a community that’s anti-Semitic -- I mean, I can see -- I felt it which is there, but not to the extent to be threatened.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: A matter of fact, the kids I went to the school is right now one of them is a surgeon who just retired in Zagreb, Croatia, every time I go over there I’m his houseguest.</span> <span id="s429">I mean, we grew up together, we hang her up all the time.</span> <span id="s430">And -- and other guy was a son of the post officer manager.</span> <span id="s431">He’s living in Opatia in -- in Croatia, also.</span> <span id="s432">I’m in -- with him in touch all the time.</span> <span id="s433">So I keep in touch with few of them that they remain our friend, even that we couldn’t -- but when they came -- when we couldn’t during the war.</span> <span id="s434">But when we come to run, the saddest part it is -- and I’m know that you’ll be interested in this, when the Nazi come in, they confiscated our property, they come in April, by na -- by June all our property gone, grocery store, factory and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: They send so-called supervisor to run -- they were totally inept.</span> <span id="s437">I mean, to -- one -- they sold what was on stock, they were i -- in heap of trouble.</span> <span id="s438">But to punish my father, first they send him on a false labor in a old orchards.</span> <span id="s439">They had the big orchard with 4,000 trees of fruits.</span> <span id="s440">So all town could see the Jews is coming over there, cleaning the veets and all that.</span> <span id="s441">And when this got old -- and my mother was working with him, too -- then took my father to the -- ready to ship into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s442">And they took him to Zagreb where -- to be shipped to the infamous camp of Jasenovac, okay?</span> <span id="s443">But my aunt, married to attorney in Zagreb, she and the guy -- when she was going to the [indecipherable] who was th -- at that time she didn't realize, he was a fifth column, that’s a -- you know what’s a fifth ca -- the -- the German Nazi underground all over Europe.</span> <span id="s444">She didn’t know that, but he was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s445">And when Hitler took over, and the Nazi state of Croatia was created, she seeing his picture that he become police commissioner.</span> <span id="s446">So she call him.</span> <span id="s447">His name was Medwid.</span> <span id="s448">And he told Medwid, listen, what the hell happen, I thought that you love us.</span> <span id="s449">He said, I still love you, but that’s [indecipherable] my job for me.</span> <span id="s450">I -- I believe in a free Croatia.</span> <span id="s451">I didn’t believe the Serb that should dominate [indecipherable] okay then, I don’t want to talk politics, I have a problem.</span> <span id="s452">My brother-in-law is in Zbore where they put the -- sending people.</span> <span id="s453">Said, don’t worry, I take care of it.</span> <span id="s454">So he say okay, tomorrow morning he is going to be out, have his family from Zabno, from my hometown come, I’m gonna give them papers so they can go in there to Italian border, and then clandestine over the mountain crossing with Italy, you couldn’t just legally cross to Italy, because that’s already ’41.</span> <span id="s455">Don’t forget, Evie come with the passport in 1938 --</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: -- I couldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: That’s already different ballgame.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: We’re going to have to stop the tape, I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s461">We’ll continue this.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Zdenko, I -- I understand that y-your family was so conscious of what was going on that you had a family boycott of all German goods, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s466">We started already doing it in 1938, and I was very upset because I -- there’s some -- even Berkly German toys, fantastic toys, I mean they’re the best toys on eur -- i -- on European market.</span> <span id="s467">Everything disappeared in 1938.</span> <span id="s468">I used to like to have a little lead soldiers, I mean the whole army, in trucks and all the stuff.</span> <span id="s469">It was not allowed in our hou -- any part to our family, not even family that was bringing me toys.</span> <span id="s470">So the -- we did -- we were very much aware what was going on.</span> <span id="s471">Unfortunately, didn’t do nothing about it, they still kept s-same -- do business in -- in Yugoslavia, but we knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s473">Did this make you feel bad as a kid, or did you understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: It made me feel bad to the point because we’ll -- my dad, especially, he was very fearful, he -- he always wanted to get out of it for so -- like I told you before.</span> <span id="s475">So I’ve become very uncomfortable because my dad could not expand his business, he was holding back, while his brother-in-law, my mother’s wealthy brother, he was increasing it.</span> <span id="s476">Now, when it was time to go ahead and run, and pick our marble and go, he started building a f -- mill, steel mill, steel, now listen.</span> <span id="s477">One the biggest steel mill that’s today exists in Croatia, my uncle start building in 1938.</span> <span id="s478">Insane, absolutely insane, because he was so commi -- he felt like a big Croat.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: So he thought he needed three mills?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yeah, he -- yeah, he really thought nothing is going to happen, people will appreciate, he was always big patriot.</span> <span id="s481">You me -- my uncle by self, supported Catholic church in my hometown.</span> <span id="s482">I mean, priests that he needed money for new roof didn’t go to -- to Zagreb talk to bishop.</span> <span id="s483">He talking what, to guys from our hometown, he got the damn l-lumber yard, and a st -- a -- a brick factory, and they’re making a roof covers and all that, the clay tile.</span> <span id="s484">Why am I gonna go to bishop when I got here [indecipherable] or go to Zagreb, next time come to town, and I got [indecipherable] talk to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I mean, when they used to come bless the home for the Christian holidays, I mean, the priest went first to five Jewish houses.</span> <span id="s487">He collected more money than whole the rest of town.</span> <span id="s488">So you see how [indecipherable] integrated with this community.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So there wasn’t a sense, even though everybody knew that there was a difference in people’s religious orientation --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yeah, no, you -- no -- it was not really a threat or a feel of a strong anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: We only realized how much was fake to some extent, when we had to finally leave our hometown like I told you before because my father was taken to go to the camp, and we had to follow him when the news come that we are ready to get hell out of there, nobody come to the street to say good-bye.</span> <span id="s493">There’s only one family, close to the railroad station, that tell us well, if you have to leave, come over, we want to give you dinner before you go on the train.</span> <span id="s494">But the rest of the town was hiding behind the curtain.</span> <span id="s495">And the sooner we got over there, like vultures they cleaned up the house much as they can.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s497">Did Germans come into your little town in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: The German come in oy -- war started Easter weekend of ’41, the Germans actually -- in vel -- their physical presence was there 14 days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: So they really were physically present.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yeah, we did -- we did tro -- they come to our store.</span> <span id="s501">My father was still running his grocery store, and they were so starved for fine toiletry, like fine soap, smelly soap and stuff, they bought everything.</span> <span id="s502">They give us the German marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Were you frightened when you saw these German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes, yes, they were very imposing, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: They were imposing.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Because th -- you could notice -- I didn’t see ess -- S.S. troopers, I saw only soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: So they already scaring hell out of me.</span> <span id="s509">But when you see a really S.S. trooper, i-it’s ri -- it looks to me like a liquidation squads, with the black uniform, with the skullcaps, the marching group.</span> <span id="s510">They were so programmed, like the robotics today that you see.</span> <span id="s511">It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s512">I mean, I think they invented the robotic before their time.</span> <span id="s513">I mean, it is funny.</span> <span id="s514">A -- later on when we were already liberated, I used to make fun of the damn S.S. because it’s so funny.</span> <span id="s515">One of them is coming, and you’re hop, hop [indecipherable] hop, and everybody jump like a bunch of yoyos.</span> <span id="s516">I mean, I can see that later on when I was serving American army, I was laughing, said boy this German officer would die if he would come over here.</span> <span id="s517">He would try to run American army the way do that.</span> <span id="s518">But they were very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s519">Never question a order.</span> <span id="s520">I mean, they come in the town, they say -- I saw in Italy, after Italy capitulated, and German took over, and then when they kill two German, the partisan, they took

--</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Okay, let me explain you.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: After we got those document to get my father out of the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: -- we went to the border town ca-called Kraljevica.</span> <span id="s613">That’s was Italian zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s614">Now, Italy had the two zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s615">I want go slow to try to give you the picture.</span> <span id="s616">One zone they consider occupation zone.</span> <span id="s617">When you were in occupation zone, you were not safe, because you -- the Croatian Nazis, and Italian occupation forces together.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: And is that the north?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: The north tri --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: -- I’m talking about north.</span> <span id="s622">O-Over there

right.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: When you enter to the joint Italian an-annexed to Italy, like Ljubljana, you know, they consider part of Italy, you have it made.</span> <span id="s628">So our job, after they finally get in a s-s -- half safety zone, an occupied zone, to get to annexed zone, this was a big thr -- because we know, if we reach Ljubljana, we are free.</span> <span id="s629">And we manage again, with the help of a -- how would you call it, of city manager of a little community by Opatia, you know, in the northern -- little commun -- maybe 1200 population.</span> <span id="s630">My father become friend with him, he know that we are in hiding, he said listen, I will need a paper to declare us that we are resident of Grobnik and we have to go to business to Ljubljana because we have to catch a bus.</span> <span id="s631">And give us some names f -- cock and bull, whatever you want to make.</span> <span id="s632">And he give us temporary pass with all this stamps and what y -- and we caught the bus from spl -- Rijeka, that is right of Opatia, to Ljubljana.</span> <span id="s633">We pass few checkpoint.</span> <span id="s634">Croatia Nazis and Italian.</span> <span id="s635">Once we enter in Ljubljana, we went directly to Italian authority said hey, we are here, the Jews from Croatia, we want to apply for confinement in Italy.</span> <span id="s636">That’s ag -- very good.</span> <span id="s637">Now here come the new information that fo -- Evie didn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s638">She said they got a subsidy.</span> <span id="s639">Italian [indecipherable] to all the Jews that didn’t have nothing, and they had to eat.</span> <span id="s640">And they just have them all in camp, because there were whole bunch of them, and the only known camp was Ferramonti di Tarsia.</span> <span id="s641">Didn’t have any other camps.</span> <span id="s642">Had to give them livelihood.</span> <span id="s643">Every head of the family got a five lira a day, wife got three lira a day, for each kids, two lira a day.</span> <span id="s644">So if you add it up, it was not enough for a fantastic life, but you would not be hungry.</span> <span id="s645">To give you idea how [indecipherable] to a real -- what, over 300 lira something.</span> <span id="s646">A rent would cost you 120 lira a month, approximately in the little communities.</span> <span id="s647">The rest of it for your food.</span> <span id="s648">So they give you enough money to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: So when we arrived in Ljubljana, we apply for subsidy.</span> <span id="s651">Til my uncle Rich Rada, til he find out where we were.</span> <span id="s652">Once he find out we were -- he was running too, because he was in Italy, in Aosta.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: In Aosta?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Aosta --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Aosta, uh-huh.</span></p>

Swiss say welcome Mr. Rada.</span> <span id="s662">Now for rest of us a different story.</span> <span id="s663">But when he -- once he becoming -- got into safety -- and even before, when we were confined in Modena -- we were sent to Modena, by the way, which -- this a breadbasket of Italy.</span> <span id="s664">The most fantastic cuisine if you can ever dream.</span> <span id="s665">And then we [indecipherable] by this Italian family like I mentioned before that helped us eventually, we even -- Italian -- they -- you know, this was the war.</span> <span id="s666">So even Italian when they want to go over there and get a supply for the winter, they have to go city hall, get a permission to buy a pig.</span> <span id="s667">They’ll have a pig, or the cow, have it butchered, and then they will take it home, and they will [indecipherable] and refrigerate it -- because they didn’t have a refrigerator in every house, but there were lockers that you could rent at -- to store the -- fre-freeze the stuff.</span> <span id="s668">My father went with rest Italians have on the permission to buy a pig.</span> <span id="s669">The Italian give him a pig, he had the pig butchered.</span>

the meat all supply and the fat for cooking, because we were not used yet, to olive oil.</span> <span id="s673">It’s later on that you acquire the taste for olive oil, and we completely [indecipherable] lard --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: -- and [indecipherable] that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: All right, now I -- I want to go back because I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s677">Once your fa -- once you have your papers for your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: --

the house, in our house, he bury it in the house.</span> <span id="s835">Now, that was 1941.</span> <span id="s836">In 19 -- we came to Kansas City, ’49, in 1955 - 1955, a Croatian guy -- well, I -- you know, it’s so difficult tell you my story in a -- in right chronological order.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: It’s fine, it’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: And I’m jumping.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: I’ll -- I’ll remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: When we were sent to Kansas City --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: -- you know, at random, we didn’t have no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: The Jewish community just send us to Kansas City, and -- and my mother said, you know, Kansas City, I think that one guy that work for us on our brick factory, he -- he got married and he went to Kansas City.</span> <span id="s845">And his name was Nicola Rodina.</span> <span id="s846">I wonder if he’s living in this town.</span> <span id="s847">Now he come before the war, first World War, to marry his sweetheart, then war happen, he couldn’t come back to America.</span> <span id="s848">So he and his sweetheart live -- and he worked for my grandfather and my dad til the war was over, and then after the war, around 1930, went back to Kansas City, where he started.</span> <span id="s849">And he was working -- you know, Kansas City was third biggest city for meat packing house, and you had the Swift, [indecipherable] Armour, all of them were in Kansas City.</span> <span id="s850">So they were working because didn’t need much language to be a butcher.</span> <span id="s851">So Mother go over there, pick up in the telephone book [indecipherable] Rodina.</span> <span id="s852">And he had a son about my age, and we [indecipherable] right away, and we become friend.</span> <span id="s853">But in 1955, this Nic Rodina that used to work for us, goes back to Croatia for first time.</span> <span id="s854">And my father said, “Nic, you want to do me a favor.</span> <span id="s855">In my house,” and he write him -- make him a sketch of -- a schematic.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: “In this part I buried all of our silverware.</span> <span id="s858">Take a shovel, see what the hell is there.”</span> <span id="s859">He take a shovel, the first time he pushed it -- because our basement by the way, it was no concrete.</span> <span id="s860">Basements are dirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: The first time he push a shovel in, it hit the metal box with the stuff.</span> <span id="s863">The first.</span> <span id="s864">Took him exactly 10 seconds to hit a spot.</span> <span id="s865">Right on the money.</span> <span id="s866">He brought all the silver.</span> <span id="s867">Now whatever was silver was okay, but we discovered the handles, you know what I mean, it was not silver.</span> <span id="s868">Knife, and blade and the stem was silver.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: So when you brought everything -- spoons were no problem, forks were no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: But knives.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I’m talking knife.</span> <span id="s873">So when he brought it to Kansas City we had the new stems put with the -- I got -- the silver was there in Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: The same --</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: -- silver yes, but [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s876">So silver didn’t rot, but whatever it was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: -- what was not silver, it rot.</span> <span id="s879">That was just like a little postscript to -- to the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did you have to be explained why you were going, or was it really clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: No, it wa -- I -- to me it was very clear why I was going, you know, when -- when we first arrived and were confined in this little community of -- of si -- Concordia Santa Catarina, which is, you know -- Modena is a breadbasket of Italy.</span> <span id="s882">Wheat, grain, fruit, you name it.</span> <span id="s883">So they told us right away in -- Italian police in Ljubljana, they say hey, you guys, you got it made.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: How did you know in Ljubljana that you were going to Modena?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: We didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Oh, you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: We came over there -- my dad come over there to police department.</span> <span id="s888">[indecipherable] say, we are going to send you to Italy, insi -- inside Italy, and you’ll be confined to a little community.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: And they gave a whole bunch regulation, you cannot socialize with Italians, you cannot work over there.</span> <span id="s891">You have to report to the f -- fascio.</span> <span id="s892">This the Fascist head police once a day, head of the family, so we know that you are in the town.</span> <span id="s893">They’re not going to look for you, you better show up there.</span> <span id="s894">And give us all these rules.</span> <span id="s895">And that -- that was not difficult to f -- to -- to follow.</span> <span id="s896">But the Italian [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s897">I mean, I cannot find the words to describe my love for Italian, because when we arrived to the -- in Modena, and we went to questura, which is a police headquarters, which in Fascist Italy -- and I’m not talking regular police, I’m talking Fascist Italy.</span> <span id="s898">Italian everything they do they have their own political version.</span> <span id="s899">Even Italian communists go to church.</span> <span id="s900">I’m telling you how ridiculous it is.</span> <span id="s901">The red shirts and the flag in the church at the confession.</span> <span id="s902">So they -- they modified the -- the convenient.</span> <span id="s903">So we go to this questura and he tell us, now these are the community around here.</span> <span id="s904">Do you have any particular town that would you like to be confined?</span> <span id="s905">And my father say I would like to go to a little town that is not expensive, and that there are nice food around.</span> <span id="s906">They says, I’ll tell you where I’m going to send you to Concordia sua Secchia.</span> <span id="s907">Secchia is a be -- river.</span> <span id="s908">Concordia on the ri -- on the Secchia river.</span> <span id="s909">He says, fantastic bread, everything was rationed, the -- with the farmer really, your ration cards would be superfluous even if you sh -- needed to go to the store, but farmer will supply whatever you want over there and you can enjoy yourself.</span> <span id="s910">And he gave us all this rule that we go over there.</span> <span id="s911">So when we trooped up to this lady, that she was divorced for a high ranking Italian officer, she was living with a sister and a daughter.</span> <span id="s912">Daughter was about -- I was at that time already fi 15, I think -- no, maybe 14 and a half, 15, she was 18.</span> <span id="s913">And so there she was looking, oh my God, I -- she was in [indecipherable] in a sexy and all that.</span> <span id="s914">And then my family engaged her to teach me Italian.</span> <span id="s915">And my Uncle Pawel, and Ruza are already with us, in the same house [indecipherable] with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Is that the Mitrani and adio --</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Mitrani, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Andreoli?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Andreoli Mitrani.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: And is it Andreoli mita -- Mit-Mitrani?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Mitrani Andreoli.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Andreoli.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Mitrani is the woman married to the [indecipherable], Andreoli is the sister, because sister never marry.</span> <span id="s924">So she keep the maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: The Italian officer was named Mitrani.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: And they had a daughter, Anna Maria, and she was teaching me Italian.</span> <span id="s931">And my uncle, he was looking over there from the balcony when she was teaching me Italian.</span> <span id="s932">He says, “You know, Zdenko, if you want to learn Italian -- I watch you from balcony, you have to stop staring at her breasts.</span> <span id="s933">I mean, are you -- you are not paying one word of attention what the woman’s teaching.”</span> <span id="s934">I said, “How do you know?”</span> <span id="s935">He said, “I’m watching you from window [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s936">Said, do you know any -- do you know anything what she told you?</span> <span id="s937">And I would ba-ba-ba, I start [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s938">He was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: And that was the end of my staring.</span> <span id="s941">And he told her, he says, you know, you’re a yu -- pretty young lady, and you want nephew to teach him Italian, dress up a little different.</span> <span id="s942">A young boy, his hormones star -- start working, you know, make possible for him to concentrate what you are doing.</span> <span id="s943">But was very funny, that -- that’s a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: -- postscript into the whole story.</span> <span id="s946">But they took us in.</span> <span id="s947">Now, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: No, wait, I’m going to have stop you because we -- I’m sorry, we have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: How long are you in the occupied zone before you get to Lub -- Ljubljana, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Nine months, yes, we were hiding in a little town called Silvo, S-i-l-v-o.</span> <span id="s956">Real --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: S-i-v-l-o?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Oh, yeah, this town was maybe 200 population.</span> <span id="s959">Is right between commune of Grobnik, that I mentioned before, and Shushak.</span> <span id="s960">Really a small town, but we -- we tried to be a -- you know, a -- a -- as unseen as possible.</span> <span id="s961">So we found in a -- by -- old lady, you know, about 75 years old, she had a room to rent.</span> <span id="s962">So my parents, they kind of crammed in there, and nobody in town know about us, that we even there.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Now why are you hiding there?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: We are hiding there because was Italian occupation there, but we’re afraid if Italian get hold of us, they might turn us back to the Croatian Nazi because they hi -- they were sharing authority in that zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: There was not completely Italian authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: So how -- who was figuring out how to get out?</span> <span id="s968">This was your father who was --</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Well, when we were there we were aware that in order to reach a complete safety we have to go in Italian zone, which is annexed.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Not occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Quote unquote, there’s a big difference annexed and occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: And we know that because we’ve still -- we still saw even that Italian had the final word.</span> <span id="s976">Now, if you were -- we got caught one time by Italians.</span> <span id="s977">See, is only [indecipherable] what Italian catch you.</span> <span id="s978">One time they caught us, they were ready to ship us back to Zagreb and the -- and we were begging, please don’t send us, you know what’s waiting for us.</span> <span id="s979">They guy say, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s980">So there were five Italian cops, and they were arguing between them, we couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s981">Little bit, not very much.</span> <span id="s982">They were dickering.</span> <span id="s983">One guys said, let them go, why the hell you playing around with them?</span> <span id="s984">And they said no we can’t help it, our duty -- well, we are -- we allied of Germany.</span> <span id="s985">Send them back to Zagreb.</span> <span id="s986">So it’s -- they said, you know what, let’s make a smart thing.</span> <span id="s987">So you want feel guilty that you didn’t carry order and that I didn’t carry order.</span> <span id="s988">Let’s tell them that we go for lunch, and we be back in 30 minutes and that’s why they don’t -- and I don’t have to tell you how quick we [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s989">But that’s only happen in Italy.</span> <span id="s990">I mean, all the Italian with the stuff like they said, hey listen you guys, you are [indecipherable] in the arrest but by the way we go for lunch, but don’t go anyplace, we’ll be back in 30 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Could you understand some Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: But -- no, but once I got in Italy, young, I couldn't go to school, so the only organized playground is the church backyard.</span> <span id="s995">Everybody was there.</span> <span id="s996">I mean, they -- the movies, priest was showing, you had the ping pong table, he had the basketball tab -- ev-everything what the kids in this little town which we were confined, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s997">So I become, you know, with -- when you are with the kids, you pick up Italian very fast.</span> <span id="s998">And for me is no problem to ge-get integrated.</span> <span id="s999">A matter of fact, to a certain point, I got integrated little too much because my parents noticed that I was going st -- sitting at the mass, and the one time they short of the kids, and the priest talked me into be -- helping serve the mass, and I come home, I could serve the mass better than those Italian kids.</span> <span id="s1000">Why?</span> <span id="s1001">Because during the Hebrew school -- see, the -- the Testament, Old Testament is same.</span> <span id="s1002">And the kids my age didn’t get to New Testament yet.</span> <span id="s1003">So what they knew, I already was way ahead of them.</span> <span id="s1004">And priest was very impressed with it.</span> <span id="s1005">[indecipherable] told me, how do you know, and he says -- I said we Jews didn’t have to worry about New Testament.</span> <span id="s1006">We worry only about the Old Testament.</span> <span id="s1007">So he said, would you like to go over there and help serve the mass?</span> <span id="s1008">I said why not?</span> <span id="s1009">What is in it for me?</span> <span id="s1010">He says cakes and cookie and hot chocolate.</span> <span id="s1011">I’m in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Now let me go back to Ljubljana again.</span> <span id="s1013">Is -- was this typical that if you got there, you could go to the authorities and say you wanted to get to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Me and 2,000 other ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: There were 2,000 Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: 2,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1017">Even some Austrian Jews.</span> <span id="s1018">Once you reach Ljubljana and you were Jewish, this is such a amazing thing about Fascist Italy.</span> <span id="s1019">That they let you in, but they didn’t want to know you were there.</span> <span id="s1020">Like remember in the previous segment when I told you that they give us list of do and don’t do?</span> <span id="s1021">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Well, when we got over there with all these restriction, and my father’s reports the first morning to the -- to Fascist headquarters, said, here I am.</span> <span id="s1023">Then he come next morning there.</span> <span id="s1024">And finally the third day the guy told him, “Why you bother me here every morning,” he says.</span> <span id="s1025">“I know you are here.”</span> <span id="s1026">He said, “But we supposed to,” -- “I know.</span> <span id="s1027">If you are missing here, somebody’s going to tell me.</span> <span id="s1028">Don’t bother me no more.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Then if you want to go to movie, you need a special permission.</span> <span id="s1031">So I was a young kid, I liked to go to movie, every time they -- there’s a big plaque at the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1032">No American movie, Italian -- Italy made lots of movies, lots of -- many of them propaganda movie and stories and -- and I was going to movie every sun -- when the -- owto -- if Fascist authorities saw me in the movie, they wouldn’t bother, they’d turn around, they didn’t want to see me.</span> <span id="s1033">They didn’t want to know I’m there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: So how -- how -- how did you understand this?</span> <span id="s1035">I mean, you come to Italy, they have anti-Semitic laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Ye-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: The Jews have been thrown out of some occupations, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So there’s a certain level --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: -- of oppression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Then there’s another level where there is no oppression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: No oppression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: It’s -- it’s very --</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Because -- because Italian are flexible.</span> <span id="s1047">That’s a very good word to describe.</span> <span id="s1048">Italian are opportunistic.</span> <span id="s1049">Italian -- no, first time that we come to little town it says, oh, the Fascists told us that you Jews were take -- taking eyes out of the kids and that’s why you’re confined.</span> <span id="s1050">I said that’s a bubkes.</span> <span id="s1051">That’s not true.</span> <span id="s1052">And th -- when they got acquainted with you, when they notice on daily basis the way your people with a -- when they saw that we went, asked the farmer for bread, or to give us some flour, or to share us the flour, everything.</span> <span id="s1053">We th -- it -- it was unbelievable, the response of the community, we feel so comfortable.</span> <span id="s1054">Now we come to the -- the September, or armistice, that we got so excited, and finally the war is over.</span> <span id="s1055">At this point, Americans already past Sicily, they landed on the boot of Italy, and on Calabria.</span> <span id="s1056">And they’re marching their way the boot.</span> <span id="s1057">And we are in Florence.</span> <span id="s1058">That’s like 450 miles down the boot.</span> <span id="s1059">Lots of mountains.</span> <span id="s1060">So we, a little educated, we knew what was expected that there’s not going to be a pancake, especially the German from the Brenner --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: -- were coming out.</span> <span id="s1063">But when we had to run to go back when -- when the Italy collapsed, you know, and when we had to run, the questura, the -- these Fascist headquarters that tell my father pick up where you want to go, he send the word to the priest of the town telling people to get -- he had a -- a lot of that, because starting tomorrow Nazi are taking over, I’m out of business.</span> <span id="s1064">[indecipherable] ever protect him, so whatever you can do for them, do for them.</span> <span id="s1065">Then the -- the Andreoli relayed this to us.</span> <span id="s1066">Andreoli had the connection with the priest in Florence, and they call that priest in the Florence, said we got these refugees here, and we’re going to have to put them someplace because Americans are coming up the boot, we know that it is only a question of time.</span> <span id="s1067">Can you help us?</span> <span id="s1068">So the priest said, I see what I can do.</span> <span id="s1069">And sure enough [indecipherable] they couldn't s -- we had only hours, said okay, tell him to go to -- to Florence, and go to such and such a store in piazza Pitti, you are f-familiar with Florence?</span> <span id="s1070">In piazza Pitti, right in front of the Palazzo, piazza Pitti --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: It’s a little leather good store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Hamer leather goods store, and selling to -- ca -- look for Senor Torchio.</span> <span id="s1075">Senor Torchio is going to take over from there.</span> <span id="s1076">Now this is only two blocks from Ponte Vecchio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: When Ponte Vecchio is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Is on the ri -- that’s right.</span> <span id="s1081">So they say we -- they send us over there, we already on next train, we have a problem.</span> <span id="s1082">We got to make to -- to Florence, and from the station to that store roof, missed the -- we’re -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: How do you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1085">We went on the foot, we didn’t want -- we tried to be like 20 - 30 feet apart, individually, not as a family.</span> <span id="s1086">All these Fascist Italian with the Nazis decoration and I’m talking hard [indecipherable] they volunteered.</span> <span id="s1087">They were embarrassed because Italy collapsed.</span> <span id="s1088">So we -- finally we made over [indecipherable] I got place for you, it’s not very far.</span> <span id="s1089">You go over there, and via Borgo San Jacobo, this is a street right next to Ponte Vecchio, and th-the houses all -- one was on the [indecipherable] and the other was across the street.</span> <span id="s1090">And wa -- were called via Borgo San Jacobo and was going -- extending about three, four blocks.</span> <span id="s1091">He say go and visit -- I forgot the number exactly, and talk to the housekeeper, who take care of palazzo.</span> <span id="s1092">They -- the garden apartment in palazzo.</span> <span id="s1093">She was called -- so called portiniya, you know, that’s a -- in charge of whole building [indecipherable] whoever needs anything.</span> <span id="s1094">Here you would call it doorman, but she was not doorman.</span> <span id="s1095">You come to this, you at s -- anyway, in this apartment was Italian colonel, very big Fascist, who was so ashamed that Italy collapsed, that he volunteered for Russian front.</span> <span id="s1096">Now, what the Nazis did, the S.S. come, seal his apartment, because he knows somebody else is going to try to rob it or take it over, some Nazi or Fascist, so nobody can touch it.</span> <span id="s1097">So obercommand from deutsche politsi sealed the apartment with a seal.</span> <span id="s1098">But she has a key from back door.</span> <span id="s1099">So in this apartment of this Nazi, we were refuges in there with Ruza, with this attorney husband, my father and me.</span> <span id="s1100">Ruza was the only versatile enough to go in the street not to be s-suspected she’s not Italian.</span> <span id="s1101">She blended in perfectly and Italian was quite good.</span> <span id="s1102">So all the supply that we needed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: She got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A:

apartment.</span> <span id="s1108">Ah, there’s a radio, we were listen radio London, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1109">Had everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1111">But you have to hide there, you have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: We are hiding, of course, nobody in building know we are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: And we didn’t worry that some Nazi come in because it’s sealed.</span> <span id="s1115">My mother catch t-typhoid while we are here in that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: So again we go back to Mr. Torchio.</span> <span id="s1120">He said, [indecipherable] okay, I get you a doctor.</span> <span id="s1121">At 11 o’clock at night, Italian Fascist doctor, a major with a Fascist uniform, come over to the door and tell to Neila Fussi, that our house ki -- was hiding at -- say you got here a Jewish family hiding, and she almost doody in her pants.</span> <span id="s1122">She said yes.</span> <span id="s1123">Say, I’m a doctor so and so, that Mr. Torchio send me over, you got some people sick here.</span> <span id="s1124">So he was coming there every night, giving us shots, and taking care of my mother, at the risk of his own life, that’s why he’s coming 11 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s1125">Stealing the serum from the military supply, til my mother got well.</span> <span id="s1126">After the -- four [indecipherable] say no, it’s very dangerous for me and for you, I don’t want to come because somebody might follow me.</span> <span id="s1127">You know, you never what they do [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: -- he said.</span> <span id="s1130">Now, she’s to the point of recovery, she’s not infectious any more, so you can relax a little bit.</span> <span id="s1131">But one thing she is desperate is a vitamin C. Where the hell do you get vitamin C?</span> <span id="s1132">Again you go back to Mr. Torchio, to a -- and don’t worry about it, he said.</span> <span id="s1133">It’s a monastery up there, the hill above Florence, the nuns.</span> <span id="s1134">They growing lemons on the tree inside monastery.</span> <span id="s1135">Next day we had all the lemons and stuff that we wanted.</span> <span id="s1136">Just to give you a little [indecipherable] this is absolutely mind boggling.</span> <span id="s1137">So my mother weather this things out.</span> <span id="s1138">Now, Americans already in front of Florence.</span> <span id="s1139">German are feeling the heat.</span> <span id="s1140">And German Hauptcommander give the order that all the streets facing the Arno River have to evacuate because there’s somebody that screw up in [indecipherable] think American won’t be able cross the arn -- Arno River.</span> <span id="s1141">Now, the only city they didn’t blow up is Ponte Vecchio.</span> <span id="s1142">Now everybody thought that Ponte Vecchio, first of all, Germany loved the arts, and they didn’t want to destroy.</span> <span id="s1143">It was something else, German engineers, they figure out Ponte Vecchio cannot hold American Tiger tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Yeah, so they will not tr -- the Americans are not stupid, is not going to close it.</span> <span id="s1146">So when the Americans -- they didn’t touch it.</span> <span id="s1147">So they left this here.</span> <span id="s1148">With the rest of it, where we lived -- but it didn’t blow up.</span> <span id="s1149">They gave us four hours to move.</span> <span id="s1150">Not us, the whole build -- now we didn’t want [indecipherable] no more, because now we are [indecipherable] with Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: 4,000 refugee in Palazzo Pitti.</span> <span id="s1153">Now, that’s where is -- where all the art gallery be, all the fun stuff.</span> <span id="s1154">Now, the shelf where used to be those expensive things, we took the picture and pile them against the wall, and those were our beds, because they were 18 inches apart.</span> <span id="s1155">Now in the garden there were two wells of water.</span> <span id="s1156">Now, for four days, the 4,000 people only supplied the water for them in this Palazzo Pitti, was this thing.</span> <span id="s1157">No bathroom facility.</span> <span id="s1158">But we really made that flower garden really flourish.</span> <span id="s1159">Now you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Are you staying outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Oh no, no.</span> <span id="s1162">We -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: -- we’re i-in the -- in the garden --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: -- inside, during the night, all of them in the building.</span> <span id="s1167">Younger people, without the kids, they were sl-sleeping in the garden, they didn't want to.</span> <span id="s1168">But for us they give us, with the family, we were using the shelves as a bed.</span> <span id="s1169">Didn’t have no mattress or anything, a blanket, or you coat, whatever you could put under the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: On the fourth day, about three o’clock in the morning, when they blow all the houses, and I hit the -- the air percussion was so strong that my head hit the bunk above it.</span> <span id="s1172">I really -- moved me up [indecipherable] everybody, we know bye-bye, Germans are gone.</span> <span id="s1173">Now here come the Americans.</span> <span id="s1174">You know how long took Americans to cross river?</span> <span id="s1175">They brought those big Caterpillar bulldozer, and they fill up the Arno River in two hours.</span> <span id="s1176">Italians -- the whole Florence come to see what the hell that stupid American’s doing.</span> <span id="s1177">Like nothing.</span> <span id="s1178">They use the ruins of the building, they actually done him a favor.</span> <span id="s1179">They just pushed the debris in the river.</span> <span id="s1180">But they were smart, they couldn’t keep it very long, otherwise they would block the flow of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: When they were on the o-other side, they cleaned it up dimen -- and then they come, American pontoon engineer and put those temporary bridges in -- in 48 hours river was flowing and American was going both direction.</span> <span id="s1183">Now come -- we report right away to American authorities.</span> <span id="s1184">And they tell us, okay, we got the camp in Rome, which all the foreign refugee, now quote unquote, who are awaiting repatriation to their homeland are going ahead to the camp of Cinecitta.</span> <span id="s1185">Now we are going to move you on the trucks partly, and partly the trains, because some part the [indecipherable] train is not working.</span> <span id="s1186">So we have to move you from Rome to Grosseto by truck, and then we put you on the train to Rome.</span> <span id="s1187">We couldn’t care less, we’re sleeping the army tent, I got introduced to the corned beef, and to all the American good stuff with the breakfast.</span> <span id="s1188">Egg -- powdered eggs, the first time in my life, you ever tried them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: You wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1191">You would -- you -- but was all kind of food you wanted.</span> <span id="s1192">Bacon, oh my God, was coming out of your ear.</span> <span id="s1193">And you could eat as much as you want.</span> <span id="s1194">I mean, there’s not such a thing you what -- what is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: And who was cooking?</span> <span id="s1196">What was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1199">So you</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Was ya -- you -- it was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: -- so you were eating with the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: It was regular under tents you know, no building.</span> <span id="s1205">When --</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Under tents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: -- it was sh -- f -- like MASH, only without the hospital in the field tent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: And -- and then they put the truck, take us to Rome.</span> <span id="s1212">Now we arrive -- we were liberated sometime in the first part of the August, th -- took about, I think, one weeks journey from liberation to arrive in Rome.</span> <span id="s1213">By time we arrive in the camp in Rome, Evie was there already because she was liberated four days before me.</span> <span id="s1214">She was further down south.</span> <span id="s1215">But that time her mother was working, her father was working, and in -- in order our family, which was friend of Evie’s from V-Vienna, they were in Ferramonti.</span> <span id="s1216">They were liberated before so they were first in the camp, and that’s was a mother, father, daughter and Kelmer was a son-in-law of that Winkler family.</span> <span id="s1217">Family was Winkler and son-in-law was Kelmer.</span> <span id="s1218">And he was a typical Jewish Viennese finagler.</span> <span id="s1219">Al-Always know his [indecipherable] to find.</span> <span id="s1220">It took him exactly 10 days that he become a general manager of the kitchen for refugee.</span> <span id="s1221">He spoke a little Italian, spoke a little German, he was able to get connection with Americans, say hey look, you’re a guy, we need somebody to run this kitchen, we got about turnover between 900 and thousand prov virtually every week, and we need to put it together a staff to feed and take care of it.</span> <span id="s1222">Now one thing you know about American, they’re not multi-lingual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: So they need a multi-lingual staff to take care of this [indecipherable] because there were 10 - 15 nations.</span> <span id="s1225">But next to us was a Italian camp, still in Cinecitta, just for Italian refugee.</span> <span id="s1226">That Italian [indecipherable] took care of it.</span> <span id="s1227">But was a big different in the food and supply what American were taking care of in Italian [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1228">So Italian refugee would be delighted to be in the foreign camp, but couldn’t get in foreign na -- now, by the end it came they were looking -- i-if car -- is approaching some kind of American holiday, I don’t remember if was Labor day or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1229">And American guys the officer wanted to have a holiday.</span> <span id="s1230">So they ma -- they send a feeler out, any of the refugees you know how to cook, we need a cook and a baker to make cakes.</span> <span id="s1231">So I asked my mo -- my mother says how long for how long.</span> <span id="s1232">He says, well all depend how good you cook.</span> <span id="s1233">So sh -- my mother start cooking for 30 guys.</span> <span id="s1234">Now, Evie’s mother was already working for the employees of the camp.</span> <span id="s1235">Now Kelmer, that guy who was first arrived, he was running refugee kitchen, so I’m telling you how those Jews got all situated in key position.</span> <span id="s1236">Now my mother wa -- pure accidentally because my mother was a gourmet cook and a baker.</span> <span id="s1237">So she prepared, you might think, Labor day meal what -- August was Labor day, because we arrived in August.</span> <span id="s1238">And she cook him a pishinger torte and a Dobish torte, and a Sacher torte, a -- you name it.</span> <span id="s1239">And the guy said -- and then say she cook him paprika golish and stuff.</span> <span id="s1240">Sa -- says hey listen, we got to hook up with the girl.</span> <span id="s1241">So she -- Mother told him, you know what?</span> <span id="s1242">You have three Slovenian guys, helpers.</span> <span id="s1243">All of them know about cooking a little bit.</span> <span id="s1244">I’m considering the deal, but I want those three guys as helpers because I cannot handle it by myself.</span> <span id="s1245">I know these guys know what they are doing, and if I give them direction [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1246">She got the job.</span> <span id="s1247">Now my Aunt Ruza that was liberated with us, when we come to the camp the first thing they want to i-in -- give us injection and all the protection all diseases.</span> <span id="s1248">But my Uncle Pawel ba -- my smart attorney, is like Evie’s brother, no injection of me.</span> <span id="s1249">Nobody’s going to poke me with the needles.</span> <span id="s1250">Next day he left the camp to live in Rome.</span> <span id="s1251">Found hisself a little apartment [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1252">And they never came back to camp.</span> <span id="s1253">Lucky for them [indecipherable] order that my mother got job in the kitchen, because they never had to spend a di -- dollar for grocery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: They came twice a week for the food supply that you will not believe it, the shopping [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1256">It just happened the chief of police, again a refugee, was a gradanier, Serbian gradanier from Belgrade, he was a royal guard, about six foot five, he becomes chief of police.</span> <span id="s1257">We become friendly with him, and that [indecipherable] our family was schlepping this stuff, said did you come for the supplies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: He knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: He not only knew it, he say that’s what they have, you want me to get you Jeep to take you -- they were living in piazzi [indecipherable] maybe only four miles down the road from Cinecitta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: And Ruza is with him?</span> <span id="s1261">Cause it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Yeah, Ruza is with Pawel in the apartment.</span> <span id="s1263">Ruza was carrying, and Pawel, but some of the stuff is heavy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: They had to catch a streetcar to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: So he ask him, you want my Jeep to take you home.</span> <span id="s1268">It was so funny.</span> <span id="s1269">He -- Evie -- when sh -- when Evie was standing next to him, he was resting his elbow over on Evie’s head because she was so small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Sorry.</span> <span id="s1272">But that’s why my mother got employed in the camp in Cinecitta, and -- and we thought we were living like kings.</span> <span id="s1273">Now people, who went out to Rome on their own become wealthy.</span> <span id="s1274">They were dealing with gold, they were dealing with all kind of mishigosha zachen on the black market.</span> <span id="s1275">But we were content, we didn't want to take any chances, we didn’t want to rock the boat, we were very happy and we live like king because we got those private rooms that used to be dressing room of the stars.</span> <span id="s1276">Like, we were in a room that used to be dressing room from Italian actress Alida Valli, I don’t know if you ever heard of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Her -- see, I don’t know her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Okay, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: -- but I know it was great film --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: -- studio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: -- so we were -- and we had the running water in the bathroom, and all of that.</span> <span id="s1283">And then I hooked up with Evie’s brother and Heinz Winkler.</span> <span id="s1284">That was the brother-in-law of Kelmer -- Kelmer and Mary Winkler’s dau -- really, Winkler’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: And they become a little clique in the camp, and I thought that I had died and went to heaven, I love it.</span> <span id="s1287">Four -- five Austrian Heinz’s, and me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: And you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yeah, I fell in this group.</span> <span id="s1290">So it was four -- I couldn’t speak German, except a little that I pick up at home.</span> <span id="s1291">But those guys was constantly blabbering in -- in German, so I was forced to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1292">So we decide, look, we got these [indecipherable] Jews for the camp, at least 20 percent of that which -- let’s organize Jewish community center.</span> <span id="s1293">Hell, the Americans have their [indecipherable] and on their own the Jewish community center is getting all kind of goods from America.</span> <span id="s1294">So we go over there to Jewish community [indecipherable] says, my name is Moishka Pinsel, we would like to make a Jewish community center in the camp at Cinecitta, what can you do for us?</span> <span id="s1295">Says, well you bring us the membership, give us the name all the kids you have, and then come once a week, [indecipherable] the chocolate, and the candy, and all information you need.</span> <span id="s1296">Said, but you got to have some kind of orth -- organization.</span> <span id="s1297">Here -- go back in the camps, so I tell every brother, okay, you are going to be vice-president, you are going to be treasurer, so m-make a little legitimate thing.</span> <span id="s1298">We go Italian print shop, and we go to Italian haberdashery shop.</span> <span id="s1299">We gather those -- you know, like American hats what the soldier wear?</span> <span id="s1300">With a big Magen-David with a green background, and we become a -- Jewish boys [indecipherable] Cinecitta.</span> <span id="s1301">Come for the [indecipherable] Jewish -- the own special bridge, we create it.</span> <span id="s1302">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: From -- from this small group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: From -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: And you didn’t -- you didn’t include other kids, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Oh, you did.</span> <span id="s1308">I mean, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: We were just the managing, see, because we are on permanent stock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: The rest of kids were coming and going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: So they have to have a nucleus who is running the thing.</span> <span id="s1314">And we came here with a room for meetings.</span> <span id="s1315">And we had the minutes for the meetings, because Americans are not stupid, they wanted the minutes from the meeting before they give us chocolate.</span> <span id="s1316">But first time that we got chocolate, give us so much chocolate I tell to Winkler, my friend that’s still live in Kansas City, said, “Listen Heinrich, we got only 32 kids, Americans give us like 100 box.</span> <span id="s1317">Let’s sell them back and make money [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: So you sold them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1320">We still had the -- more than we need.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Where did you -- where did you money to do these hats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: From the stuff that we sold.</span> <span id="s1323">From the stuff that we sold, we got so much overflow of the goods that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: From this chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: From the ya --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: You had extra money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: -- chocolate and the candies, all the kind of stuff they give us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: And who did you sell it to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: On the black market, piazza redi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: You sold it on the black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Piazza Vittorio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1334">Right wi -- piazza Vittorio.</span> <span id="s1335">You could sell anything piazza Vittorio.</span> <span id="s1336">Not then, even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Did your parents know that you were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: My parents didn’t know damn thing except Evie’s brother know, Winkler know, I know, and children, because we have to finally [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1339">We were thinking to charge a membership.</span> <span id="s1340">But how can you charge a membership to the kids who might be three days in the camp, or might be three weeks in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: So we have to have a source of income.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: We didn’t have our own sources to go [indecipherable] with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: So we had to come figure it out to finag [indecipherable] -- w-we did what American army does for last hundred years.</span> <span id="s1347">You know, I learned that when I was drafted.</span> <span id="s1348">I mean that, I was in a -- a quartermaster.</span> <span id="s1349">I would take a hundred pair of tee shirts, I will go to the motor pool and I will say, listen, I need the Jeep, I need this, I need that.</span> <span id="s1350">I didn’t steal, I didn’t get a dime.</span> <span id="s1351">But I changed the services [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1352">I went to the kitchen in Tokyo and I told the chief cook, I said, you know what, I would like to come -- when I come from Tokyo, a little t-bone steak, I would like it when I come at two o’clock in the morning, kitchen is working all night, I don’t want that you give me hard feelings.</span> <span id="s1353">But you will never have to make application for the white paints and the shirts, anything.</span> <span id="s1354">You come to me, I take care of it.</span> <span id="s1355">I’ll bypass the slips altogether.</span> <span id="s1356">And that worked for me for year and a half in Tokyo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: So it’s a lot of bartering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: It’s wa -- oh, everything is bargaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: A matter of fact, when it was time for me to come back to United States, and that’s called return to Z.I.</span> <span id="s1361">You know what’s a Z.I.?</span> <span id="s1362">Zone of Interior.</span> <span id="s1363">And I say damn it, I went to Japan and Korea in the ship, I don’t want to do that again.</span> <span id="s1364">The army transport ship, you sleeping in the cots eight high, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s1365">And I was stupid that I was figure I don’t want to crawl up there, I was going to be the bottom [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1366">And the sergeant who was on top told me son, crawl as high as you can.</span> <span id="s1367">So I’m not going crazy.</span> <span id="s1368">He says, you’ll be sorry.</span> <span id="s1369">Yeah, I was sorry, because everybody who got sick he would cough right down below you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: So I learned, so I said I’m not going to go through this.</span> <span id="s1372">So when I had to take a medical examination to return back I said to my doctor, what can you do for me to send me back by air?</span> <span id="s1373">Said, ah, that’s if you’re sick, wounded, high ranking officer.</span> <span id="s1374">So, you know sir, I know you buy your uniform.</span> <span id="s1375">How would you like to have a three pair of headquarters -- I mean lowquarter shoes, a couple of pair of boots, some underwear, and I gave you a uniform to put me on the air.</span> <span id="s1376">Says how can you do it?</span> <span id="s1377">I says, you put me on the air and you’ll see.</span> <span id="s1378">He says, you have a deal.</span> <span id="s1379">So he wrote a paper that severe motors -- motion sickness, that I got deathly sick.</span> <span id="s1380">So -- but I didn’t trust that son of a gun, so I brought him all the left shoes, and I brought him pants but no jackets.</span> <span id="s1381">And I brought him shorts, but no tee-shirts.</span> <span id="s1382">When I saw my name on the order that I’m going to States by air, I gave him the rest of it.</span> <span id="s1383">And I flew.</span> <span id="s1384">I fl -- descended back the air.</span> <span id="s1385">I was so excited that I was in 24 hours in California.</span> <span id="s1386">Now, he put the manifest that I’m very si -- problem with sickness.</span> <span id="s1387">He said, be sure when you arrive San Francisco, ambulance be there for you, so you better be very sick.</span> <span id="s1388">So I was there, and they sure pick me up with the orders [indecipherable], but when we stopped next to a telephone booth, I couldn’t resist to jump to call home that I’m back in States.</span> <span id="s1389">They caught me.</span> <span id="s1390">No plane back to Kansas City.</span> <span id="s1391">Boot camp to Camp Carson, Colorado peeling potatoes for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Do you got -- End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Zdenko, when you were in Modena, when you went to Italy, did you have to have a change of name?</span> <span id="s1396">Did you chan --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: We do -- we do -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: You had no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: No, I had a -- I went to Italy with Zdenko Bergl, my father, none of the family changed his name.</span> <span id="s1400">We had a false name later at a certain point when we went in the hiding, when we got the matter of our false paper which were issued to us during the German occupation of Italy, then I become Luigi Bianchi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: And was that in Florence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: No, when we -- when we had to run from Modena, you know, from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: -- Andreoli-Mitrani --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: -- they figure out that she has to give us some kind of paper if we get stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: So -- so we, again, through the ecclesiastic help, the same channels they use before, same pipeline, they gave us documents that -- the Italian identity card that I have a photocopy it here.</span> <span id="s1409">That I become Luigi Bianchi, my mother become Maria Bianchi, and my father become Georgio Bianchi.</span> <span id="s1410">And they gave us birth benevento, which is southern Italy already in American hands.</span> <span id="s1411">So if they wanted to find out if is true or not, they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1412">So they had the foresight when issuing the false paper, that they’re issuing for a province there is no way the Nazi or Fascist could check it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1414">But not -- not -- so this is when you were moving from Modena to Florence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Before -- before we went to Florence --</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: -- they give us like overnight those funny paper --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: -- if -- case we get stop on the way to hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: To have something I.D., because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: -- in Italy at that time, every two steps somebody ask you for I.D.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: So we didn’t want to press our luck to go, you know, a-around just for a walk.</span> <span id="s1426">We just needed to go from point A to point B, in case you get stopped you have some kind of paper.</span> <span id="s1427">And those paper were issued to us on the way to Florence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Now, did you keep those papers when you were in Florence so you -- so in case --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: I keep these paper -- no, I kept them in Florence, I kept them to -- to this day, til I turn it over to the institute in Washington.</span> <span id="s1430">They kept the original, they send me the photocopy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1432">So you could use it at any time, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: They did do -- if he would need it we could use it any time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Wethi -- done quite well.</span> <span id="s1438">I mean, they were -- it was done in a m-monastery, I don’t know which one exactly, above Florence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: And they did a hell of a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: But when you were in Modena, you didn’t need anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: In Modena.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: In Modena, rather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: All right, in Modena I didn’t have any paper, because we were it -- Italian power, Fascist government was in force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Right, and it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: And they didn’t ask me, we’re just who we were, we were Jewish refugee from Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: And it was no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: So it was no problem, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1449">Til -- til -- til the moment that the Germany took Italy over, we didn’t have no problem at all.</span> <span id="s1450">We could move more -- more than you -- more than you can even imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: So you were outside playing, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: I was with the kids playing, my father was going dealing with the farmer, we’re going to bicycle to neighboring town.</span> <span id="s1453">Nobody ask anything.</span> <span id="s1454">A matter of fact, when -- I’m going to go take you back, I suppose you know a little bit about opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: You familiar name Benjamino Gigli?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: When Gigli come to sing, I think, in “Madame Butterfly” in neighboring town -- I mean, the -- we went to see hi -- to listen to him.</span> <span id="s1459">I mean, you know, in Italian it’s a big faux pas to say see him, you don’t see opera --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: -- you listen to opera.</span> <span id="s1462">So we went to listen to him -- we went to ask can we go and listen to him, he says, what do you mean if you -- give a permission?</span> <span id="s1463">It’s a law that you got to listen to Benjamino.</span> <span id="s1464">They were so proud of him.</span> <span id="s1465">So we really had a -- you know, when -- when I think at the same period the Jews were dying in these concentration camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: -- it was obscene how free we were.</span> <span id="s1468">And we felt free.</span> <span id="s1469">We never worried one single second til Mussolini was in power, for us.</span> <span id="s1470">And I’m quoting in power himself, because once the Italian government failed, and the new republic si -- si -- Repubblica Sociale Italiana, become in formation and Hitler arrested the member of Grand Consiglio, those are the people that voted Mussolini out of power, arrested all of them.</span> <span id="s1471">In between him was -- between them -- I’m trying to ration myself, so I better slow down.</span> <span id="s1472">Between them was Galeaggo Cino, which was his -- Mussolini’s son-in-law, which was married to Edda Mussolini, ex-Italian ambassador in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1473">Hitler hated his guts because every time come back from Berlin and told Mussolini, his father-in-law, “Dad, German don’t know I speak fluent German.</span> <span id="s1474">They think you are idiot.</span> <span id="s1475">They think you are a patsy, they have no respect for you.”</span> <span id="s1476">And Hitler wrote that he reported that to Mussolini, because Mussolini told Hitler, you know, I -- you think I’m such a joke because I got information.</span> <span id="s1477">So didn’t take Nazi very long to put together that the only person present when they were making fun of him was Galeaggo Cino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: So when Italy capitulated they managed to arrest all the member.</span> <span id="s1480">Mussolini got nothing, Galeaggo Cino was shot in Verona with the rest of the member of the Grand Consiglio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: And when Edda went to her father and told him listen dad, you [indecipherable] I don’t want to ever know about you.</span> <span id="s1483">Mussolini told Edda, my dear, I have nothing to say.</span> <span id="s1484">And Edda didn’t believe him.</span> <span id="s1485">And when Mussolini was on the run, Edda could saved him with partisans, but she didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Because when they caught Mussolini on the run in Como, in Swiss border, the partisan got ahold of Edda, and says, who?</span> <span id="s1488">She told him she will never forgive him and she never did, til she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Cause she thought she had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yeah, now i -- i -- but a little interesting background because we are going ho -- more -- more in depth than my own pis -- personal biography, that Mussolini could have been saved, see, when -- when Cardinal Montini -- was Cardinal Milan at that time, later become Pope, he told Duce don’t leave anyplace, American be here in three days.</span> <span id="s1491">His entourage, that was loaded with the gold and jewelry, they were -- they were in hurry to cross the border and go to Switzerland because they figured that’s the only way they can take booty across.</span> <span id="s1492">And they figure if you have a Mussolini with that, you have a sure way to pass the border.</span> <span id="s1493">Well, they didn’t, because at Zongo they caught him and all of them.</span> <span id="s1494">But when -- Montini told him three times, Duce, don’t leave.</span> <span id="s1495">And I have a personal feeling if he would not run by American, Il Duce would be alive til he died a natural death, because mis -- America would never kill him.</span> <span id="s1496">But we felt very safe until Mussolini -- the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: We ne -- we never worry a single second.</span> <span id="s1499">[indecipherable] lots anti-Semitic law, he will -- he write the story what happen in Italy, and there were unpleasant things, especially for Italian Jews, they become sort of -- Italian Jew resented Mussolini more than us, because Italian Jews helped him get in power, so they become very resentful.</span> <span id="s1500">We look at from different perspective.</span> <span id="s1501">We look to our savior.</span> <span id="s1502">And they look at him and feel we were wealthy and prosperous, he took it away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: So it was nothing, you know, cutting -- you know, it wasn’t simple solution.</span> <span id="s1505">It was a much more complicated than appear in the surface.</span> <span id="s1506">But that’s -- y -- that’s -- about this period that’s all I got to say, except if you got any questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Where did you -- you had your Bar Mitzvah in ma -- Modena?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: I had the Bar Mitzvah in -- in -- i-in Yugoslavia, in Sucha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: In -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: That were part of the territory occupied by Italia, not annexed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: The -- the first place that we run across, and was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Had you been studying for your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: No, no, nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: So -- so what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: It -- it was kind of winged under -- like a underground Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Did you do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: You didn’t have no Torah, you didn’t read, you didn’t make a speech.</span> <span id="s1519">My dear mother and father, my uncle and all this the American kids do, it was nobody there.</span> <span id="s1520">We were three poor Jews on the run.</span> <span id="s1521">So th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: So there was no rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: No -- n-no, it was no rabbi.</span> <span id="s1524">It was a cantor that we went to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: That he was in the hiding also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1528">So it wasn’t a real thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: No, no, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: -- the best we can d-do on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: -- circumstances.</span> <span id="s1534">You know, if you will go get a bunch together Jews to go ahead, to try to perform a ceremony, it be just like going a open trap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1536">Especially where you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: So it was not -- it was not feasible, it was not possible.</span> <span id="s1538">Now if that was -- if I had the Bar Mitzvah in Ljubljana, yes, it c -- we could have pulled it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: You could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Oh yeah, plenty Jews in Ljubljana.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: In Modena were there other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: In mo -- in province of Modena, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: P-Province of Modena had approximately 250 Jewish families spread out.</span> <span id="s1545">We -- some of them from Croatia --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: -- some of them Austrian.</span> <span id="s1548">Lots of them I never had the chance to meet, but yes, we do, because i-Italian -- once i-i -- once Italian Jew government accepted Jews to come across, they didn’t send them no more in deep south.</span> <span id="s1549">Deep south, was only camping for a month there because Mussolini wanted to go ahead and show Hitler that he put the Jews in a difficult position, which was not difficult position.</span> <span id="s1550">For a month it was in very unpleasant climate, but if Italian could survive there, I mean, Jews can survive also.</span> <span id="s1551">But they put them there in the boot of Italy, clear in the bottom.</span> <span id="s1552">But the rest of the Jews I would say nobody went souther than Naples.</span> <span id="s1553">I mean in confinement by Italian government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Mm-hm, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: I remember in -- when my Aunt original -- Ruza and Pawel, they were sent to Rovigo, province of Rovigo, which is close to Padowa, and we were sent to Modena.</span> <span id="s1556">And then we decided, why should the sister be separated?</span> <span id="s1557">L-Listen to this, is less conceivable.</span> <span id="s1558">So we go ahead and write to Rome, and say listen, my name is so and so, we appreciate very much for your help, but my sister is in province Rovigo, is only hundred miles from here, why we cannot live in the same town?</span> <span id="s1559">There no problem.</span> <span id="s1560">S-Send the paper to Ruza, move over there to Modena with your sister.</span> <span id="s1561">I mean, is incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Resume --</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Now, when you’re in Modena, when it’s -- it’s 1942 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: ’43 now.</span> <span id="s1566">You talking armistice.</span> <span id="s1567">Ru -- my Ruza arrived there in ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: No, it’s -- ’42, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Before -- it’s before the armistice --</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: -- because you moved to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1574">We were already in Modena about six, seven months --</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: -- then we asked to join us and then we spend additional eight, nine months together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1578">Are you hearing what’s going on in Europe?</span> <span id="s1579">Are you hearing about death camps or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Not only that we -- we heard Italian propaganda because Italian press and Italian radio had every hour bulletin.</span> <span id="s1581">And one thing I like about Italian, Italian would never have a bulletin that says American troops advance and we lost the Sicily.</span> <span id="s1582">Italian rado -- radio would say something, according to our established the plans of defense, we moved our defense troop on the other side of Straits of Messina.</span> <span id="s1583">On the other side of -- that mean that Sicily is gone, if they moved the troops on the side of Straits Messina, if you know geography.</span> <span id="s1584">In -- or if, like for example when they lost Bali, it says in Italian, [speaks Italian here].</span> <span id="s1585">We retire -- we retreated according previously established plan.</span> <span id="s1586">Baloney.</span> <span id="s1587">They were after -- Mark Clark was after them til Naples, going like wildfire, then it stop.</span> <span id="s1588">From Naples on to Rome took him five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: Because you had the Monte

id="s1594">And Anzio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Which is right next to Rome.</span> <span id="s1597">And they were defending Rome.</span> <span id="s1598">That’s why -- and they were sitting in Florence with us listening to radio London three times a day in this apartment from this Fascist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: But that’s in Florence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: So, in Modena, what do you know about what’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: We don’t know

that money that we that we could go ahead, all -- we got him -- we give him a receipt, they give us this cash.</span> <span id="s1605">And they know that my uncle was already in Switzerland, so that sh -- they not worry eventually if they catch us, that he might honor our promissory loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: And on base of that they give us the money, but they didn’t have n-nothing guaranteed, you know, there’s -- there’s all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: -- a promise in the sky.</span> <span id="s1610">But they were more interested helping us than worry for this money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: And they give you 50,000 lira?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: 50,000 lira that would be money today about 12,000 bucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: 10,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: 1200

and that was 1943, so minimum wage in America was probably 35 cents.</span> <span id="s1623">So it was lots of money, but they had the money, and they were not worried.</span> <span id="s1624">Now, while we are hiding in Florence, they brought us food lots of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1627">But the ham, the

we didn’t worry about toilet because the apartment was in the middle of the building --</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: -- and that was on the east side of the building, it’s over the courtyard.</span> <span id="s1648">So we didn’t have any tenant next door to us on left or right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: You understand?</span> <span id="s1651">So th-that were not -- we could not talk loud, we could not -- oh, there’s something, you talking about if I was spoiled.</span> <span id="s1652">I know they

next to that park is a railroad tracks, but which are really actually hi-hidden by the cypress trees, so you could not see the track or the train.</span> <span id="s1672">The German put a boxcar there, and waited for the sonderais to go ahead and pick a bunch of forced labor of solely Italian guys, to send them to Germany for labor camp because they were running short of labor force.</span> <span id="s1673">But thin -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: -- the military was 15 - 16 years old, German.</span> <span id="s1676">So they came over

you are young, so probably you will get away.</span> <span id="s1679">I’m going to jump over the fence before everybody goes ahead to over there, and he disappeared.</span> <span id="s1680">And he says I’m sure they will leave you alone.</span> <span id="s1681">But I was not sure because I was pretty good size boy.</span> <span id="s1682">But I saw the exit next to me, a woman, when she was -- while the German was talking to her, and she went to the German off the [indecipherable] and the guy just kick her in her ass and pushed her out of the line.</span> <span id="s1683">So when my turn come up, I turn to the German, he ask me what’s your name, blah, blah, I say eh-eh-eh, he let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: So you were acting as if you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: If I -- I would never think of it if I didn’t see the woman who -- at the other exit.</span> <span id="s1686">And -- and that’s -- after that I never left the apartment til liberation.</span> <span id="s1687">Tha -- so -- so scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: And you’re just so scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: Very close call.</span> <span id="s1690">Not

bring it -- deliver a supply like for a whole week.</span> <span id="s1705">But not to house.</span> <span id="s1706">We -- that we didn’t want to do or show anybody.</span> <span id="s1707">It was always a meeting place where the guy had the stuff and other people came.</span> <span id="s1708">This he trusted, because he was afraid the authority will know that selling on black market without

<p><span id="s1721">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1722">Did you miss not being in Croatia, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: I never missed Croatia to this day.</span> <span id="s1724">When I go back home, and my friends which are, by the way, very good to me when I come in, they very [indecipherable] or -- oriented, like a big Croat, not anti-Semitic, but in spite being my friend, and really

Zagreb, I have to go to Milan catch flight.</span> <span id="s1726">It was a very bad connection with the train, you have to change two trains, you have to go two o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1727">He says, what’s your problem?</span> <span id="s1728">He drove me from his apartment in Zagreb to the airport in Milan.</span> <span id="s1729">Very few people do favors like this.</span> <span id="s1730">Never thought of a single second, said what’s the big deal?</span> <span id="s1731">I’ll drive you to the airport.</span> <span id="s1732">And he did.</span> <span id="s1733">And many other reasons.</span> <span id="s1734">Whenever I come I stay in his house, and you have this [indecipherable] atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A:

farmers and for the big market once a month, he had a excess supply.</span> <span id="s1739">Woman used to come buy the shoes, they were high shoes with laces, wi -- were selling, and he was quite well to do.</span> <span id="s1740">And no bank in Zabno.</span> <span id="s1741">So for any business dealing with -- need the extra money -- my father, like you would need 50,000 diner, or -- or -- or 100,000 diner, or -- or -- or -- or his neighbor, who was a shoemaker have to pay for leather, finish leather and sole leather --</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span

[indecipherable] and went to [indecipherable] for years.</span> <span id="s1745">He just went ahead, cause all -- if he had the cash, he give it to you.</span> <span id="s1746">Nobody would dream [indecipherable] give you money.</span> <span id="s1747">And we went til the -- til we had to go, that -- that we had to leave.</span> <span id="s1748">And -- and we were always very friends and --

and didn’t come back to Yugoslavia til the -- Tito made him.</span> <span id="s1755">Tito told him, I extended your visa so many times.</span> <span id="s1756">Now -- or you come back to Yugoslavia, or I’m not going -- take away your citizenship, then you cannot come at all.</span> <span id="s1757">Being that you have a family, come back.</span> <span id="s1758">Why do you think -- they show you how Communist government in itself is stupid, instead of using this expre -- expert surgeon in the hospital in Zagreb, they put him behind the desk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1760">So -- so why wouldn’t you have missed all of this when you were in Italy?</span> <span id="s1761">Is it because you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: -- I asked you whether you missed it, because you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: -- I didn’t miss it because all I remember is the -- my childhood what I have.</span> <span id="s1765">And I was growing.</span> <span id="s1766">I outgrew my child day -- I was become in Italy a young -- my puberty reached me.</span> <span id="s1767">I discovered girls.</span> <span id="s1768">And in Italy you had all kind of girls.</span> <span id="s1769">It was completely different [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1770">I come from a little nothing town in Croatia, Sv.</span> <span id="s1771">Ivan Zabno, end up living in Rome.</span> <span id="s1772">I’m going from Modena to Florence and now in Rome.</span> <span id="s1773">Now just imagine -- now this is one of the most sophisticate city in Europe.</span> <span id="s1774">Is nothing that was not available in Rome, especially for us that we have a -- under umbrella of American occupation.</span> <span id="s1775">I mean, we took American phony I.D.s, and we went to the streetcar, and the guys that ticket, you schlop in the -- the guy didn’t know what the hell I have.</span> <span id="s1776">I di -- refugee camp I.D. cards.</span> <span id="s1777">I didn’t have an I.D..</span> <span id="s1778">I used to ride on the train with the refugee I.D. card, because that was a-after one -- years.</span> <span id="s1779">Is very difficult for somebody who didn’t live in this period to -- the concept what was happen.</span> <span id="s1780">Once Italian government normalize and took over, this picnic was over.</span> <span id="s1781">But the life in Cinecitta didn’t change for next three, four years.</span> <span id="s1782">You know, the refugees were going back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Then let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1784">You -- your -- your parents, in some ways, lose much more than you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: By leaving Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Are they depressed by th -- I mean, do you notice that they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Okay, okay, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: -- that -- that they’re different than you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Okay, n-now let’s go to Cinecitta liberation, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Well I’m sort of -- I’m interested both in the -- in -- cause Cinecitta already, everybody knows you’re safe, now you don’t know what’s happened to your family yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Corre -- we -- we -- when the war -- the minute war was over --</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: -- we know who was survive, who didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1796">We know the uncle in Wisplete married to Genta was gone.</span> <span id="s1797">The minute we hit Rome.</span> <span id="s1798">We didn’t know it yet in Florence, okay?</span> <span id="s1799">But in Rome, in matter of few days, we know who survived the war.</span> <span id="s1800">What we didn’t know, if we can go ahead and return home, or when, because of Communist regime in -- in -- in croa -- in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: The people took everything over.</span> <span id="s1803">So really, they still didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s1804">First the Nazi took over, now the commie take it over.</span> <span id="s1805">Now, you want me to take off from this point?</span> <span id="s1806">My father realized from the minute that we have to run, already in 1941 that it’s very unlikely we going to see anything for a long time, maybe never.</span> <span id="s1807">So he made the peace of mind.</span> <span id="s1808">He were depressed, yes, he know he had to start again, but the other hand, when my father was fighting for Austro [indecipherable] empire, he had his own business, which he lost it, because when Austria lost the war, he was on the other side of the border, he did come out barehanded.</span> <span id="s1809">That’s why he had to work again.</span> <span id="s1810">He was in own -- own business.</span> <span id="s1811">So that was second time he lost everything.</span> <span id="s1812">So he -- that was like a repetition of the history.</span> <span id="s1813">Each war costed them everything they accomplished.</span> <span id="s1814">At that time Dad was not young any more, he was already 45 - 50 years old.</span> <span id="s1815">So the -- what -- beyond -- my father was very -- he always believe in real estate, so he went -- i-it didn’t upset him very much.</span> <span id="s1816">It upset my mother much more than upset my father.</span> <span id="s1817">Now, w-while we in Cinecitta, the yugo -- Tito send his emissary to the camp to make a speech to all the Yugoslav refugees that it’s time to returning home.</span> <span id="s1818">A-And they invited all to a hall, and they went to look for everybody who come from Yugoslavia, and told them the war is over, now you got a free country, it’s time to come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: No -- th -- from my father went to the guy who was a colonel with a big, red star, and the -- all this red leather as I remember like today, and he told him, “Druze, Kamarade Bergl, it is your duty to return home.”</span> <span id="s1821">And my father tell him, “Druze, Kamarade, what you going to give me back?”</span> <span id="s1822">He said, “Don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s1823">He said, “You come back, you will work.”</span> <span id="s1824">He said, “Druze, I didn’t ask you if I will work.</span> <span id="s1825">I ask you what will you give me back.”</span> <span id="s1826">“Everybody got the same thing.”</span> <span id="s1827">“I didn’t ask you what everybody got.</span> <span id="s1828">Will you give me my property back?”</span> <span id="s1829">“Don’t worry, you will work in your property.”</span> <span id="s1830">“Again you avoiding my answer.”</span> <span id="s1831">He says, “Don’t worry, we going to come pick you up next week, you all go back home, you’ll be very happy.”</span> <span id="s1832">Well my father told him screw it, I’m not going to go ahead and deal with this stuff.</span> <span id="s1833">And when they come next week to pick up people who are willing to go, my father didn’t show up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: So he send his goons with the red star, couple of soldier that he had on the truck, to look for my dad.</span> <span id="s1836">So it’s -- my dad come over there, and he tell him, “Why come you’re not ready to go?”</span> <span id="s1837">He says, “Well, first of all -- first of all, Nazis took everything from me, now you took everything from me.</span> <span id="s1838">To go back to what?</span> <span id="s1839">That you employ me in my own factory?</span> <span id="s1840">I -- I got a better future, I -- I’m not going to do that.”</span> <span id="s1841">And he says, we come -- the Commie ca -- tell him, “Comrade Bergl, you see this star?</span> <span id="s1842">You see decoration?”</span> <span id="s1843">Say, “I fought for your freedom.”</span> <span id="s1844">And my father say to him, “Mr. Colonel, I got to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1845">When I fought for your freedom as Austro-Hungarian soldier, you were not even a vision in your father’s eye.</span> <span id="s1846">So don’t tell me what will fight for freedom.”</span> <span id="s1847">I said oh my God, we’ll never go back home.</span> <span id="s1848">But you know, if you go back to Yugoslavia, they will arrest you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: That was the end of any possibility us returning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: That when we apply for immigration to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1854">We need to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: When this comrade guy from Croatia --</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: -- is trying to convince your father to go back, and he refuses to go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: -- what year are we talking about now?</span> <span id="s1862">Is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: I can’t tell you exactly, we come in the camp in 1945, this happened about end of 1946, beginning of ’47, but I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s1864">We left the camp in ’47 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: -- but as we -- chronologically you advance, I will bring it to this point, but I think this -- this happened shortly before we left the camp, because at this point we realize that we are not going back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: And we saw the ca -- Cinecitta was not solution, and I was now behind i-in my schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: I -- I was going to ask you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: Okay, now can -- can we go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: The first year that I arrive in camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: -- that was the August of 1944.</span> <span id="s1875">By December of 1940 minister Italian of education pass a special ruling with all the refugees who couldn’t be going to school, or were forbidden going to school, they can make exam no matter what level they finish when the war started, three years at the time.</span> <span id="s1876">Then my father hire some tutoring for Italian and some other subject, chemistry.</span> <span id="s1877">But math, languages, history, geography, Ruza husband tutor me for my exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Hm, Pawel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1880">He’s -- he’s tutor me, a f -- and Winkler, the friend that’s still in Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: He tutor us both for these subjects.</span> <span id="s1883">And -- and the exam was to be taken not in Rome, but in Castel Gandolfo, this is some -- a residential [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Cinecitta was much closer to Castel Gandolfo than downtown Rome.</span> <span id="s1886">So when the man -- when ministry assign us for this exam, they send us to Castel Gandolfo, and there where I took my three years of my junior high, and then six months later I took what it takes to go f -- three additional years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: And you passed all those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Yeah, it was very tough, it was very iffy because it was lots of cramming to do, and when you c -- study so intensely for a short period of time -- and oh, forgot most important part, Ruza husband tutor me in Latin, mandatory in Italy.</span> <span id="s1889">Latin, oh, you had to take it first three years of junior high you had to -- you had so much Latin you think you want to be a priest or a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1890">Because in Italy, in Europe, til 20 years ago, every prescription was in Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: It’s not like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: You had never studied Latin before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Never, never, so Ruza probably -- he -- he was such a fantastic innovator, that to realize that these young guys, to -- to go [speaks Latin here], you know, it’s a verb.</span> <span id="s1895">That’s very hard to cram all that you need.</span> <span id="s1896">So he improvise kind of off color stories in Latin that he made us translate in Italian because he know that will sink in.</span> <span id="s1897">Like he would say the -- I cannot tell you on camera, but it was very funny story.</span> <span id="s1898">Like, he gallo -- this is not off-color by the way, he [speaks Latin here].</span> <span id="s1899">Here is the rooster sitting on a tree and saying cuckoo-re-koo.</span> <span id="s1900">But then he come -- that’s how we started, then to get us more interested, he come to more color and it worked, because we come intrigued, you know, what the hell it means, and -- and we managed to squeeze in -- in my examina -- then when we left the camp in 1947, after three years of Cinecitta, and my father said look, now you have to decide to do, and where you want to go to school.</span> <span id="s1901">So my father left, he made a couple of trips to northern Italy, to figure out where we want to stay and live in Italy, and he come up with Lake Como.</span> <span id="s1902">He said was not the big city like Milano, is not the big cit -- Rome.</span> <span id="s1903">The life [indecipherable] is happy go lucky, beautiful surroundings, sweet [indecipherable] next door.</span> <span id="s1904">So we went over there, and I enrolled in architectural college [indecipherable] in Como.</span> <span id="s1905">And that’s when I started studying, and I went -- I was short one year when our paper come because I was trying to catch as much extra credit as I could, because I know sooner or later you come for America.</span> <span id="s1906">But I didn’t manage to do them all, because I was short, I think, about four or five hour of credit.</span> <span id="s1907">And when we ask postponement for one year, American embassy told us we can postpone, but you go in the bottom of the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: And my father would not go to bottom of the list.</span> <span id="s1910">And I was looking forward to go to the bottom of the list.</span> <span id="s1911">I was not in hurry to go to America.</span> <span id="s1912">A matter of fact, I told my father, you know, you -- I’m not going to States.</span> <span id="s1913">And my father said, “You know, I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1914">First of all, I want you to know you’re in Italy.</span> <span id="s1915">In Italy, til 21, I’m running the show.</span> <span id="s1916">If I have to go to Italian police to put you on the boat in Naples, I will do it.</span> <span id="s1917">So don’t make a mistake.”</span> <span id="s1918">And I know he would have done it.</span> <span id="s1919">So I finally give in, and -- and then we went to the Camp Obanioli when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Why didn’t you want to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Because this concept of a Euforia, and a l-land of milk of honey, it was baloney.</span> <span id="s1922">I know that America established with the hard work.</span> <span id="s1923">It was not such a thing as free lunch.</span> <span id="s1924">I was smart enough, I was not -- I didn’t have a mental delusion.</span> <span id="s1925">I was looking for what it is.</span> <span id="s1926">Here I was -- my father was working his rear end to go ahead and send me to school, my only preoccupation was to make a decent grade, which I tried to do a little bit by studying, but a lot by cheating.</span> <span id="s1927">And I become a expert -- if I would study so hard as I study how to cheat to pass a test, I’d be a genius.</span> <span id="s1928">Innovation that you -- is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1929">I don’t know if that interested you, but I want to tell you, the -- my math -- can I imagine I’m studying architectural engineering, I’m trying to cheat on math.</span> <span id="s1930">I mean to tell you, it’s mind boggling.</span> <span id="s1931">But my professor of math, he liked me a lot.</span> <span id="s1932">He took such a personal interest in me, that if I would ditch classes, he would take a Como paper and see what movie I’d be hiding, and actually after classes, he would come in the movie, dig me out and give me a big speech, aren’t you ashamed, your father is working on the bicycle selling the soap from one little town to the other so you can go to the school, and -- and he flunked me.</span> <span id="s1933">And he tutor me the whole summer for free.</span> <span id="s1934">You cannot be engineer if you don’t know the math.</span> <span id="s1935">Til the last test.</span> <span id="s1936">Now, we already know we have to leave for America, so we figure out I’m going to get at least the paper in order so I can continue in the States to get my degree.</span> <span id="s1937">And I know I can never do it, because I know it would be a very difficult test.</span> <span id="s1938">So the friend of mine who was really [indecipherable] in math, and we had at the same time a German test, so he was Italian guy who di -- his father had a visual optical audio store.</span> <span id="s1939">So I told you what -- tell you what I do.</span> <span id="s1940">You help me to get me two hearing aids, and I will help you with the German test.</span> <span id="s1941">So he brought me bunch of wire, I sit in the last row and I run a wire through my sleeve, through the steam pipe down in the basement, and I had a little mike in my hand, and my fa -- my friend down in the boiler room.</span> <span id="s1942">So as soon as he wrote the -- our test on the blackboard, I wrote it -- you know, I -- I -- whispered to my friend down in the boiler room, it took him exactly 10 minutes to develop the test.</span> <span id="s1943">And I was so delighted that I copied it, now is a problem to get out of this gizmo that I got.</span> <span id="s1944">So I took a knife, I cut the wire -- because I was wired clear down to the basement, and once you go ahead and -- and I was so excited that I send my -- instead of hanging to the paper and breaking my head, blah, blah, blah, I turn it to him.</span> <span id="s1945">And then my pr -- my fres -- my professor, and he looked at me, he says, “Zdenko, are you sure you’re done?”</span> <span id="s1946">I said, “Yeah I’m done.”</span> <span id="s1947">He se -- he let me go.</span> <span id="s1948">Rest of them took additional hours.</span> <span id="s1949">Now ca -- we come back to the class and he says, “You know, guys, I’m embarrassed.</span> <span id="s1950">You took one hour, two hours, here Mr. Bergl, 45 minutes.</span> <span id="s1951">Now Mr. Bergl is a smart guy, he’s going to come to the blackboard and show us how he done it.”</span> <span id="s1952">That’s the end of the show.</span> <span id="s1953">Flunked me.</span> <span id="s1954">There were made a -- make up exam in September, and one month later, was November we were on the way for America.</span> <span id="s1955">But he -- he helped me enough to pass the test.</span> <span id="s1956">Now fast forward 25 years later, I’m coming to Como.</span> <span id="s1957">I invite my professor for lunch with my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s1958">Meet my wife.</span> <span id="s1959">And my professor tell me, he says, “Zdenko, I’m teaching there for 45 years, I know the kids cheat.</span> <span id="s1960">Please, how did you do it?”</span> <span id="s1961">And then I told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: 25 years later he waited to tell him how I cheated.</span> <span id="s1964">Now I come to the States, I couldn’t start right away back to the school because I couldn’t speak English, not one word.</span> <span id="s1965">I enroll in the engli -- English classes through the Jewish social services, and then the army came, and my both -- both folks got sick, my mother and father, and they got the co -- help through the Red Cross, with the commitment that when I come up from service we will pay it back.</span> <span id="s1966">So when I come back, forget about the school, I had to go work because I had about -- in 1943, I had the 5,000 dollar worth of debt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: So I had to go back to work, and I -- I had to choose a profession, because I didn’t want to go have to work some manual labor or something.</span> <span id="s1969">So somebody suggests why don’t you go in some high technical field that is growing, heating and cooling.</span> <span id="s1970">And then I went, join the labor union, and went on apprenticeship program, and I made a good living doing this, was very happy with it.</span> <span id="s1971">And I never turn back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: The school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: -- the school because it took me too long -- now I was already 26 years old, so I wasn’t about to go he -- back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: But I suppose in some ways we’re all lucky that you didn’t go back to school with all your cheating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: Well, to me -- to -- to -- the fact it is that I was clever enough that I realized that you want to become a good -- you had to have a -- be good with the math.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: And I realized that I will never be good in math.</span> <span id="s1978">I will do -- be good in lots of things, but math is not my thing.</span> <span id="s1979">So I said why should I be a bad architect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: You know, because there’s no future in it.</span> <span id="s1982">But they should give you one funny thing -- in the same school that I went in Como, I met lots of guys til the day that I had to depart for America.</span> <span id="s1983">Eight months ago I’m reading on my internet Como paper every night.</span> <span id="s1984">So somebody’s writing something about American who went to Como, is [indecipherable] and some of them like it.</span> <span id="s1985">And I write to the Como -- to -- to -- to the newspaper, I says, you know, I was raised in Como, I went to the school in Como, and to me to come to Europe and not to visit Como are like going to a candy store and don’t buy candy.</span> <span id="s1986">And I signed my name.</span> <span id="s1987">Next day I get a phone call from a guy who graduate from the thing, become a very famous architect in Como.</span> <span id="s1988">He told me, “Zdenko, you were in school with me.”</span> <span id="s1989">And I was supposed to meet him this year, I was supposed to be matter of fact, this month in Italy.</span> <span id="s1990">It didn’t work out because my wife caught pneumonia this winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: So we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1993">But the guy -- I didn’t hear from him from 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Amazing, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: And -- and he read my name, he recognized right away --</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: -- he say, you know who I am, says yes.</span> <span id="s1998">He said, my name is Berlusconi, and -- and I have my own company, my son is working with me.</span> <span id="s1999">He said he’s also graduate techni [indecipherable] school, and I have a little piccolo azinda.</span> <span id="s2000">It’s like a small enterprise that we are running, me and my son.</span> <span id="s2001">So it’s -- it’s funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: That’s a great story, hopefully you’ll see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Ju -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2004">So it just show you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: Tell me about your meeting with Evelyn in Cinecitta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Cinecitta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: Cinecitta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Cinecitta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Cinecitta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Well, every -- it was a little group [indecipherable] Jewish yentas.</span> <span id="s2011">Now you know what’s a yenta.</span> <span id="s2012">She’s going to probably come and ask me to spell yenta.</span> <span id="s2013">That was my mother, Winkler’s mother, Evie’s mother, and all that, that in front of the building they were living is a little park with the benches.</span> <span id="s2014">So all those ladies in their leisure time, under these pine trees, they were observing the traffic, who is coming, who is coming, who is waiting, who -- who is cheating on who.</span> <span id="s2015">They were like a executive committee.</span> <span id="s2016">And Evie, of course was always -- her mother keep a very close eye on her, where she is going.</span> <span id="s2017">And I was hanging with Evie’s brother, with this Winkler and all of them.</span> <span id="s2018">And my only job in Cinecitta is make to Evie miserable.</span> <span id="s2019">And we -- like we went to a beach, and Evie’s laying on the beach with clothes on.</span> <span id="s2020">I went to kiss her, she went ballistic.</span> <span id="s2021">And I didn’t kiss her in any romantic way, I just know that she’s going to be pissed, and it worked.</span> <span id="s2022">And you know, as long as we were in Cinecitta, I absolutely was romantic.</span> <span id="s2023">Only later when Evie left for America, after I was already going to school in Como, and I never thought that we are going to make a connection again.</span> <span id="s2024">It happened purely accidentally because when we arrive in New York, week before Thanksgiving, or few days before, of 1949, Evie said that -- I don’t know how she tell the story how we met.</span> <span id="s2025">The fact it is the “New York Times,” ran a picture of my family in the front page, like an [indecipherable] with the valise, cardboard valise, the refugee for Naples, because most of refugee coming to New York were from Bremenhaven.</span> <span id="s2026">We were from Naples.</span> <span id="s2027">So they have us there, it just purely accidental.</span> <span id="s2028">And Evie’s mother saw the picture, and then she start calling Jewish services, and we didn’t continue for Kansas City because my Uncle Radon was living already in New York.</span> <span id="s2029">So we were his houseguests for two weeks.</span> <span id="s2030">And as soon as she find out that we are living in Manhattan, Heinz, Evie’s brother come to pick us up and the first Thanksgiving in America, we passed it with Evie and his family.</span> <span id="s2031">And then I went to the army.</span> <span id="s2032">Now, when I went to the army, and I didn’t keep in touch with them -- I visited them occasionally, New York with her brother, but nothing, nothing, nothing to do with Evie.</span> <span id="s2033">When I was drafted, like year and half later, and I’m in Fort Lee, Virginia, in the desert training, every weekend we go -- jumped in the car -- matter of fact, you know, in army post you have this Saturday morning parade, and I figure a way how to beat this parade.</span> <span id="s2034">Was a Brooklyn Jewish kid, his name was Marda from Brooklyn, he had the car.</span> <span id="s2035">So Marda we go to Brooklyn, I get a ride, he says, you get a ride if you go to the first sergeant and you get a pass for me.</span> <span id="s2036">And I come very good with the first sergeant, he -- he -- his name was Ara Bernasconi.</span> <span id="s2037">Italian guy.</span> <span id="s2038">So I was kind of -- got thick with him, and I didn’t have no problem getting passes.</span> <span id="s2039">Problem it was get out of the parade Saturday morning so you could not leave til noon.</span> <span id="s2040">And if you leave Saturday noon for New York, Saturday’s gone.</span> <span id="s2041">So I started a limp -- you know, during the -- I don’t know if you’re familiar with the parade, it’s so funny.</span> <span id="s2042">When you go in front of the review stand and the guy say, eyes right, so everybody start eyes right, and you do too, I start limping.</span> <span id="s2043">So I broke the whole cadence, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2044">All the guys going the step, I start limping.</span> <span id="s2045">So the viewing general told the camp commander, so he said, “That’s kid is sick, why you make him march?”</span> <span id="s2046">So he talked to my first sergeant.</span> <span id="s2047">He said, “Okay, sir, I will fix it up, I’m not going to let him march no more.”</span> <span id="s2048">I was out.</span> <span id="s2049">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: So you -- so you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2052">And -- and I took Martin with me.</span> <span id="s2053">So he had the car and we went every Saturday, already seven o’clock we were on the way to New York, through the New Jersey turnpike, wump -- you didn’t have all the roads you have now, and it was ea -- we had to go through downtown Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: But was no problem at that time to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: So were you spending time with Heinz and then s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Oh, straight to -- I was more time at Evie’s house than mine.</span> <span id="s2058">Then I discover, hey this girl is not bad, you know?</span> <span id="s2059">And maybe while I had a girlfriend that I left in Italy, not that I was romantically involved.</span> <span id="s2060">I was hanging out with her brother, and her mother was figure it out that we would be a good match.</span> <span id="s2061">And where I was stationed -- well, I’m trying to fast forward that, I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s2062">I don’t want to get ahead myself.</span> <span id="s2063">Evie was not interested in me, I was more interested in Evie at this point.</span> <span id="s2064">She had -- a matter of fact had a boyfriend [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2065">And then I had to leave.</span> <span id="s2066">I didn’t -- they send me oversea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: And in that period that I was oversea, I didn’t have no contact with Evie, I didn --</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: You didn’t write to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2071">I -- very little contact with her brother, but -- and my friend Winkler was already in the States living in Kansas City.</span> <span id="s2072">And still I didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s2073">And soon as I come back I went -- there was Christmas 1943, her brother invited me for a New Year’s Eve party.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: You mean ’53.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: ’53, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: So I went from -- from Kansas City for New Year’s Eve party, and I discover a even more prettier Evie.</span> <span id="s2078">And I start giving her hard time, and try to courting, you know, la -- was a very hard thing going because she was not interested in me, I think she was more interest give me a hard time.</span> <span id="s2079">But her mom was interested in me, and her brother was delighted.</span> <span id="s2080">And then finally went back to Kansas City, and I said, look, it’s a very long distance relationship.</span> <span id="s2081">So I start flying every two weeks, TWA from Kansas City to New York.</span> <span id="s2082">That time you had to fly by the way of Chicago, and they had the constellation propeller plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: So it took you six hours.</span> <span id="s2085">And then I -- I rushed from work, I arrived in New York International, her brother pick me up.</span> <span id="s2086">She is watching Brooklyn Dodgers, doesn’t even say hello.</span> <span id="s2087">She ignored [indecipherable] not only she didn’t pick me up.</span> <span id="s2088">I said what the hell I’m doing here?</span> <span id="s2089">And she -- I talk to [indecipherable] Carl Furillo and Roy Campanella, I -- I remember a few of those names from the Brooklyn Dodgers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: She was such a baseball fan.</span> <span id="s2092">Right now she couldn’t care less, but that time she was a big fan [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2093">But I was doing it on every two week basis, and that become very expensive.</span> <span id="s2094">I was in the hock in a matter of six months to TWA something like 3500 bucks.</span> <span id="s2095">1953.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: And your intention was to see her --</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: -- and her intention was to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Her intention to avoid me.</span> <span id="s2100">And I wou -- then finally when she upse -- accepted to marry me, I said we will do it down the line like 12 months, another year or some [indecipherable] two years.</span> <span id="s2101">And I told her, you know, that will not work.</span> <span id="s2102">You can stretch it as long as you want, but I cannot fly [indecipherable] to New York.</span> <span id="s2103">And when she be -- we fast forward what that we got married the following Fourth of July.</span> <span id="s2104">And that’s year -- that was the end of the picnic for Evie, then she got stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: So did you just wear her down?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: I think I did to a certain point wear her down, yes.</span> <span id="s2107">But you know what the funny thing is the -- when I was in Japan, and I was thinking of her because when I was [indecipherable] in Virginia, she was looking pretty good to me.</span> <span id="s2108">At a certain point I write to her and say, you know, I would like to have with you a little more meaningful relationship.</span> <span id="s2109">And if you keep putting off, you don’t have to -- I don’t care.</span> <span id="s2110">I got a different girlfriend in Italy.</span> <span id="s2111">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: What do you think was her a-answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Go ahead, marry her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: That’s what she said.</span> <span id="s2116">The funny part it is that we were married already three, four years, and I have the picture of Italian girl in a kimono that I send her from Tokyo.</span> <span id="s2117">And I have it in a frame behind Evie picture, Evie is in the front.</span> <span id="s2118">And she is living with me now already three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: And she doesn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: And she doesn’t know the gir -- til one day she was cleaning and dusting the picture.</span> <span id="s2121">When she found that picture behind hers, sh -- oh, that was -- I think that was the biggest fight I had with her since our marriage.</span> <span id="s2122">Really, really upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Did you remember that that picture was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: No, completely forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: You forgot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Completely forgot.</span> <span id="s2127">Completely.</span> <span id="s2128">But that’s one of the -- you know, one th -- one of the episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: But the friendship that we develop in this group, like Winkler that I mention several time, and his brother-in-law that was running the kitchen, we become such a tight group that it continue.</span> <span id="s2131">Because Winkler start working for Joint in Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: And we become like Elkia Eliskovich, which was general manager of Joint for Rome in Italy, which was picked up by the office in Paris, which was running whole refugee thing in Europe.</span> <span id="s2134">She liked Winkler, and she put him under her wing.</span> <span id="s2135">She didn’t know how young was the Winkler, but after awhile -- now I’m -- I’m already in Como -- and she said, “You know, Henry, I’m go o -- I need to open office in Milan.</span> <span id="s2136">How would you like to run my office in Milan?”</span> <span id="s2137">And Winkler figure I’m in Como, you got a deal.</span> <span id="s2138">And within two months Winkler and the whole family was in Como with us.</span> <span id="s2139">And he was commuting every day to Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: And he is the guy who put us, you know, to go -- when the all papers come, were supposed to come, he’s -- I wanted to go the same place where he goes.</span> <span id="s2142">So Winkler was -- drawed the [indecipherable] Kansas City.</span> <span id="s2143">And we couldn’t switch it, so we -- we both agreed to Kansas City and then Winkler father got sick, he couldn’t leave with us at the same time.</span> <span id="s2144">And then I brought him back.</span> <span id="s2145">I send him papers and the money to come to America in 1952, before I went to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Before you went to the army, yeah.</span> <span id="s2147">When -- when you discovered after the war, the extent of the brutality and the murder in Europe, was that -- that must have been shocking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2149">We know that was lots of people dying, but th-the horror of the way those people were deported, the -- wi -- nobody knew exactly what was going [indecipherable] war but not completely going.</span> <span id="s2150">The thing only come out when I start meeting lots of those people who survived the camps, and their story, more than the press.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Even told the “Stars and Stripes,” -- that was an army newspaper, they didn’t co -- didn’t hide it, they really brought the atrocity the way they were.</span> <span id="s2153">And then yes, we were all surprised, because we couldn’t believe such inhuman -- inhumanity is possible.</span> <span id="s2154">We didn’t know what happened in Jasenovac.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: -- til after the war.</span> <span id="s2157">We know that people got killed, but the way, I mean, not-- Croatia Nazi were worse than the German Nazis.</span> <span id="s2158">I mean, they were absolutely inhumanely vicious.</span> <span id="s2159">Dying every -- you know, you are dead, you’re dead, but those guys what they done, the way they killed the people is absolutely horrendous what they done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2161">And when it -- when you thought about that, there you were living, it sounds like, a very privileged, protected life --</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: No question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: -- in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: No question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: And here -- if you had se --</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: You -- the -- it cou -- would -- would boggle our mind that something possible like this to happen.</span> <span id="s2167">Even Italians -- even Italian Fascists -- Fascists, hard core Fascists couldn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: If you were not in it, you know, when German -- I believe that the German, as overall, didn’t know what was going in camp, to the extent that it happened.</span> <span id="s2170">They know they were killing Jews.</span> <span id="s2171">And they know there were camps there, even they said they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2172">But nobody can imagine what is happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Nobody, because they ca -- they the -- at least -- at least [indecipherable] there were Jews in charge of extermination of Jews.</span> <span id="s2175">This is special group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: Do you consider yourself a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: I -- I -- I think -- I don’t [indecipherable] concept to put it.</span> <span id="s2178">Yes, I’m definitely a survivor, privileged survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: No question about it.</span> <span id="s2181">When I hear what happened to other people -- we had it so many close calls it was really mind-boggling how come we didn't fall in the trappies of this phone call -- i -- of this close call that we had.</span> <span id="s2182">But the way I lived, the way we survived, the privileges we had.</span> <span id="s2183">The shower, warm water, food.</span> <span id="s2184">I mean, come on --</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: -- I mean, when I hear about the -- Evie in the caves, just few miles down the road from me, where I was leading relatively good, dangerous but good and safe -- not safe, comfortable life, then you know, it’s terrible thing what she went through it as a young kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: I’m never -- you know, I was never to exposed it.</span> <span id="s2189">Not -- you know, it’s a different thing eating and eating good.</span> <span id="s2190">And we were eating good.</span> <span id="s2191">I mean, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: You weren’t just surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: No, we were not just surviving, by all means.</span> <span id="s2194">So -- and I become such a [indecipherable] Italian, on a general thing, because you got a good people, a bad people in any group.</span> <span id="s2195">But the Italian always -- i-in the majority, as a people, they’re unbelievable people.</span> <span id="s2196">Italians jealous, they envious people.</span> <span id="s2197">Like if you were very wealthy in Italy, they could be jealous about your wealth.</span> <span id="s2198">You don’t have nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: -- they will give you the shirts off their back.</span> <span id="s2201">Now you will find occasionally somebody, Italians are always worrying, they’re always hoarding because they never think is enough.</span> <span id="s2202">What happened to Evie, when those farmer, they would like to give her food, but they figure maybe tomorrow they will need it, because they are not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: Not that they want to see her hungry, but that’s how some Italian -- sometimes the Italians work.</span> <span id="s2205">Is not always even handed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2207">We need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: I wanted to ask you about your parents.</span> <span id="s2211">Did they get sick right when you went to Korea, or is this before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: That the only time that my father -- oh e -- oh, excuse me, you’re talking about sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: My father got sick while I was in Korea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: And they both got sick at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: Yeah, m-my mother had the acute pancreitis and my father heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: And my mother was fighting this cute -- acute pancreitis til the day she died.</span> <span id="s2219">A matter of fact, I remember that a physician come and told us -- I almost knocked him right on his tutu -- tell me -- she goes tell my father -- h-he did, he said, “You know, she got maybe two, three days left.”</span> <span id="s2220">She lived til she was 96.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Ninet -- 96 years old, she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2223">And I say, how can you tell the heart patient --</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: You see, what happened that the regular family doctor was not available.</span> <span id="s2226">He was on a vacation.</span> <span id="s2227">He was the guy who operate on her, her surgeon [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2228">So the only one available in Menora Hospital in Kansas City to see her, was him.</span> <span id="s2229">But you figure he’s a surgeon, he should know enough about the pancreas, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s2230">So he told her what a critical thing he did.</span> <span id="s2231">And she use pancreatinis medicine on a regular basis, she didn’t have no problem with it.</span> <span id="s2232">So that’s the period, yeah, they happen -- they were sick while I was in the army --</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: -- and the -- now don’t forget, once I got United States army, Joint -- Jewish welfare was through giving you support.</span> <span id="s2235">They were obliged for five years, but once the army took over, then it’s the Red Cross duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: The Red -- yeah, Red Cross is a back-up for American service, for all the branches of service.</span> <span id="s2238">So Jewish welfare didn’t do nothing to -- with them no more.</span> <span id="s2239">Then the Red Cross come in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: And they helped your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2242">They di -- supported them til I didn -- come home.</span> <span id="s2243">But they told me ahead that they was going to expect to me at one point --</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: To pay it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: -- to go pay it back.</span> <span id="s2246">They don’t make any timetable, but said, you know, they helping other people, whatever you give us back is going to help somebody out tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2247">And we felt morally obligated to return this money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Right, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: And I figure longer I wait, harder it is going to be, so I figure I’m going to get a good job.</span> <span id="s2250">And I -- that -- so I picked up --</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: And that’s when you went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: -- yeah, go in the trade, and I paid it off quite -- relatively quite fast, I paid him back within three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s2254">And your father, did he maintain his health after that first heart attack?</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: My father lived in -- he lived, God bless him, he had a two heart attack, he had a cancer surgery and -- a-and after the surgery, he live additional 12 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2257">And your mother lived much longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: My mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: So you were all living together?</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: We were living -- we -- I never left my p -- when -- when -- when the Nazi come to Zabno, my aunt married to the doctor told my family, listen, I’m protected, I’m not worry.</span> <span id="s2261">Leave Zdenko with me.</span> <span id="s2262">I would never left my parents for one single second.</span> <span id="s2263">And I never said -- even through all the time I was married, that my parents live with me.</span> <span id="s2264">I always give them the courage, the honor, to say I’m living with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: And I give my credit to my wife.</span> <span id="s2267">It is not easy to go ahead and live with mother-in-law as many years she does.</span> <span id="s2268">But my wife was very smart.</span> <span id="s2269">For loss of the privacy, she ha -- got a butler and a cook.</span> <span id="s2270">We left for the morning -- in the morning, we didn’t make the bed, we didn’t have to worry what is for supper.</span> <span id="s2271">We know we are cu -- we went in a gourmet restaurant every day til they were able to cook and take care of us.</span> <span id="s2272">We didn’t shop for grocery.</span> <span id="s2273">My father does the -- everything.</span> <span id="s2274">If he had any wishes, if I would say listen, Mother, make me Punschtorte -- you know what’s a Punschtorte?</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: That’s a brandy cake that I love --</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: -- also Viennese.</span> <span id="s2279">Or make me Sacher torte, or Dobish torte, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: So you do --</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: Pish -- n-not only -- or Cremeschnitten, which are Napoleon.</span> <span id="s2282">I mean, she was famous for it.</span> <span id="s2283">That’s how she got job in the American.</span> <span id="s2284">And she was still -- she cooked -- she died 96, but she was still active in kitchen at 92.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2287">So that was a payback for loss of the privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: Thank God our house was big enough.</span> <span id="s2290">So, you were -- enough space.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: But why my -- my wife is so brilliant that she made a mental rule, never be in kitchen together with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: And when my mother was not capable no more to cook in, my wife took over cooking.</span> <span id="s2295">She was sitting in her Lazy Boy chair and observing in the kitchen, every move, to the point that Evie got so upset that she closed the door, because her eyes were following every step she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: And then we had a -- as other -- as a pay -- payoff for me not going to live in New York, that her parents came at least twice a year.</span> <span id="s2298">And I loved to have them, because when I -- those two cooks together, what I would tell my mother I would like to have a germtike cooking.</span> <span id="s2299">You know what a germtike?</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: That’s a -- germ is a yeast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: I like a yeast sweet, made with yeast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: And my mom -- my mother-in-law had a -- when she made something with chocolate, you know you are a chocolate eater.</span> <span id="s2306">My mother would put [indecipherable] in chocolate --</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: -- in yeast.</span> <span id="s2309">My mother -- when you eat, it was dripping on you.</span> <span id="s2310">So I made them compete against each other, I was sitting back there and laughing.</span> <span id="s2311">Was fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: But that’s an unusual set-up that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: Very unusual set-up, and it worked.</span> <span id="s2314">I used to fight with my mother-in-law that you would not believe it, because my mother-in-law was a very strong willed person.</span> <span id="s2315">But she was not grudge holding person.</span> <span id="s2316">I could have a big screaming match and [indecipherable] said, “Ma, I’m ready to go out, you ready?”</span> <span id="s2317">In five minutes she’s in the car with me.</span> <span id="s2318">She loved to go in the car.</span> <span id="s2319">Five minutes, all the argument, forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: And I loved her.</span> <span id="s2322">She was really a remarkable woman.</span> <span id="s2323">I -- I really loved her [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2324">And she would bring, you know, my nephews, with her --</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: -- when we could not afford yet for them to fly, they would come with the Greyhound bus with two kids.</span> <span id="s2327">It’s a long schlep.</span> <span id="s2328">It is a long, believe me, but she would faithfully they would come to Kansas City to visit.</span> <span id="s2329">I mean, the kids loved it, and I loved to have them, it was really -- it was very interesting arrangement, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: When did you retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: I retired about 12 years ago.</span> <span id="s2334">But the -- to the -- you want me to tell you about the story about my car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: Yeah, I will, but wait a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: Before --</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: When -- have you -- did you at one point decide that you would talk to kids about the Holocaust or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: To -- to my nephews, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Well, either to your nephews, or to schoolchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: No, I -- I never discussed the Holocaust with them, and I’ll tell you exactly why.</span> <span id="s2343">We had so many volunteer Polish that liked to talk about Holocaust, and we -- and I got some of friends which are Hungarians, and I know that the Hungarian Jews know very little about Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2344">Because when most of Jews who were dead, Hungarian were still in Budapest til 1945.</span> <span id="s2345">So they come on too late.</span> <span id="s2346">It is true they paid a dear price, because Hitler had to get rid of them very fast.</span> <span id="s2347">Now, the other Jews, if they young and strong, they had a chance to work in the camp, or some labor.</span> <span id="s2348">But Hungarian Jews, he was trying to kill them fast as he can because Hitler was running out of time.</span> <span id="s2349">But when those Hungarian Jews who didn’t go to the camp was pick up by the Holocaust -- Holocaust, and explained the horror of it, and didn’t experience it, they are hypocrite.</span> <span id="s2350">So I felt if I would go try to go ahead, how can I compare my suffering with those people who come from Poland, so -- from other country, they already -- or Austria?</span> <span id="s2351">So, it was not my place to speak there.</span> <span id="s2352">I was invited, as a matter of fact, to speak to a Jewish retire group next month on 14, which are doctors and the engineers and lawyers in Kansas City, about again, survival in Italy, the Italian Alp.</span> <span id="s2353">But that’s a different chapter, because they were never -- they never any -- any idea.</span> <span id="s2354">But I would never be presumptuous enough to explain the horror of the camp, because I were not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: No, no, I -- I al -- I meant, would you -- were you asked to talk about Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: Nobody --</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: I mean most people don’t even think about Italy, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: No, no, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: This is what be -- upset me more than you can believe.</span> <span id="s2361">They buried this fact, all they know Mussolini, and the Fascist, and r -- and that’s all they know.</span> <span id="s2362">It is so much behind the surface, that is not fair to Italians per se, as a whole, you know, because you cannot -- you don’t have a -- you’ve got bad Jews, too, you’ve got Jews who were putting other Jews in the [indecipherable] in the -- in the -- in the crematory.</span> <span id="s2363">So -- but you cannot make generalize.</span> <span id="s2364">You know, you got exception to every situation.</span> <span id="s2365">I don’t think the guy was shoveling body in the -- i-in the damn h-high temperature to be burned, that he done it because he hate the Jews, he was trying to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: So h-he -- is all depend from what perception and what concept you are looking at it.</span> <span id="s2368">But I did -- they did ask me to speak to schoolchildren, and -- and is very interesting, and I can tell you, Kansas City, I’m very proud to have invitation all over.</span> <span id="s2369">And all the right religious group, they make sure that Holocaust is not forgotten.</span> <span id="s2370">It is amazing.</span> <span id="s2371">Right now in Kansas City we have a third generation of Holocaust survivors speaking about it.</span> <span id="s2372">We have -- those guys something in common with me, they were not the camp, either.</span> <span id="s2373">But they were privileged to say my grandfather.</span> <span id="s2374">I don’t have that.</span> <span id="s2375">See, except for my -- one of my mother brothers, who got caught in Split, like I told you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Nobody else got burned in this Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: Now, my father’s side, in Serbia, they’re killing the first four days the Nazi got in Serbia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: First four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Serbia was a rough [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: Nobody on my father’s side survive.</span> <span id="s2384">Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: Nobody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: Nobody.</span> <span id="s2387">Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: So he was alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: He was -- when the war finished, the only Bergl is left alive.</span> <span id="s2390">And there were four brothers, no sisters, four brothers.</span> <span id="s2391">Remarkable thing it is, by the Jewish community where I have i-in Croatia, that there were very few Jews in comparison to other countries.</span> <span id="s2392">But th -- all very successful Jews.</span> <span id="s2393">I would say is, in Croatia that 80 percent of Jews were self-employed in some kind of business, along with 20 percent working for somebody, or for some enterprise.</span> <span id="s2394">And then a -- in most of community, wherever they live, th-the excellent relationship with Jews.</span> <span id="s2395">It was not an animosity like Poland that when you go in front of church you went pah, pah, pah.</span> <span id="s2396">That didn’t [indecipherable] but it -- it was a very, very tight relationship, right through the whole country, even Bosnia.</span> <span id="s2397">Now, you had some Jews here [indecipherable] you have in -- do you have them here too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: You have a Jewish [indecipherable] in Israel.</span> <span id="s2400">But as a whole that we could really feel?</span> <span id="s2401">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2403">Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: -- excuse me, I want to tell you something which is amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: And is a compliment to the Jewish race.</span> <span id="s2409">From 1947, through 1955, now I’m -- I’m giving you this window because 1955 include Hungarian revolution, when Hungarian Jews start coming to United States.</span> <span id="s2410">In this period in Kansas City come 270 families.</span> <span id="s2411">From hodgepodge of all the countries.</span> <span id="s2412">Almost all of them were self-employed.</span> <span id="s2413">I wouldn’t say more than 15 percent was in group like me, working or learning -- but not big enterprise, some more, some less.</span> <span id="s2414">Some of them immensely successful.</span> <span id="s2415">But what I’m trying to bring a point about the welfare.</span> <span id="s2416">We all went to the school from first day we arrive, to learn English, working at nighttime.</span> <span id="s2417">I restrain from any group coming in the United States want to change the system, or improve the different language in our educational system.</span> <span id="s2418">I don’t care from what country you come.</span> <span id="s2419">If you want to preserve your heritage, f-fine.</span> <span id="s2420">You want to teach your kids so they are bilingual, fantastic.</span> <span id="s2421">But don’t mess around with a system that works.</span> <span id="s2422">That’s why we went to this school.</span> <span id="s2423">And sa -- same Jews now, they were they -- they were -- you know, I had th -- have the blessing of advanced learning, education, faculty and all of them.</span> <span id="s2424">Most Jews in Kansas City, they were so illiterate, and so Jewish oriented, if they picked up “Kansas City Star” in their hand, it didn’t have a picture, they will hold it upside down.</span> <span id="s2425">Can I tell you more than that?</span> <span id="s2426">Only Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2427">And yet, every one of their kids is college graduate.</span> <span id="s2428">From surgeons to doctor to engineers, to professional -- is absol -- mind-boggling.</span> <span id="s2429">So it is a land of opportunity.</span> <span id="s2430">Those pi -- you know, those parents are so ignorant in comparison to their kids and grandchildren, is mind-boggling.</span> <span id="s2431">But they were willing to work.</span> <span id="s2432">I don’t care what work they performed.</span> <span id="s2433">They were very, very successful what they were doing.</span> <span id="s2434">Never on welfare.</span> <span id="s2435">I don’t know a single Jewish in Kansas City that’s went on welfare.</span> <span id="s2436">They accepted from Jewish community to get started only, but every one of them was very anxious to go on.</span> <span id="s2437">I don’t know anybody who did not send their kids to college.</span> <span id="s2438">I never see -- every si -- every one of our friends, the kids have.</span> <span id="s2439">And some of them from prestigious universities.</span> <span id="s2440">So it is something in willingness to work.</span> <span id="s2441">Jews are not lazy people.</span> <span id="s2442">And they have a hump to pick up and go from nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: You know, even to this day, when I socialize with my friends, and I know they are much smarter than they are.</span> <span id="s2445">I mean, bias to show how much smarter I am than they are.</span> <span id="s2446">Instead of bringing them down, I bring myself, lots of times to their level.</span> <span id="s2447">I’m more comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s2448">And -- and sometime when I say something tremendously stupid, I don’t want to make them feel that way.</span> <span id="s2449">I try to explain as gently as possible where they making a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: And I’m very proud of my heritage where I am, and I cannot emphasize enough.</span> <span id="s2452">I’m not a very religious person, I’m not a very observant person, belong to a shul.</span> <span id="s2453">We don’t go there [indecipherable] not even [indecipherable] imagination as much as the shul.</span> <span id="s2454">But we, you know, with the Jewish holiday, we try to be part of it, we observe the Jewish holiday, always someplace for New Year’s Eve, or the other Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s2455">But heritage is very important.</span> <span id="s2456">And I -- I -- I tell you, Evie had lots to do with it, because she come from Vienna, from different, much more Jewish surrounding than I do.</span> <span id="s2457">I was dabbling so much -- that’s why I had such a close relationship with my Gentile friend in Croatia.</span> <span id="s2458">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s2459">You know, when they write to me for holidays, send us matches.</span> <span id="s2460">I’m sending matches all over Croatia, they love it.</span> <span id="s2461">When the -- when is a -- they don’t know when holy day, when is the matches season?</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2463">You wanted to tell us a story about bringing your Cadillac to Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: Well, see, when I left, when I was not quite 13 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: -- my dream it was -- when you lost everything.</span> <span id="s2467">I mean, everything my father worked.</span> <span id="s2468">I said one day I’m going to come back and show these people the Bergl family still got something.</span> <span id="s2469">So as soon -- when I go -- bought my first car, and a -- I left in 1941, and didn’t return til ’72.</span> <span id="s2470">31 years pass.</span> <span id="s2471">And I say I have to make a big entrance when I come.</span> <span id="s2472">I did some still [indecipherable] ship’s traffic between New York.</span> <span id="s2473">I had a friend who might drive my car in New York, I -- my f -- parents loved to travel by ship.</span> <span id="s2474">So they took a car with them on the ship, me and Evie, we flew to Genoa.</span> <span id="s2475">We sit down in the car, I put American flag on my antenna, and I drive in my hometown.</span> <span id="s2476">Within 10 minutes the word spread, Jew is back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: Jew is back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: Yeah, Jew is b -- not in a derogatory manner, you mean -- s-so they come to us, says listen, we took everything away from you, you didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s2479">How did you do it?</span> <span id="s2480">So I said listen, it’s very simple.</span> <span id="s2481">We apply to go to America.</span> <span id="s2482">Once we arrived in New York, the Jewish committee from New York waited for us.</span> <span id="s2483">Give us a key from the car, give us a key for the house [indecipherable] is in the book.</span> <span id="s2484">They says, here with us, you’re welcome to America.</span> <span id="s2485">And the guy say, you kidding.</span> <span id="s2486">I said, no, it’s very simple, all you have to be Jewish, hand you everything.</span> <span id="s2487">Jews are waiting for you with -- to give you stuff.</span> <span id="s2488">And the guy -- those farmer were just shaking their head.</span> <span id="s2489">Should I tell them they arrive in America sweeping floor?</span> <span id="s2490">Would that impress him?</span> <span id="s2491">No.</span> <span id="s2492">And I wanted to do the impact, and it worked.</span> <span id="s2493">And they bought it.</span> <span id="s2494">They actually believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">Q: Did you ever tell them that wasn’t true?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A: Never te -- never told them.</span> <span id="s2497">Well, later on they could s -- draw their own conclusion through the years, because I came many times back, with a little later on confusion because I didn’t take my car, but I rented the car, one time a Mercedes, one time a Volvo.</span> <span id="s2498">So I come there all different cars in -- you know, when I came to my hometown.</span> <span id="s2499">But this first -- I wanted to make a splash the first time I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: Well, you certainly made one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: And I di -- with American flag, y-you don’t [indecipherable] you don’t have any idea, communist Yugoslavia and I’m have the guts to fly American flag.</span> <span id="s2502">I’m -- when I was driving to capital of Zagreb, the police stop and pa -- let me pass, they thought I was American embassy.</span> <span id="s2503">That big -- like [indecipherable], there’s nowhere to put me.</span> <span id="s2504">On tollbooth they didn’t know to charge me as a car or as a bus, it was so huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: This was a Cadillac in 1972?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: And where did you put the flag, in the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A: On antenna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: On the antenna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: Very clever.</span> <span id="s2512">And Evie was in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: Evie -- my whole family --</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: And your fa -- your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: -- oh, oh, you kidding, when we go -- that’s I tell you, when the word spread that, know that when I say Jew come to town, it means Jew, the guy that we took everything from.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: You know, we left, they took everything from me.</span> <span id="s2518">And they start asking me -- then I come with this bull story, to tell them how we acquire all the -- and -- and that’s funny because I stay for about one week.</span> <span id="s2519">I -- I have to tell you other story about this thing.</span> <span id="s2520">When I’m driving with this Cadillac from Zagreb to my hometown, and you go through lots of small town, and you got still farmer, they use oxen to pull the hay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: And like they would go over there, take the hay in middle of the field, hi -- hi -- farmer is in front of the oxen, and he goes to the field to hitch the wagon to take it back t -- you understand?</span> <span id="s2523">So -- and I can’t move because the oxen go slow.</span> <span id="s2524">And [indecipherable] the grill on my Cadillac [indecipherable] to fit from the [indecipherable] when one of [indecipherable] on my hood on my car.</span> <span id="s2525">I was cleaning for two days with tooth and brush.</span> <span id="s2526">So I -- from now on, whenever I go from Croatian town, plenty room between me and my car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: You and the ox.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2529">But was a big experience, a great satisfaction, believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: You know, I had the blowout on the Italian outerstrada because we’re going pretty fast.</span> <span id="s2532">And finding a tire for a Cadillac, spare tire, is almost impossible, til I come -- call -- call American embassy.</span> <span id="s2533">So I said, you know, I am looking for -- he says, oh -- the guy told me, he said, no problem, we got plenty tire in our -- all our ca -- Cadillacs on our staff, and we are [indecipherable] in our embassy.</span> <span id="s2534">Come over here.</span> <span id="s2535">I went to American embassy, they gave me a tire, I sign a sheet.</span> <span id="s2536">Two months later I got a bill from State department for the tire.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2538">But you didn’t have an accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: Wa -- no, no, no accident, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: It was -- I was not -- I was not always doing, it just happened that from the speed and load, I wa -- we were carrying -- see, I had the carrier on top of -- was temporary carrier with the straps.</span> <span id="s2542">From the speed, the carrier broke.</span> <span id="s2543">And in one box, I had like 200 neckties.</span> <span id="s2544">When those neckties broke loose, the box hit the highway, and on the side of the road were olive trees.</span> <span id="s2545">Those trees were decorate like Christmas tree with the neckties.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: With the neckties.</span> <span id="s2547">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2549">But it was experience.</span> <span id="s2550">One time I y -- I was happy [indecipherable] and at that time was cheap, was 500 dollar round trip to Italy with my car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: Wow, fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: It was worth it, every penny of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: And there were -- my folks came back, there I flew to New York, I picked them up, and I drove the car and then back to Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2556">Well, it’s quite an ending.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">A: Now that was -- that wa -- tha-that was about the most glorious return home I can have, despite that I return many other times, and I have very dear friend and family.</span> <span id="s2558">I cannot en -- equal my first come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: Come -- time, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s2561">Because they really thought that they got us down, and they figure they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: And you’ve gone back to Italy a number of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">A: Italy is for me really more important now --</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">A: -- is important to my life than Croatia because my connection with Italy not only as a country, as a beauty, as in a very, very good friend, you know.</span> <span id="s2566">It is -- it is undescribable how close connection we have with some of the people in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: And problem with Europe right now the economic situation it is, be-become [indecipherable] very expenses.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">A: You know.</span> <span id="s2571">And we are retired people, we’re living well, but we -- we are never unlimited means.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: And in the past when we travel in Europe, we stayed with all the friends, they insisted, the family.</span> <span id="s2574">All that we get would require certain comfort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">A: You know.</span> <span id="s2577">To go to visit somebody house with one bathroom, four or five people in, you have to cross hallway to other room to get -- the middle of the night, you have to get dress --</span></p>

id="s2582">So it become -- it’s no more pleasure.</span> <span id="s2583">If you go in the trip, I don’t need luxury, but I need comfort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: Otherwise I don’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: And the lee -- l-last but not least, most of our friend live on second and third floor without elevator.</span> <span id="s2588">And that’s is [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Q: It’s bu -- yeah, it’s impossible --</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: It is not possible to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: And to go in hotel, a decent hotel today in Europe, I don’t care if it’s Italy or France or Germany, is cost you about 150 to 200 bucks.</span> <span id="s2593">Modest hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: I’m not talking about Sheraton and Hilton, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: -- Carillon in Paris or something like that.</span> <span id="s2598">Or Ritz.</span> <span id="s2599">Because if you want a first class hotel in Europe, cost you 600 bucks for a average room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2601">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: And this is a sin.</span> <span id="s2603">But as long as Japanese have the money, sky is limit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: Before Japanese in -- invasion of -- of Las Vegas, you with a nice room for 50 bucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: Well, everything changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">A: No, I’m talking, but it’s a reason why they change.</span> <span id="s2608">But I love America.</span> <span id="s2609">I’m so proud to be American.</span> <span id="s2610">I become in the Midwest, a redneck American, I’m Democrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: But you’re a redneck?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: But I am a redneck American.</span> <span id="s2613">I think -- I think so much of this country, that my word will never able on this film describe how much I think of this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: Not only that this the greatest country of the earth, and that you have opportunity and that so many people take advantage of the system, and the system is full of hole.</span> <span id="s2616">And the politician, some of the good, some bad, it is true.</span> <span id="s2617">We have corrupt, we have a problem, but is not better on the earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: Because if you compare what is any other place, you don’t have perfection,
