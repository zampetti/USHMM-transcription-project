id="s20">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s21">Lore Schore, conducted by Agnieszka McClure, on October 17th, 2010, at the Kinderstransport Association Conference, in Arlington, Virginia.</span> <span id="s22">I'm sorry again about mispronouncing your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: That's why I tell people.</span> <span id="s24">Nobody knows how.</span> <span id="s25">I tell them.</span> <span id="s26">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: By the way, in case you want to know, Schore is a Hebrew word.</span> <span id="s29">It means ox.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: It means ox, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: That's my husband's name, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And your maiden name was Lichtenstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Lichtenstein, in German, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Where in Germany are you from?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: From Berlin.</span> <span id="s37">Can you tell us a little bit about your childhood in Berlin?</span> <span id="s38">How much you remember</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I remember almost everything from then and then later on it gets vague.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: The microphone was clipped to your jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Where do you want me to put it?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Maybe on your shirt, if you don't mind, so you can clip it to your shirt.</span> <span id="s43">All those technical things.</span> <span id="s44">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Technical problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Let me do that.</span> <span id="s47">I will put it on your collar.</span> <span id="s48">That is probably going to be the best place because it's out of the way.</span> <span id="s49">So you mentioned that you were raised in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: In a nice, comfortable middleclass family.</span> <span id="s51">My I have no sisters or brothers.</span> <span id="s52">I'm an only child.</span> <span id="s53">I don't even have a first cousin.</span> <span id="s54">And to jump ahead, I now have eight greatgrandchildren, which is more than most people can say, I think.</span> <span id="s55">And I may have more because I still have one grandchild who is not attached yet.</span> <span id="s56">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s57">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s58">I grew up in this comfortable home with a kinderfraulein.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: That means the nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Nanny.</span> <span id="s61">They were not always nice, those kinderfraulein, but we were always comfortable.</span> <span id="s62">And I went to kindergarten and to elementary school there, and I my father died when I was three.</span> <span id="s63">So my grandfather was a male presence in my family, and I adored him, and he was a lovely man, and my mother was a very young widow and had her own problems.</span> <span id="s64">And I went on to a Jewish school after leaving elementary school because they were there.</span> <span id="s65">And by that time, we moved to the area called Grunewald on the Roseneck, which is quite a smart area in Berlin.</span> <span id="s66">And I stayed there.</span> <span id="s67">And then, at the very end, by that time I was over 14, they stuck me in an art school because I was extremely talented, they tell me, but I never got anywhere with that.</span> <span id="s68">I did some posters later on.</span> <span id="s69">Anyhow, by the time the socalled Kristallnacht, which wasn't called that in Berlin, you understand.</span> <span id="s70">That was put on to that episode by the American press, that expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: And, anyhow, I remember where we lived, there was one Jewish jeweller on the corner at the Rosenach, and they had forgotten it was supposed to be a spontaneous uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Except they forgot that one store.</span> <span id="s75">They came the next day and bashed it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: So that was that.</span> <span id="s78">And I was comfortable.</span> <span id="s79">We took summer holidays in interesting places.</span> <span id="s80">The Baltic.</span> <span id="s81">And dances where my grandfather's family came from.</span> <span id="s82">We went to Sarkot and stayed and went swimming.</span> <span id="s83">It was a peaceful, pleasant time.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">And then, of course, again, after this, you know what happened, my mother rushed about getting me onto a Kindertransport, and she succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: How old were you when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: 15.</span> <span id="s87">I was one of the older children.</span> <span id="s88">Right now, I am one of the oldest ladies here, I think, by far.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Well, and it doesn't show at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Good for you.</span> <span id="s91">Thank you.</span> <span id="s92">But I am.</span> <span id="s93">And when we went swimming last summer, my son and I, in the Atlantic, he kept on telling me, Don't swim out so far.</span> <span id="s94">Remember, you're 36 86andahalf, which he rubbed it in a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: That's a good problem to have, not to swim out to</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I'm here, and I'm fairly well.</span> <span id="s97">And I had a little lumpectomy, which ladies get, but you know that.</span> <span id="s98">Okay.</span> <span id="s99">In the meantime, they sent me off in Berlin in May of '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So, just to come back a little bit more to your background in Berlin.</span> <span id="s101">So, you come from a middleclass, fairly welloff family.</span> <span id="s102">You attended most of your schools in Berlin, then, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And you are the only child.</span> <span id="s105">And you are very in touch with your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And not so much</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: My mother was a little bit difficult, but this is really too long.</span> <span id="s109">You don't want to go into all that.</span> <span id="s110">But anyhow, she took me to the station where we were leaving, and I was very happy talking to a school fellow school girl that had gone to the same classes I did.</span> <span id="s111">We were talking, and my mother all of a sudden started yelling that I had to go and sit next to her because she finally got emotionally involved in this departure.</span> <span id="s112">Okay.</span> <span id="s113">We got on the train.</span> <span id="s114">On the next station, my aunt, whom I loved very much too, was there to wave goodbye to me.</span> <span id="s115">She was eventually she lived in France, and the French police addressed arrested her and sent her to Auschwitz where she was murdered â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: in the '40s.</span> <span id="s118">Okay.</span> <span id="s119">Then I was got to London.</span> <span id="s120">First, we went by boat to from where did we leave from?</span> <span id="s121">To Harwich from Hook Von Holland, I think, and then to Harwich, and then by train to London, Euston Station, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And were you you seemed to be happy to be on the train, or am I</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I was not miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Not miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: And there was lots of young people, and we sang songs on the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: And you weren't did you</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I was not afraid.</span> <span id="s128">I was not petrified.</span> <span id="s129">I had they said people should come with woolsack.</span> <span id="s130">Everybody else had suitcases.</span> <span id="s131">I had a woolsack because my mother followed the rules.</span> <span id="s132">Okay.</span> <span id="s133">In London I was picked up by a lady who ran a girl school in East Molesey in Surrey.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Oh, the county, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s136">And so she picked me up.</span> <span id="s137">And I had English, I had English for a couple of years and I had French more, but that didn't do me any good there.</span> <span id="s138">And then she took me to this East Molesey girl school.</span> <span id="s139">It was called Mildred's Lodge.</span> <span id="s140">And one of the ladies here was there as well, and I remembered her.</span> <span id="s141">She didn't remember me, but that can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">So we were there, I would say, for quite six months, I would think, something like that, and I was sent to an art school in somewhere near there.</span> <span id="s143">I can't remember the name now of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: So they apparently thought you were talented as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I was talented, but then, you know, if you don't make use of it, it fades.</span> <span id="s146">Anyhow, they were there was the school had a dance or something, and one of the boys afterwards called me, and that was a great scandal.</span> <span id="s147">And the lady who had looked from Germany who had looked after us not looked after us, but promoted the whole thing, she said stay away from men.</span> <span id="s148">They only want one thing.</span> <span id="s149">You know, the whole routine.</span> <span id="s150">Before your time, thank God.</span> <span id="s151">Anyhow, I think I was after spending holiday in Devonshire, or was it I don't remember now.</span> <span id="s152">Mrs. Atkinson, who was a marvelous Quaker lady, who walked around with what is that called?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: In German, it's schnecke.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Oh, like little buns?</span> <span id="s156">She had little</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Snails.</span> <span id="s158">She wore silver buckles on her shoe, and she had a lovely house in the country and many sons, and they had a badger in a garage or in a barn.</span> <span id="s159">It was fairly interesting, and I liked it there.</span> <span id="s160">So we had a holiday there.</span> <span id="s161">Then after that, I think they didn't want me in that school anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Because of the dance?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Because of that boy's phone call.</span> <span id="s164">Big deal.</span> <span id="s165">But it was a different time, and those people were different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s168">Then they stuck me somewhere in Hampshire with an old lady and her daughter.</span> <span id="s169">They had seven cats.</span> <span id="s170">And they didn't order much milk.</span> <span id="s171">It was a tower that had been built by Pitt, I think, against Napoleon, the expected invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: And it was three stories, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s174">It wasn't very wonderful.</span> <span id="s175">There was no indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s176">But it was still summer, so it was all right.</span> <span id="s177">After awhile, that didn't seem to be a solution.</span> <span id="s178">And they stuck me with a vicar in a town called Lockerley.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Why did they move you to the vicar?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Who knows.</span> <span id="s181">I wasn't always consulted.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s183">It seemed that you didn't really bond with those people that you stayed with, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Never, no.</span> <span id="s185">And the people that the lady there, the vicaress, if there is such a word, there isn't, but the lady, she had four daughters, and her husband was not allowed to smoke in the house, which was good.</span> <span id="s186">He smoked a pipe.</span> <span id="s187">His sermons were very poor.</span> <span id="s188">I had enough English by then, but I went to the sermons.</span> <span id="s189">I went to church when they had services because it was the only entertainment then.</span> <span id="s190">After that, somehow was it a joint committee who used to transfer people?</span> <span id="s191">You don't know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Yeah, that is somewhat obscure, but I think that's</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: It's in London.</span> <span id="s194">And they moved me on to North Hampton where I got stuck for awhile longer, and there was a curate who took me in.</span> <span id="s195">Curate is an assistant vicar.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: And she was a very glamorous lady, and he was a very sweet man.</span> <span id="s198">Their name was Evans.</span> <span id="s199">I remember that.</span> <span id="s200">And so I stayed with them, again being sent to art school.</span> <span id="s201">I don't think it really knocked in, you know, kicked in at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: It didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s204">But anyhow, it was all right.</span> <span id="s205">It was tiresome.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Among the other interesting things, this may interest you, your group, there was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s207">And because in in North Hampton.</span> <span id="s208">And he wore a clerical collar.</span> <span id="s209">I don't know if anybody else ever told you that, but it is a very unusual thing for a rabbi to do, but he said the other clergyman, they wore a clerical collar, so he did too.</span> <span id="s210">This was an edification on his part.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s212">That is actually pretty unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Mighty unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: So okay.</span> <span id="s216">So I spent some time there.</span> <span id="s217">And then my mother kept running to London to the America she was by that time she had come to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: How did she manage to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Domestic VISA.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: So she was probably one of the early people who managed to get on</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: She came very late, just before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And you came on the first was it one of the first transports?</span> <span id="s225">Was it still in winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s227">In May.</span> <span id="s228">The first one started in, I think, November or December.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: I think it was somewhere around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s231">So, anyway, my mother kept going to London to the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s232">And somehow I don't know how that all worked out, but they found out that when I was born, my father was an American citizen.</span> <span id="s233">He had lived in America for 25 or so years.</span> <span id="s234">He went back to Germany to visit relatives after World War I, met my mother in doesn't matter where Quebec.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Was he also</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: And they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Was he also Jewish or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s241">And, again, my mother was cute, and he was a nice man, and I think she wanted to be on the only girl on the block to be married to an American.</span> <span id="s242">I'm pretty sure that was anyhow, they were married.</span> <span id="s243">I was born 10 months later.</span> <span id="s244">And, again, my father died when I was three, which was not a really terrible, you know.</span> <span id="s245">Anyhow, so after that now we're jumping back.</span> <span id="s246">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s247">I'm not going chronologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s249">But at least we are coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: In the meantime, the American Embassy found out.</span> <span id="s251">There was a new law on the books, the Nationality Act of 1940, and that because when I was born, my father was an American citizen, I could be an American citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Well, that was a good thing at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s254">It was I was given a passport, but only if I left England.</span> <span id="s255">So a cousin and uncle took me to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s256">I went to Wales.</span> <span id="s257">I took a ferry from Wales to Dublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I went by train from Dublin to Galway.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: And where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: In Ireland.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: In Ireland, mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Far western Ireland.</span> <span id="s264">And there was a ship leaving for the U.S. and I can't remember the name.</span> <span id="s265">It may have been Washington or I don't remember.</span> <span id="s266">And they were full of Americans who were going to America, but they were only just Americans.</span> <span id="s267">Many were born there, and then the parents moved back to Europe or whatever.</span> <span id="s268">And some of them were Americans who were on summer holiday.</span> <span id="s269">Now, the war had started.</span> <span id="s270">They were insane.</span> <span id="s271">And the ship I went on to finally was stopped by a German submarine already off the coast of Spain or Portugal, I think.</span> <span id="s272">So, anyhow, we got there.</span> <span id="s273">They had covered up the swimming pool with planks and put cots on there for all these people to go back to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So your mother was also on the ship with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: My mother stayed in England.</span> <span id="s276">And I had great fun on the boat after I stopped being seasick.</span> <span id="s277">And there were many young people on it.</span> <span id="s278">And then, when I got to New York, in those days, they didn't let young women off ships because they were afraid of white slavery.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Oh, yes, mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Except nobody paid any attention to me, and there I was standing on the pier in New York and nobody was there to meet me.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: And who was there supposed to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: My uncle had been sent he had just come from France, and he was sent a telegram, but which obviously didn't get there.</span> <span id="s283">It was war time</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: in England.</span> <span id="s286">That was another thing that was interesting.</span> <span id="s287">From England, I was with my gas</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: With your?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: gas mask.</span> <span id="s290">And I had to hand it in.</span> <span id="s291">And then in Ireland, everything was lit up, which made an enormous change after the blackouts of London.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Or North Hampton or wherever.</span> <span id="s294">Anyhow, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s295">And I was 16, and it was quite worrisome, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: I could only imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">And then, being new to New York who knows that there are five boroughs and five telephone books, so I tried to find my uncle and of course he didn't have a phone, I will tell you why later, and I did find an aunt, cousin of my father's, who had started a boarding house.</span> <span id="s299">And she was not surprised to hear from me, and she said, "Well, take a trolley car, blah, blah, blah."</span> <span id="s300">I was much too sophisticated.</span> <span id="s301">I put my luggage in storage, and I took a taxi.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And you obviously had money, then, with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Enough money for that.</span> <span id="s304">And so she I went to her house, I found it.</span> <span id="s305">And then she took me by trolley to my uncle's rooms.</span> <span id="s306">He was also rooming in some other boarding house.</span> <span id="s307">I mean, these people had just gotten here, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: And until the day he died, he denied, but he looked at me I was 16 by that time and curvy.</span> <span id="s310">When he'd last seen me, I was 12 and a skinny little thing, and he clicked his heels, and he introduced himself, Schneidermul (ph), that was his name.</span> <span id="s311">He didn't recognize me for obvious reasons.</span> <span id="s312">And then his wife came home, and she dealt with the situation.</span> <span id="s313">They stuck me somewhere in a room.</span> <span id="s314">And then I was handed on to one of these something of Jewish Council of Jewish Women.</span> <span id="s315">They took a little care of me.</span> <span id="s316">I got put into you know, being a nanny or babysitter, whatever it was at that time.</span> <span id="s317">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s318">It was the summer.</span> <span id="s319">It gets very hot in New York in the summer.</span> <span id="s320">It was a big surprise Washington was worse, I think.</span> <span id="s321">And so they stuck me somewhere.</span> <span id="s322">It was all right.</span> <span id="s323">And then things get a little vague now.</span> <span id="s324">I don't remember everything.</span> <span id="s325">But I spent time with these people and then somehow the they sent me to art school again no, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s326">I went to high school then for a little bit.</span> <span id="s327">For a yearandahalf or so, I went to high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Through the association, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: They pushed me into it.</span> <span id="s330">But the thing is, I was never a very great student as a child, but in New York, I was fabulous.</span> <span id="s331">I was a very good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Well, very good.</span> <span id="s333">A: I had an education behind me, but that was it.</span> <span id="s334">And after that, I think I got, again, as my mother used to say, from Pontius to Pilate, they sent me around.</span> <span id="s335">And I got funny things.</span> <span id="s336">I think I started working somewhere.</span> <span id="s337">At Revlon, not for very long.</span> <span id="s338">Eventually I found a job at a printing outfit, and there I was a stripper.</span> <span id="s339">Haha.</span> <span id="s340">It's not a joke there.</span> <span id="s341">It was something you do.</span> <span id="s342">Layouts, it was called stripping.</span> <span id="s343">So I use that because it's really amusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: So I assumed that.</span> <span id="s345">So what were you exactly stripping?</span> <span id="s346">Boxes out of lids or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No.</span> <span id="s348">Stripping is to put it was called photo offset printing, lithography.</span> <span id="s349">And they did something called Goldenrod, and the film on which the stuff was printed was cut out and that was called stripping.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Stripping.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: And then they put it on a press.</span> <span id="s352">Not a letter press, on a circular thing.</span> <span id="s353">And it was run on the letter press after that.</span> <span id="s354">And my husbandtobe was working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: So your husband number three, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Oh, to be, you said.</span> <span id="s358">Okay.</span> <span id="s359">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s360">I misheard you.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: My husbandtobe, and he was a very nice fellow, and eventually we got married.</span> <span id="s362">By that time, my mother had come from England.</span> <span id="s363">And I think that's about it.</span> <span id="s364">We were married.</span> <span id="s365">We lived in New York.</span> <span id="s366">We got another apartment, which was</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: There are some gnats here.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Flies, whatever, yeah.</span> <span id="s369">We got another apartment.</span> <span id="s370">I had two children.</span> <span id="s371">My son's name is Robin, and he is now 65, going on 66.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: And my daughter is Wendy, and she's also married.</span> <span id="s374">She married a boy next door, who is Irish and RC.</span> <span id="s375">Do you know what that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: No, I do not.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Roman Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Roman Catholic, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: We all lived in Manhattan, and then my son went into the Army during the Vietnam War.</span> <span id="s380">But he was not shipped for Vietnam, fortunately.</span> <span id="s381">He was leading two trains back and forth with prisoners and stuff like that, I think.</span> <span id="s382">I don't remember now.</span> <span id="s383">And both children are married.</span> <span id="s384">My daughter is two years younger than my son, and they both had nice weddings.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: That's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: My soninlaw's my son's fatherinlaw was a Viennese, which means nothing because we speak different languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Truly.</span> <span id="s389">I won't go into details.</span> <span id="s390">But he now is round the bend and is in assisted living, and he's still around, though.</span> <span id="s391">He's over 90 by now, 92, but he's still there.</span> <span id="s392">Anyhow, they had two girls eventually, and my daughter had two boys and a girl.</span> <span id="s393">And, again, now I have eight greatgrandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Yeah, that's quite</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Which is my claim to fame.</span> <span id="s396">And they're all wonderful and adorable and cute.</span> <span id="s397">And they're all little girls except one little boy, which is also surprising.</span> <span id="s398">And I think that's about the end of the story.</span> <span id="s399">I'm here.</span> <span id="s400">I'm coping.</span> <span id="s401">I moved from New York to New Jersey six years ago because my children got tired of taking the Cross Bronx Expressway or the the what is the other bridge?</span> <span id="s402">The Verrazano Bridge.</span> <span id="s403">And now from the Christmas in Berlin, I now have Christmas in New Jersey and I had it in New York, and everybody comes.</span> <span id="s404">The new house is somewhat small, so we don't even have room for all the presents, and we have to stretch the walls.</span> <span id="s405">Q: Well, that's a good problem to have, though, not enough room for all the presents.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: A lot of people by Christmas, I have, like, 1820 people, which is a lot for this little condo that I live in.</span> <span id="s407">But I live on a patio, there is a patio outside, and there is a golf course.</span> <span id="s408">I left out of my life later, very important part.</span> <span id="s409">When the children went to school, my husband gave me a present of a pair of really cruddy Japanese binoculars, individual focus, really terrible, and we were going with friends on a Mother's Day, '36 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: '56, in '56.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: '56.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: And we went on a picnic.</span> <span id="s414">And I used the binoculars.</span> <span id="s415">.</span> <span id="s416">I took my children's little Golden Guide.</span> <span id="s417">You may not know those, but they were lovely little books.</span> <span id="s418">And the first two birds I saw were Rosebreasted Grosbeak and a Magnolia Warbler, and I was seduced.</span> <span id="s419">I mean, I couldn't ever figure on anything better than to go out and look at birds.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: So that has been my passion.</span> <span id="s422">I've traveled all over the world now.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Watching birds?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Watching birds.</span> <span id="s425">But I also do flowers and other I'm a naturalist now, you know, in quotation marks.</span> <span id="s426">Not by training because I my education is painfully neglected, but I can read and write, and I can look at birds, and I can look things up.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">And the trips that I've taken, I mean, even traveled together, my husband and I when he was still well, and then he had four primary cancers, and the last years were impossible.</span> <span id="s428">He was very, very ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s431">And it went on.</span> <span id="s432">And after he died, I started, you know first I went to Kenya, and then I went to South Africa, and I went all over South America and the West Indies, and I went to Madagascar and to India and to Borneo, Malaysia.</span> <span id="s433">I was in Finland, then I was in Spain and in Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: And all watching birds, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Almost always, yeah.</span> <span id="s436">It was very exciting.</span> <span id="s437">Now I'm getting a little old for that kind of crap excuse me, excuse me.</span> <span id="s438">And I whatever I do, there are a little far fewer birds, but it's still a passion for me.</span> <span id="s439">And if I I have a feeder three feeders outside four feeders.</span> <span id="s440">And I watch whatever comes in the yard socalled yard.</span> <span id="s441">And I garden a little now.</span> <span id="s442">In other words, my life is okay.</span> <span id="s443">It isn't stimulating where I am.</span> <span id="s444">It's bland.</span> <span id="s445">It's a senior retirement community.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Well, not everyone's life is extremely stimulating.</span> <span id="s447">I would say the majority has a normal have a normal life, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s449">Other people play bridge, tennis, golf.</span> <span id="s450">None of the above.</span> <span id="s451">I don't do any of those things.</span> <span id="s452">If I don't go birding, I read.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: But you swim also.</span> <span id="s454">You mention that you swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I swim what?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: You mention that you swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Did I mention it?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Yeah, you mentioned you told me that your son told you not to swim too far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s460">But where I live now, it's too far to go to the beach.</span> <span id="s461">I used to go to Jones Beach or Petre Island, Gratiot, and now that is too far for me, and I go swimming in the pool.</span> <span id="s462">But I still drive and not at night.</span> <span id="s463">I've decided to stop driving in the dark.</span> <span id="s464">It's not such fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: That's harder.</span> <span id="s466">It's not as the visibility isn't as good, right, at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: It's a little bit dangerous, I think, for other people too.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: I will think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: You're not there yet.</span> <span id="s470">Wait until you're 86andahalf.</span> <span id="s471">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Could you I wanted to ask you, so it seems that you really was unless I'm reading wrong what you're saying, but you didn't seem to be very concerned going to England</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: taking the trip to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I cried a lot when I first came there, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Because it was different?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s478">Who knew from cornflakes, who knew of porridge.</span> <span id="s479">You know, all these things, it was strange.</span> <span id="s480">The coffee was awful.</span> <span id="s481">Of course I didn't drink coffee until a little bit later and â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Were you worried about what was happening in Europe at home possibly to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s484">But we didn't know about the horrors, you know.</span> <span id="s485">They didn't publish it.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: That's yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: People didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So you didn't learn about it until</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: We didn't learn even in America when I got there a year later, they didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And you got to America in '40, 1940, or was it '41?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: That I left? '</span> <span id="s492">40.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: '40, mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: England, yeah.</span> <span id="s495">People didn't it wasn't published.</span> <span id="s496">And they people came out from Europe and said this is going on and nobody listened.</span> <span id="s497">They couldn't believe it because it is unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Yeah, that's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: I went to Yad Vashem, and my husband who came from Eastern Europe, when he was born, it was Russia.</span> <span id="s500">By the time they left after World War I, it was Poland.</span> <span id="s501">And he was a very sweet man and my children adored him.</span> <span id="s502">After awhile when people get sicker, they don't get nicer.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: That's true.</span> <span id="s504">What was he called?</span> <span id="s505">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Ben Schore.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Ben Schore?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Did you you were already a little bit older in England, older than majority of children.</span> <span id="s510">Did you try did you try to help your mother arrive to England?</span> <span id="s511">Try to work some paperwork</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I wasn't consulted.</span> <span id="s513">I don't know.</span> <span id="s514">I was told she was coming and that's before the war started.</span> <span id="s515">So she really got out in the nick of time.</span> <span id="s516">And when she came to America, I picked her up at some kind of gathering point.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Do you know how she managed to get to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: The I have no idea it's too I don't remember now.</span> <span id="s519">But eventually she remarried.</span> <span id="s520">And I told you already that?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: No, you didn't say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I have two stepbrothers late in that life.</span> <span id="s523">By then, I had children so it wasn't so entertaining anymore.</span> <span id="s524">And they her husband and she bought a very small house in Florida, and she was very happy there.</span> <span id="s525">Loved the gardening.</span> <span id="s526">And it was very nice.</span> <span id="s527">Then we went down every Easter to visit and later on.</span> <span id="s528">We went down because she was sick.</span> <span id="s529">She had a heart condition, so I had to keep flying down and got another caretaker for her, and she was never comfortable or happy, and she didn't live very long.</span> <span id="s530">She didn't live to see her first grandchild greatgrandchild.</span> <span id="s531">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: That's unfortunate.</span> <span id="s533">Did you get to be any closer with her after she arrived to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Were you</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Again, she was fonder of my husband than she was of me.</span> <span id="s539">It kept it happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Did you correspond with her when you were in England?</span> <span id="s541">Did you correspond?</span> <span id="s542">Write letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Oh, I even went to Cambridge to visit with her.</span> <span id="s544">She's I didn't mention this, but anyhow, she was the world's worst cook, but she became a cook in England.</span> <span id="s545">Somebody some very welloff people, and she cooked from the cookbook.</span> <span id="s546">She could do that.</span> <span id="s547">And the lady came from somewhere in Germany also, and she said we saved onethirtieth of our fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Well, some people are still very welloff had a lovely house in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: That's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: So that's interesting too.</span> <span id="s552">We stayed in touch.</span> <span id="s553">When I came to America, I didn't write nearly as often as I should have.</span> <span id="s554">It wasn't a happy time.</span> <span id="s555">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s556">I dealt with it, but it wasn't a happy time.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Well, I can only try to imagine.</span> <span id="s558">You probably were all left to yourself, and you had to start your new life in America, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: And with all the I mean, it was such abrupt experiences from moving from Europe and, you know, leaving war behind.</span> <span id="s561">You mentioned that one person from your family was sent to a concentration camp, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: That was Tante Frieda, my mother's sister.</span> <span id="s563">She was in France and the French police took her.</span> <span id="s564">Really awful, really awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: But my uncle and his wife he was in one of the French camps in near Paris, but</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Did they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: They got out.</span> <span id="s569">He was the one who was supposed to meet me in New York, but he didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Oh, that's the one, that's the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: The other, they were family went to Stedishav (ph).</span> <span id="s572">One survived, and the others, I guess, were starved to death is my thinking.</span> <span id="s573">And this other uncle who took me to the railroad station, they came from Dunwich.</span> <span id="s574">So he and his family all survived.</span> <span id="s575">One of the cousins went through the war with her mother, and she got cancer.</span> <span id="s576">And I think, according to a story, she was raped by the Russians when they came in.</span> <span id="s577">So that's but you hear this you know, these stories did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Right, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: And she had a child apparently that was lost during that time, which is really worse than what happened to me, much.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: And there were four cousins, and we were all friends, and we went to for summer holidays, and they lived in Dunwich, and two of them are still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Do you keep in touch with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: I that's another story.</span> <span id="s584">I don't know if you've got time for those stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: I have lots of time as long as you have a little bit of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I have to eat lunch soon.</span> <span id="s587">I went to India, and I decided I had to go by way of London, and I was going to stop and visit with this cousin, and he picked me up at the airport and took me to a motel, and we visited.</span> <span id="s588">And the next day they gave me a very big treat.</span> <span id="s589">They took me to the British Museum, which I loved.</span> <span id="s590">This is fine.</span> <span id="s591">But while we're having a small snack, my bag was gone with everything, everything, everything you can imagine in it, mainly the passport and the VISA for in India, and it was really quite awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">And so we went from there to the American Embassy, Grosvenor Square, where they wouldn't let me in because I didn't have identification.</span> <span id="s593">Well, if I had identification, I wouldn't have to be there.</span> <span id="s594">So anyhow, finally somebody came out and let me in, and they started the process of giving me a temporary passport, and I had to go and get a picture taken, all that.</span> <span id="s595">It was a major mess.</span> <span id="s596">And then the next day I thought I would not be able to get into India because of British the Indian High Commission is closed, but it was open on Saturday.</span> <span id="s597">So I went there, another cousin took me, her sister, and I waited because he had to go and get money.</span> <span id="s598">For some reason or other, the banks were closed or something.</span> <span id="s599">I don't know.</span> <span id="s600">It could happen.</span> <span id="s601">And anyhow, I waited and waited and waited, and they got very tired of having me sit there, and I really wanted to get out of there.</span> <span id="s602">So eventually I got the VISA into my new passport.</span> <span id="s603">And then, the next day I was going to India and the plane was supposed to leave at 8:00 9:00 in the morning, but it didn't leave until 6:30 in the afternoon, so I sat at the airport for many hours, and my cousin brought some money so I could buy a lipstick and a comb.</span> <span id="s604">You know, this is basics.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s607">Anyhow, I didn't have glasses.</span> <span id="s608">I didn't have hearing aids.</span> <span id="s609">I didn't have my address book.</span> <span id="s610">I didn't have my house keys for when I came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: This was it's nothing to do with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s613">It's just a major catastrophe that affected me deeply.</span> <span id="s614">Then I went to India and the group leaders had money so they advanced me money, then at the end I sent them a check.</span> <span id="s615">That can be done.</span> <span id="s616">And I sent my cousin money, but he had a special arrangement and didn't want to lose any money on the deal.</span> <span id="s617">Anyhow, it all worked out.</span> <span id="s618">India was interesting.</span> <span id="s619">Very cold.</span> <span id="s620">We were there in January up near the Himalayas.</span> <span id="s621">Which has nothing to do with what you're interviewing me with.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: So I was asking about your cousins, but I guess you do keep in touch with your cousins, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: This story has something to do with this.</span> <span id="s624">I get this Kinderlink.</span> <span

Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I have one more question if you wouldn't mind answering it.</span> <span id="s663">It's probably, I don't know, maybe a little bit more personal than the other questions.</span> <span id="s664">I wanted to ask if you think that do you think that being on the Kinderstransport had I mean, I've heard different stories so far.</span> <span id="s665">Did it have

<p><span id="s742">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s743">I have no idea what how that worked at that time.</span> <span id="s744">For all I know, I didn't take a shower in six, seven days.</span> <span id="s745">It's possible.</span> <span id="s746">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So the trip took six, seven days only?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A:

occasions.</span> <span id="s791">As a child, I went to Sweden, and I was so seasick.</span> <span id="s792">It was also an interesting holiday except when I came back to Berlin, my grandfather had died, and that was really major trauma.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: So he died before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Before you went on

the escalating atmosphere in Berlin, how things were changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Well, you can read the StÃ¼rmer while you were waiting for the bus or the trolley or whatever because they had these horrible articles and pictures.</span> <span id="s800">I was standing there waiting so I read them.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: So you were let's say, you were probably between 12 around 12, right, when you started reading these?</span> <span id="s802">You were born</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yeah, I must have been maybe yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: What year

wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Did your parents manage to</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: My mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Your mother, right.</span> <span id="s815">Did your mother manage to, I guess, secure some of your savings I don't know possessions, or did that all get lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Actually, it all got lost.</span> <span id="s817">Except we were allowed you know that from other people.</span> <span id="s818">We were allowed one two sets of silverware per person.</span> <span id="s819">So my mother took two, and I took two, and the mitchen (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: The nanny, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: The only Jewish maid in Berlin, she brought two over two too, and I gave them to my granddaughter when she had a shower when she got married.</span> <span id="s822">She may never use them.</span> <span id="s823">They're very the end of the blades should be replaced, and the anyhow, with other things, we did not later on my mother brought some more books, and I still have a lot of the books in German that I had read and</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: And I'm sure you probably still speak very good German, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I can read German.</span> <span id="s826">I can speak German better.</span> <span id="s827">Last did I tell you that yet?</span> <span id="s828">Last March I was in Eilat.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: No, I don't believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: And on a birding trip, and there was a very nice young man who led a German group.</span> <span id="s831">And when I told him he spoke fluent English.</span> <span id="s832">And when I told him that I was born in Berlin, Landhaus Striesen.</span> <span id="s833">He said he lives two blocks from there.</span> <span id="s834">Anyhow, there were many German people there, French and English.</span> <span id="s835">Lots of English, Russians, Poles, they were all holidaying in on the Red Sea, and they left.</span> <span id="s836">And there was this guy's twin sister and there was many and I decided I never speak German anymore for obvious reasons, there's nobody to speak German with or to.</span> <span id="s837">So with them I started singing old little Whoop De Doo songs and stuff like that, and I was surprised that I remembered.</span> <span id="s838">But in 19 I forget, before the wall came down, must have been '88, we went to Germany because Berlin invited us.</span> <span id="s839">I wasn't going to go, but then my husband hadn't been there so it was an invitation, so we went.</span> <span id="s840">And surprising thing was the words that came back to me that I hadn't used in years</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: A long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: and years, you know.</span> <span id="s843">And so, we went to Berlin and they treated us very nicely, and we ate the stuff that I used to look.</span> <span id="s844">Like audilgoza.</span> <span id="s845">Q: I think I know what that is.</span> <span id="s846">That's currants.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Oh, it's yummy.</span> <span id="s848">What else did they have?</span> <span id="s849">Oh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s850">It was okay.</span> <span id="s851">And they took us to the opera and the Berlin Philharmonic and play.</span> <span id="s852">And then they asked us if I wanted to meet a German couple.</span> <span id="s853">I said no, that's all right.</span> <span id="s854">No, thank you.</span> <span id="s855">If you want to do something for me, I said take me birding.</span> <span id="s856">And they took me to a forest, and there was a man who was a birder, and he asked me what do you want to see, and I said everything.</span> <span id="s857">So we had an extremely nice morning.</span> <span id="s858">My husband didn't go.</span> <span id="s859">He wasn't up to that kind of stuff and that was very nice.</span> <span id="s860">I had a wonderful time.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Well, that's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Very nice.</span> <span id="s863">And then we did meet the German couple because they had listened to me.</span> <span id="s864">And they were lovely people.</span> <span id="s865">They were adolish (ph).</span> <span id="s866">Do you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: That's an eagle, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Von.</span> <span id="s869">The name inbetween the first and second name.</span> <span id="s870">There's a VON.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Oh, Von, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Nobility.</span> <span id="s873">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s874">They gave us tea and cake.</span> <span id="s875">And then which stayed in touch a little bit by mail after that.</span> <span id="s876">And after Berlin, we went to we flew to Munich, and we rented a car, and we drove through the Bavaria a little bit and then to northeastern Switzerland where they speak German because that used to be Austria, and we had a holiday there.</span> <span id="s877">And then we drove through Switzerland no, this was in Italy, sorry.</span> <span id="s878">Wrong country.</span> <span id="s879">Italy.</span> <span id="s880">We drove to Switzerland and Frankfurt, and I wanted to get back because it was May, and I wanted to start to bird again.</span> <span id="s881">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Did you get to see your old house in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And was it very emotional?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No.</span> <span id="s886">It was pink, and I know our house was never pink.</span> <span id="s887">They must have repainted it.</span> <span id="s888">But we went to another place where we had lived later, and we looked at it.</span> <span id="s889">My husband wasn't comfortable then.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: He wasn't.</span> <span id="s891">And you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Well, it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Reluctantly, mmhmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: It was okay.</span> <span id="s895">And we went to another house nearby where we had moved to afterwards, and the same magnolia tree was still there.</span> <span id="s896">It was a nice house.</span> <span id="s897">Again, we lived in apartments.</span> <span id="s898">Like here, everybody has a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s900">In Europe, it's not so, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Especially not</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: I think I should let you let me go because they want to go, and I think I have to eat my lunch and leave with them.</span> <span id="s904">I'm dependent on my chauffeur.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Thank you so much for the interview.</span> <span id="s906">I really appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
