id="s17">Q: Tell me about your parents and your family, before the war.</span> <span id="s18">I want to know about your childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: OK.</span> <span id="s20">Uh my

brothers...I was the younger...was uh born in uh, my brother Otto was born in 1920 and my older brother was born in 1914.</span> <span id="s22">(cough) We uh...let's see...went to school of course.</span> <span id="s23">High school later and college in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s24">In 1939 war broke out...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Let's not...let's stop...let's not go quite there.</span> <span id="s26">I want to know a little more.</span> <span id="s27">Tell me, tell me about your home life.</span> <span id="s28">What was it like?</span> <span id="s29">Did it make a difference to you, being part Jewish and part non-Jewish?</span> <span id="s30">How were you brought up?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s32">Not really.</span> <span id="s33">As a matter of fact, uh I would say that uh most of uh my friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s34">Uh my father being Jewish uh we were raised uh more or less...my mother, of course, converted to Judaism and uh so therefore we were raised in uh Jewish spirits.</span> <span id="s35">And uh I would say most of my friends were Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s36">(cough)</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What kind of things did you do as a as young as a young boy, as a child...uh the school you went to.</span> <span id="s38">Tell us something about the school you went to and the friends you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Went to school, as I say, went to high school in uh my home town, in Novisad and uh in summertime, vacations we used to take of course every year.</span> <span id="s40">We went to the Dalmatian coast uh and uh Switzerland uh in the uh 1930's as a kid, uh which was beautiful of course.</span> <span id="s41">And uh we had a governess in uh my home so uh at an early age we were uh taught speaking German besides of course Hungarian, which was my uh sort of mother tongue.</span> <span id="s42">My mom spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s43">My father spoke Hungarian and then of course in school we started uh learning Yugoslav uh language, Serbian or Yugoslav, so as a kid we spoke uh three languages and then uh we had a governess in the house to...French...we learned French from a Russian tutor.</span> <span id="s44">We had a lot of Russian immigrants from the Czar times in Yugoslavia and they were teaching French.</span> <span id="s45">They all spoke French fluently so we spoke French also.</span> <span id="s46">English I hadn't spoken as a young kid and I started much later in my 20's.</span> <span id="s47">I had a teacher in uh Budapest.</span> <span id="s48">As a matter of fact, an Englishman... took my first lessons.</span> <span id="s49">Later on, of course, I learned more and then came to the States, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did you...what what was it like being a Jew in Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Uh, I would say you didn't really feel it, being a Jew.</span> <span id="s52">There was uh in in Novisad itself you...there was no anti-Semitism to speak of.</span> <span id="s53">We had a beautiful temple.</span> <span id="s54">Matter of fact uh the synagogue was uh one of the nicest synagogues I've every seen.</span> <span id="s55">Old synagogue, which incidentally was uh built by my mother's father who was an architect, gentile.</span> <span id="s56">Indeed, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s57">It was separated for women, (ph).</span> <span id="s58">It was just a beautiful, beautiful building.</span> <span id="s59">It was never destroyed by the way during the war.</span> <span id="s60">The Hungarians came in.</span> <span id="s61">They never destroyed it.</span> <span id="s62">As far as I know it still stands.</span> <span id="s63">But, of course, there's uh...now there's there's no, hardly any Jewish left in...I don't know what they're using the building for, but it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s64">And as I say, as a child we didn't know what it meant to be uh Jew or non- Jew...they're all mixed and uh it was really a very normal life.</span> <span id="s65">A very healthy and beautiful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: When did this start to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Well, of course, it started to change as a matter of fact even...let's see...in school when Hitler started, you know, in '36 and then '37.</span> <span id="s68">We had in my class in high school we had some uh native Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s69">They called them schwabs (ph).</span> <span id="s70">The German minorities and they already started, you know, uh sort of uh secretively first uh German sympathizers and uh talking loud and proud, you know, about the Germany and Hitler and you started feeling a certain extent already uh but uh even then it wasn't too bad, but of course when the war broke out...let's see...in '39...I would say...let's see...in '39...then in '41 it was not too bad in in my town, but when in '41 the Hungarian army came in and occupied uh the territory...there was northern part of Yugoslavia where I lived...Voivodina, and uh then uh of course when they came in they started uh...we were, as I..</span> <span id="s71">.</span> <span id="s72">well...as I said I was half-Jew, right.</span> <span id="s73">But they were, regardless, the half-Jews and the Jews uh had to go to camps, to labor camps in uh the surrounding areas.</span> <span id="s74">Just working every day, but we came home at night.</span> <span id="s75">The real trouble started in 1942.</span> <span id="s76">In 1942, we heard some rumors...it was in January.</span> <span id="s77">It was a very cold winter, one of the coldest we ever had.</span> <span id="s78">If I recall it was like uh...with the celsius now, twenty-three below zero which was terrible.</span> <span id="s79">The Danube River was frozen and we heard some rumors that uh Hungarian gendarmes are murdering Jews in the neighborhood cities.</span> <span id="s80">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s81">We said it's just, it's just rumors.</span> <span id="s82">Nobody took it very seriously.</span> <span id="s83">And on the 23rd of January, there was a proclamation over the radio that no Jews or half-Jews can leave their homes.</span> <span id="s84">Everybody has to stay home.</span> <span id="s85">Still didn't realize what this all meant, but of course we couldn't leave.</span> <span id="s86">Then sometime in the morning uh my neighbor's, maid came over.</span> <span id="s87">She was a Hungarian girl.</span> <span id="s88">She walked across the street and she come to my house and she said that she heard some rumors.</span> <span id="s89">They saw some vans, some big trucks, and they saw blood in the trucks.</span> <span id="s90">So we still didn't realize.</span> <span id="s91">We still this...this is rumors.</span> <span id="s92">Must have been cattle or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Then I remember around eleven o'clock in the morning, the doorbell rang.</span> <span id="s94">If I recall I opened the door...there was three Hungarian gendarmes and uh...OK...they opened the door.</span> <span id="s95">They came in.</span> <span id="s96">The first thing they did...uh we had a maid also...first thing they asked the maid - how is your boss?</span> <span id="s97">How are they treating you?</span> <span id="s98">And she said, oh, very fine.</span> <span id="s99">Then they came into the house.</span> <span id="s100">They spoke to my father.</span> <span id="s101">One of the officers went in to the library.</span> <span id="s102">We had a big library, a lot of Hungarian books.</span> <span id="s103">Oh, he says...you are Hungarian.</span> <span id="s104">He said yeah, you know, we're not Hungarian.</span> <span id="s105">We read Hungarian literature and as a matter of fact I have uh a cousin in in in Budapest who's in the Hungarian army, which happened to be true.</span> <span id="s106">Not that it meant too much, but uh...and I still didn't realize the danger.</span> <span id="s107">I didn't know what's happening in the city, you know...what's going on.</span> <span id="s108">And they asked a few more questions.</span> <span id="s109">They talked to my mother.</span> <span id="s110">Dadada.</span> <span id="s111">And they left.</span> <span id="s112">So that was all.</span> <span id="s113">So we didn't know.</span> <span id="s114">A few minutes later my aunt, my mother's sister, who's also gentile but her husband was Jewish...she came over crying.</span> <span id="s115">They took her husband away.</span> <span id="s116">So, so we didn't know.</span> <span id="s117">We still...you start worrying but you still don't know what's happening.</span> <span id="s118">And in the evening, that evening, we heard rumors that people were getting killed and actually those trucks were carrying people and the blood was human blood.</span> <span id="s119">Well next morning we found out what happened...about uh fifteen to two thousand Jews were murdered, including...my uncle across the street was not murdered.</span> <span id="s120">He was saved luckily.</span> <span id="s121">He was already down on the Danube River being ready to shot and at the last minute came an order from Budapest, from Horthy's uh headquarters, to stop the the killings.</span> <span id="s122">But another uncle, another aunt...uh two uncles matter of fact, two aunts, their daughter, everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s123">They were taken down to the Danube River, shot and thrown into the river.</span> <span id="s124">They had to dug a hole because as I said it was frozen.</span> <span id="s125">Then it was frozen so they had to dug a hole and throw the bodies into the river.</span> <span id="s126">The only survivor was the dog.</span> <span id="s127">Their little dog was crying the next day...we went over there to see what happened and the table was all set for lunch.</span> <span id="s128">The food, everything was on the table...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s129">The dog crying.</span> <span id="s130">And then you heard the stories.</span> <span id="s131">Then you heard, this was killed, who was killed, what was killed.</span> <span id="s132">Some people were not taken to the Danube like down the street there was a house, a good friend of mine who was my teacher at one time...they were killed in the house.</span> <span id="s133">Shot from close range.</span> <span id="s134">And then, you know, we heard that this friend and this friend was killed and we didn't know about the Serbs (ph) yet.</span> <span id="s135">Then we heard that the Serbs were killed also.</span> <span id="s136">A lot of Serbs, a lot of Serbs were killed.</span> <span id="s137">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s138">It was January 23rd, 1942, but that was only one day that they did the killing in my town.</span> <span id="s139">And then everything stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Then a few days later we decided to leave my hometown, Novisad, and we went to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, and there life was still quite normal.</span> <span id="s141">We lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s142">My aunt lived there, who was gentile and uh my uncle of course and her family and we uh uh rented an apartment house in Budapest and uh lived there oh quite normally for about uh I would say nine months, ten months.</span> <span id="s143">Then uh one day they said...again it was in the papers... everybody who is Jewish or half-Jewish, you know, has to register...police department I remember.</span> <span id="s144">And I went down.</span> <span id="s145">I registered.</span> <span id="s146">They said that uh in a few days we have to leave.</span> <span id="s147">They didn't say exactly where in a certain camp and then when we went down there we got a white band so that distinguished you from a full Jew, from a hundred percent Jew...the white band.</span> <span id="s148">No star.</span> <span id="s149">Just a white band.</span> <span id="s150">And then we were taken, we were transported to uh a Hungarian town, Hajduhatasza (ph) was the name...about uh oh hundred kilometers uh south from Budapest.</span> <span id="s151">Was a camp sort of.</span> <span id="s152">We worked there.</span> <span id="s153">Hard work, unloading uh railroad cars, building railroad tracks, you know, and uh just work everyday.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">We had food.</span> <span id="s155">We had food.</span> <span id="s156">It it wasn't really bad.</span> <span id="s157">I was uh I can honestly say that at that time we were not really suffering there.</span> <span id="s158">However, uh in the very beginning as a matter of fact we were even permitted to go back to Budapest on the weekend, you know, to see our parents and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What was Budapest like at that time...when you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Normal.</span> <span id="s161">Normal life.</span> <span id="s162">Budapest was still normal life.</span> <span id="s163">And uh the Jewish were still living, you know, in pretty normal circumstances.</span> <span id="s164">And then I uh recall one time when we went home on a weekend, I saw a train coming from Budapest and it stopped at the station next to our train...see, and...let me see now...that was the year after, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s165">Now the year after, when I was still going home and this train was coming, and it was full of people, and at first we didn't know...it was all locked up, the train...you know, those cattle, cattle cars.</span> <span id="s166">It was locked up and we saw people in the windows and crying and asking for water...then we realized...Jews from Budapest, transported, you know, to Poland.</span> <span id="s167">We didn't know where they were going, you know...we found out later.</span> <span id="s168">They are taking them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s169">It was a horrible sight.</span> <span id="s170">Uh and as I say, then after one year we couldn't, of course they stopped us going back.</span> <span id="s171">They said we couldn't go back any more to Budapest, and I was in the camp and from then on...that was...let's see...from '42 to '44, but uh we you know, we were moved from that area to another area which was near the Romanian border.</span> <span id="s172">Also same type of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Luckily we had a pretty good commander.</span> <span id="s174">Our commander was a pretty nice guy so uh we were not uh really suffering too much.</span> <span id="s175">Some camps were worse off than ours.</span> <span id="s176">In uh...let me see now...this is '44.</span> <span id="s177">Yeah, and then one day of course I heard uh the the German troops, of course, the German troops were going through our village and uh one day uh a German train stopped and I was talking to this uh German officer...spoke German, of course...and uh asked him what's going on and he told me he just heard that uh the Americans landed.</span> <span id="s178">It was June 6th, 1944.</span> <span id="s179">But he says we aren't worried.</span> <span id="s180">He says, you know, we are very confident, he said.</span> <span id="s181">And of course he didn't know who I was really so he was talking to me like nothing was going to happen, you know.</span> <span id="s182">Was in 1944.</span> <span id="s183">Uh now uh about uh...let's see...a few months later, see as the Russian armies were getting now closer already to that area, I had a friend of mine, an older...about seven or eight years older than I was...told me that uh one of these days now, Cornel, he says we are going to escape.</span> <span id="s184">We cannot stay here any longer, because eventually they're going to take us from here to some place else and, you know, we don't know what's going to happen, so we cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s185">You know, his plans where to take me with him to his hometown, escape and go to his hometown and, of course, he knew that I spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s186">And uh in fact the Russian army was coming.</span> <span id="s187">He, he ......for selfish reasons but more that he knew that I'm going to be able to communicate with the Russians and which is going to help him indirectly.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: What was it like for you at that time in the camp (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No.</span> <span id="s190">Not really.</span> <span id="s191">Not really, because I think that the commander knew that the Russians are...of course, he knew, he knew that the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s192">It was obvious.</span> <span id="s193">And he figured if he is nice to us, it's going to be better for him you see.</span> <span id="s194">So uh, which was true in a way.</span> <span id="s195">But anyway, so this uh friend of mine, one day uh we were told that the train is going to pull out, oh in about three or four hours and go to some other destination.</span> <span id="s196">Didn't know where but anyway we're leaving this this place.</span> <span id="s197">So he told me...he says, Cornel - the train pulls out - we're going to stay here and escape at night.</span> <span id="s198">And uh the train started pulling out...for a moment I was hesitating because I tried to stay with my younger, you know, friends, with my own age friends, but he pulled my arm.</span> <span id="s199">Stay.</span> <span id="s200">And we stayed and the train pulled out.</span> <span id="s201">We, of course, left the place right away and we went in to the countryside.</span> <span id="s202">Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s203">And we took, of course, the bands off but we still didn't look like Hungarian farmers, so uh, you know, you were not a hundred percent safe.</span> <span id="s204">Anyway, we went to the country side and we went off the road, off the highway because the highway was dangerous because, you know, the the German troops...they were already retreating and the Hungarians, but they were going on the highways.</span> <span id="s205">And besides uh Russian planes were coming and bombing the highways, so we went off the road and uh we were hiding somewhere, you know, in the grass and I remember, at one time they said these troops, the Hungarian troops...they stopped on the highway and the Hungarian...some of the soldiers were coming towards us because we were near a little lake or something, and they were coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s206">So my friend said now let's act very normally and calm, because uh...and they came, they saw us and they said uh, what what are you guys doing here.</span> <span id="s207">I said we missed our train.</span> <span id="s208">We sold them a bill, bill of goods, you know, and they believed it, fortunately.</span> <span id="s209">So later on at night when the sun went down we saw a Romanian...there was a a part of Romania see at that time...we saw a Romanian farmer and we called him closer and said uh please...we didn't speak Romanian but he understood...and says, you know, try to hide us.</span> <span id="s210">We have to uh get away, and he did take us in, fortunately.</span> <span id="s211">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s212">He took us in and we were hiding in his little farm there for about uh three days.</span> <span id="s213">He was feeding us OK and we heard the Russians, you know, the cannons, getting closer and closer and uh he says when when...today...tomorrow, you know...and he told us that the Russians are celebrating a few miles away, but they're not coming yet.</span> <span id="s214">They're still not here, so he can't let us loose see.</span> <span id="s215">And oh I think next morning he comes up.</span> <span id="s216">He says the Russian and the Romanian soldiers are here so we are safe.</span> <span id="s217">It's OK.</span> <span id="s218">So we came down from our hiding place and the first thing, the first Romanian soldier I met took my watch, took my shoes, which were not too good but obviously looked better than his...oh yes...you know...we figured liberated, you know, they're going to put their arms around us...anyway, but we were free.</span> <span id="s219">We knew we were free.</span> <span id="s220">So then we started walking back to his hometown, which was as I say from there perhaps about eighty, ninety, hundred miles.</span> <span id="s221">But this guy had these shoes with a nail in his shoes and (laughter) it was not easy to walk but there was not too much transportation and uh as we were walking, of course, we passed Russians and at one time we came to a crossroad and uh some Russians soldiers standing there.</span> <span id="s222">And I saw an officer and he looked sort of like could have been Jewish...I wasn't sure but I talked to him, and he says, I'm Jewish, he says.</span> <span id="s223">But he says don't say anything because the soldiers don't know that I'm Jewish, said the Jewish officer.</span> <span id="s224">The Russian soldiers don't know and doesn't want it to be known, and you don't say anything either.</span> <span id="s225">And uh another time also I met some Russians and they they asked...first thing they asked, they said who are you.</span> <span id="s226">I said Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s227">Oh.</span> <span id="s228">Says well how come you're not in Yugoslavia fighting?</span> <span id="s229">How come you're here?</span> <span id="s230">See, they didn't know what was going on really.</span> <span id="s231">So I told him...I said I was in a camp and I was in a forced labor camp and you know, I I just ran away.</span> <span id="s232">So we managed and later on as a matter of fact we were lucky enough to uh get on a Russian truck and uh they took us to his hometown.</span> <span id="s233">So we wound up in his hometown which was a small, Hungarian town.</span> <span id="s234">It was like normal times.</span> <span id="s235">Food, everything.</span> <span id="s236">Plenty.</span> <span id="s237">Plenty.</span> <span id="s238">There was no problem.</span> <span id="s239">Of course his wife, she was gentile and they were still all there.</span> <span id="s240">Everything was fine and I stayed uh there for about two, three months I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">And then I heard...somebody came from Budapest and I found out that my parents who lived in Budapest are still alive.</span> <span id="s242">And everything is, you know, it's OK there.</span> <span id="s243">And about a week later I uh, with a Russian transport, I went to Budapest and as I arrived in Budapest, it was one day after liberation.</span> <span id="s244">People were still on the street of course.</span> <span id="s245">People are uh dying and smoke all over and they came to our truck and they said give us bread for anything...gold, you know, jewelry.</span> <span id="s246">They are starving.</span> <span id="s247">People are starving on the street.</span> <span id="s248">You could still hear the cannons and everything because the Germans just left Budapest, you know, the day before (cough) and then uh, of course I went to my parent's house.</span> <span id="s249">I found out where they live.</span> <span id="s250">I came to my parents.</span> <span id="s251">You can imagine the reunion.</span> <span id="s252">Fantastic.</span> <span id="s253">Because you know my mother didn't know exactly you see what happened to me.</span> <span id="s254">My uh...then I found out of course about my uh older brother who was in Yugoslavia, in in Serbia, with the Mihajlovic army, that he was killed the year before, uh May 8th, 1944, yeah...he died.</span> <span id="s255">Uh let's see, then uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Tell us about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Oh, OK.</span> <span id="s258">I want I want to tell you some more incidents here in Budapest.</span> <span id="s259">It was quite interesting.</span> <span id="s260">Uh the Russians, they...I uh I..</span> <span id="s261">.</span> <span id="s262">they fortunately didn't happen, but it could have happened they were surrounding people on the street... surrounding...just people, you know, and taking them in some...I think the church yard or something...and I I I smelled something wrong.</span> <span id="s263">Something is fishy, so I asked one of the Russian officers there, what's happening.</span> <span id="s264">He said, oh nothing.</span> <span id="s265">They're just going to interrogate people.</span> <span id="s266">I didn't like the idea so I asked him...I said can you do me a favor.</span> <span id="s267">I'm a Russian uh interpreter and I'm working...which was true...I'm working for a Russian officer and he's at this and this address.</span> <span id="s268">Would you please tell him to come over here and pick me up.</span> <span id="s269">Fortunately he went, and he did pick him up and the Russian officer came and he told the commander in the yard that uh he needs me very badly and he has to release me and he did release me.</span> <span id="s270">He saved my life.</span> <span id="s271">The rest of the people were taken to Russia.</span> <span id="s272">A lot of them never came back.</span> <span id="s273">Yeah...horrible.</span> <span id="s274">Now you asked me about my mother, because my mother during the war...as I said, she was in Budapest.</span> <span id="s275">She was gentile.</span> <span id="s276">Her sister was a full Hungarian, a full-blooded gentile.</span> <span id="s277">My mom lived with my aunt and she had a lot of Jewish friends in Budapest.</span> <span id="s278">She managed to save them.</span> <span id="s279">She took those friends to my aunt's house, and they were hidden in the cellar which was, of course, a very dangerous thing to do.</span> <span id="s280">If they would have found out, it would have been, meant, you know, the end for everybody.</span> <span id="s281">But uh...there was one place and she saved some people in another place also and she was commuting between those two places...yeah...and giving the news.</span> <span id="s282">She heard the news over the radio and giving messages and food for several months it was.</span> <span id="s283">Because of course as you know, as you remember in in Budapest it was the last two months when the Jewish people were really taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s284">I can't remember how many but it was the last four or five months of the war, and she saved uh quite a few uh families, my mom.</span> <span id="s285">And of course after the war uh we had uh, it was a big affair in in Los Angeles in uh I believe it was Century Plaza and she was honored as a righteous Christian.</span> <span id="s286">George Pottman (ph) was the MC at that time, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Dark days (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s289">Dark days.</span> <span id="s290">Dark days in our history.</span> <span id="s291">Now of course Mom died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s292">She lived to be 94 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you ever meet up with the families, any of the people she had saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Uh, as a matter of fact...no.</span> <span id="s295">No, I did not.</span> <span id="s296">I did not.</span> <span id="s297">I tell you why...because uh uh after the war I I left Budapest.</span> <span id="s298">You see, I decided uh, my brother came to the States in 1938, so he was already here, you know, for many many years, and my plans were to leave uh Hungary regardless...we were told it's not going to be good.</span> <span id="s299">He says leave as soon as you can.</span> <span id="s300">So...but it was not legal of course, so you couldn't get a passport or visa or anything like that.</span> <span id="s301">You had to run away.</span> <span id="s302">So I..</span> <span id="s303">.</span> <span id="s304">so this friend of mine, we got together...we were together in camp by the way with this friend, an old friend of mine...we got together and we made up our minds we're going to leave Budapest and we crossed the border at night, the Hungarian-Austrian border, that's right.</span> <span id="s305">And then we went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s306">And we were in Vienna for a few weeks and then from Vienna we went to Linz, Austria and Linz had two camps...two, two camps for the refugees you see.</span> <span id="s307">And uh that's where I met Marsha, my wife...that's right.</span> <span id="s308">In one of those camps I met Marsha.</span> <span id="s309">Strange coincidence.</span> <span id="s310">She came from another part of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">She came from this part of the world and uh in 19...let me see...in '40...I went there in '46 and I met Marsha in later, later part of '46 and we were married in '47 and then we came to the States in 1949, from from Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Tell us about coming to the States, and about your life here.</span> <span id="s313">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Tell us about coming to the States and your early years here.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s316">Well, of course we arrived here in 1949.</span> <span id="s317">As I say, my brother was here so we didn't have to wait too long to...fortunately because he was here so we didn't we didn't need any special permits at that time and it took us just about a few months.</span> <span id="s318">Oh, I meant to tell you also that because my wife's, Marsha's father survived and he lived, yes, he lived with us in Austria also, in in Linz.</span> <span id="s319">He tried but he couldn't come to the States.</span> <span id="s320">He went to Canada with his wife, and uh we went here and came to New Orleans.</span> <span id="s321">Uh arrived in New Orleans and we were uh received by a Jewish organization and very well in New Orleans.</span> <span id="s322">Uh I want to tell you the trip was very rough coming to the States of course.</span> <span id="s323">I mean by rough I got seasick.</span> <span id="s324">(laughter) Still better than a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s325">And uh couldn't eat too much food on the boat.</span> <span id="s326">Uh in New Orleans we were received by this Jewish organization, stayed about two days in New Orleans and we came by train to Los Angeles where my parents lived in Los Angeles already.</span> <span id="s327">See my mom and dad, they came to uh California in uh, I think in '47 and they awaited us of course with my brother and my uh his wife at that time.</span> <span id="s328">And we settled down pretty fast.</span> <span id="s329">It was a different world of course.</span> <span id="s330">A new world.</span> <span id="s331">A strange world in the beginning for us but it was freedom.</span> <span id="s332">Liberty.</span> <span id="s333">It was a new start, a new beginning.</span> <span id="s334">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s335">Many many years ago of course...pardon me...I got a job in the beginning.</span> <span id="s336">First I worked in a motel on Sunset Strip for a while and then uh my brother had a good friend here and he had a shop with optical instruments and I got a job there and I worked there for a few years working for him and settled down and my wife then had a job also.</span> <span id="s337">She worked uh on the Sunset Strip also in a knit shop.</span> <span id="s338">She was uh handwork...she inherited from her...her father was a great tailor and Marsha inherited that obviously from her dad and she was great with her hands.</span> <span id="s339">She was uh...those times, those days I mean they were embroidering sweaters, you know, in mode and then she was working for this girl Suzie, named Suzie, on the Strip.</span> <span id="s340">She had a famous shop and she worked for them.</span> <span id="s341">She met a lot of movie stars there too.</span> <span id="s342">I think Zsa Zsa was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Cornelius, how do you think the war has affected you, changed your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: It's uh hard to say.</span> <span id="s345">As I say, uh I didn't suffer too much during the war.</span> <span id="s346">I didn't go through real hell like uh my wife did, you're going to hear later.</span> <span id="s347">The good, uh nice childhood, uh nice memories, you know...they say good home.</span> <span id="s348">Even after the war everything was uh in good shape.</span> <span id="s349">Well-adjusted so to speak.</span> <span id="s350">Family was, like parents, of course were alive, survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Brother in California.</span> <span id="s352">It was pretty normal, pretty normal I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Is there anything you want to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: What I was going to say...I don't know if this is interesting uh but in uh Los Angeles just a few months ago, we uh formed a new society with the Serbs, uh a Serbian-Jewish society which uh because you know the Serbian people had lots in common with the Jews.</span> <span id="s355">As you see their their destiny is uh the same and uh the the Serbs went through a lot of suffering through centuries also.</span> <span id="s356">So did the Jews, of course.</span> <span id="s357">And this society we just formed is growing.</span> <span id="s358">It's going to grow more and more and of course we...part of it is in in Yugoslavia also...you see, it started in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s359">We formed it but there is a group in Yugoslavia, in in Belgrade.</span> <span id="s360">As a matter of fact uh Professor Tabidge (ph) was here from Yugoslavia with his wife, you know, when we organized this whole committee, so they're carrying it on there.</span> <span id="s361">And it's I think a great idea.</span> <span id="s362">As a matter of fact...yeah...we have some members from Canada also.</span> <span id="s363">As a matter of fact I met a gentleman the other day...he was very proud to show his card.</span> <span id="s364">He says I just joined the Society.</span> <span id="s365">So it's going to be quite uh, quite interesting.</span> <span id="s366">It will grow more and more.</span> <span id="s367">Unfortunately we was told uh it was told the other day that uh one of our members, the Prince Andrew of Yugoslavia who is the youngest son of uh King Alexander who lived in San Diego, had a residence in San Diego, and he came to our uh meeting about nine weeks ago and joined the group, and a few days ago I found out that he died unexpectedly.</span> <span id="s368">He was 62 years old.</span> <span id="s369">We don't know how and why and what happened, don't know the circumstances yet.</span> <span id="s370">Sad news.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
