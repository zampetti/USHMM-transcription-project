Long.</span> <span id="s5">I was born June 15, 1937 in Brocourt, France.</span> <span id="s6">My father was born in Romania.</span> <span id="s7">Hr came to Paris to study medicine.</span> <span id="s8">My mother was born in Siberia.</span> <span id="s9">She came also to Paris to study medicine.</span> <span id="s10">That’s where they met and married.</span> <span id="s11">After medical ---</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Could you please give their names and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My father’s name is Joseph Valman, April 19, 1913.</span> <span id="s14">My mother is Fanny Fooks and she was born August 28, 1910.</span> <span id="s15">They married in Paris after they finished school and they were looking for a place to practice medicine because both of them were poor.</span> <span id="s16">They chose a village in the north of France.</span> <span id="s17">When they arrived there, it was 1935 and there was something in the air.</span> <span id="s18">They felt that it was not very safe to announce they were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Can you explain, did they tell you what the ‘something in the air’, what it was ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No, I think they were ---.</span> <span id="s21">Well, my mother especially had been in Russia in Shetow______ during the revolution.</span> <span id="s22">Her parents were wealthy merchants and when the revolution, they had to run abandoning property, several property in Shetow.</span> <span id="s23">Just run with my grandmother’s jewelry.</span> <span id="s24">I think she felt from that time a lot of fear and was extremely suspicious of people.</span> <span id="s25">I assume that when she started hearing about what was going on in Germany, that she started to fear that it might spread and kept being Jewish a secret.</span> <span id="s26">She was not religious.</span> <span id="s27">To her I think, being Jewish didn’t mean very much.</span> <span id="s28">I have no idea what my father thought.</span> <span id="s29">But I know that they did not have any record that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s30">When I was born in ’37, the priest, I think they told the priest -- he gave us a full certificate of baptism.</span> <span id="s31">I went to church from the time I went to school, I think.</span> <span id="s32">From the age of five or so until at least ---, throughout the whole war and maybe after.</span> <span id="s33">I don’t think they ever really thought about being Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So you didn’t know when you were growing up that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s36">No, I was going to church.</span> <span id="s37">I don’t -- even I -- I think I may have known we were Jews because I suspect my parents talked about it around me.</span> <span id="s38">Because -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s39">I suspect I may have had some notion but I don’t know that it meant very much to me, what being a Jew is except it’s dangerous.</span> <span id="s40">But that -- yeah, I went to church.</span> <span id="s41">I went to Catholic church and that was my religion.</span> <span id="s42">That’s what the God I believed in there.</span> <span id="s43">That’s how I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: But were your parents churchgoers also?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No, they never went to church.</span> <span id="s46">It was not terribly unusual for the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: So you were two in 1939 and you were three in 1940.</span> <span id="s48">You don’t have any memories of being -- German ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s50">Oh yes, because the Germans lived with us in our village.</span> <span id="s51">We were occupied.</span> <span id="s52">I have a memo here of singing Oh Tannenbaum to the Germans.</span> <span id="s53">The first thing they did when they came to the village -- we lived in a sort of -- we had a big house, ____ big ,made of brick.</span> <span id="s54">It was attached to another house, similar, to the left.</span> <span id="s55">So we were -- we had those two houses touching each other.</span> <span id="s56">In the house to the left, lived an old lady.</span> <span id="s57">I think after a while, the Germans took her house and made her go away.</span> <span id="s58">I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s59">I remember she had a garden with flowers and we had a vegetable garden, not much flowers.</span> <span id="s60">She had all flowers.</span> <span id="s61">So that I was close to the Germans, of course, because they were in the same yard.</span> <span id="s62">I mean we shared the yard.</span> <span id="s63">There was no wall.</span> <span id="s64">I remember my mother telling me not to eat the candies they gave me because they might be poisoned.</span> <span id="s65">Of course, to me it didn’t make much sense.</span> <span id="s66">I guess, none of it made very much sense.</span> <span id="s67">I don’t remember being afraid especially of the Germans -- I remember the uniforms.</span> <span id="s68">Eventually, they also took our house.</span> <span id="s69">They threw us out of the house and made us --.</span> <span id="s70">So we moved in with an old -- with a widow who had a big house.</span> <span id="s71">We spent, I don’t know how long -- but until the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Do you remember being thrown out of your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s74">Nor do I remember coming back.</span> <span id="s75">I have memories of not having -- we had enough food.</span> <span id="s76">Nobody ever lacked food because we were a village and there were cows, there were chickens, there was everything you’d need for basics.</span> <span id="s77">But we didn’t have wool, we didn’t have shoes and I remember one time an American soldier in a parachute fell down.</span> <span id="s78">He was caught in the trees and he died.</span> <span id="s79">People in the village got the parachute and I think I saw it because I remember blood on the white silk.</span> <span id="s80">My mother gathered the thread and she had someone knit me a sweater and it was horrible.</span> <span id="s81">I hated that sweater with a vengeance.</span> <span id="s82">I remember one day somebody brought us oranges.</span> <span id="s83">I don’t know where they came from.</span> <span id="s84">I had never seen an orange before and sardines.</span> <span id="s85">Also I remember when the Americans came to liberate us, we -- they threw us chewing gum to the kids.</span> <span id="s86">They chewed the same piece, I think, for weeks because it was a novelty.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: All the Germans had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No, the Germans were made prisoners.</span> <span id="s89">They stayed in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: On the spot?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, there were two tanks.</span> <span id="s92">Two tanks and the Germans were in the middle and they threw their arms up in the air and threw their weapons down.</span> <span id="s93">My father picked a great big revolver which he still has from that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Do you know the date that you were liberated by the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I don’t remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: When did you find out that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: That’s a big problem for me.</span> <span id="s98">I do not have very many memories.</span> <span id="s99">I cannot -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s100">The one thing I remember, I assume my parents told me something, what I remember is being after the war we moved to Paris.</span> <span id="s101">I was more than eleven years old.</span> <span id="s102">I remember the synagogue where my parents took me.</span> <span id="s103">My father, especially, had me go.</span> <span id="s104">I had to go, I didn’t have any choice.</span> <span id="s105">I very much hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: You hated it?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: You’re eleven, so that would be about 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: ’48, ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: You said your parents moved to Paris in ’49?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s112">No, I moved in ’47, they followed a year later in ’48.</span> <span id="s113">And then they joined a synagogue and led a more Jewish life.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: You observed Sabbath and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s116">They just went to the shul.</span> <span id="s117">I think for the holidays or something like that.</span> <span id="s118">They were not observant at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: You didn’t go to Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No.</span> <span id="s121">But we observed the holidays and we fasted on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s122">Mostly Yom Kippur, it seems like and the Passover.</span> <span id="s123">Those are the two holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So there was never any sudden revelation to you after the war that you were Jewish ______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: You know something must have happened but I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: You don’t know why they left the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Ostensibly, it was because the village had only one small school where all the children were together from the age of seven to the age of fourteen.</span> <span id="s128">Of course my education in there was not excellent and my mother was worried that I couldn’t stay there if I wanted -- if I was going to college.</span> <span id="s129">But this is not the true reason because I could have gone to ________which was close and spent a week there and come back home for the weekends.</span> <span id="s130">The real reason was that my mother really disliked the village very much.</span> <span id="s131">She felt lost in it.</span> <span id="s132">She came -- she didn’t like the people.</span> <span id="s133">She didn’t like to practice medicine and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Why didn’t she like the people?</span> <span id="s135">Just because their background was so different from her own?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s137">She felt they were peasants and she had nothing in common.</span> <span id="s138">My father, on the other side, very much liked it.</span> <span id="s139">Liked it there, liked to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s140">He was one of these old fashioned doctors who go around.</span> <span id="s141">He went around by bicycle at first, then on a motorcycle, then in a car.</span> <span id="s142">He taught me how to drive the car.</span> <span id="s143">When I was seven years old, he let me use the wheel.</span> <span id="s144">He liked it there but he moved pretty much against his will.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So your father was driving a car during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s147">Yeah, we had a car.</span> <span id="s148">Even in the beginning of the -- there might be a picture of it.</span> <span id="s149">It was a big Maitron.</span> <span id="s150">It was called a great big coach.</span> <span id="s151">I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s152">It was gray and it had the black on the side of it.</span> <span id="s153">It had the black stepping place you know with rubber with lines like that.</span> <span id="s154">It was a great big car.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And he could take that on his rounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s157">My mother took that car when we left, just before the Germans came, I guess.</span> <span id="s158">People were just leaving, running away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s159">So she went down south towards Brittany, towards San _______.</span> <span id="s160">Then there were a lot of bombings apparently.</span> <span id="s161">I don’t recall much about it at all.</span> <span id="s162">But my first memory is being under a table with my grandmother holding on to my sleeve.</span> <span id="s163">I wanted to run out and she was hanging on to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: That was in Brittany?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s166">That was during the evacuation.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Oh, so your village was evacuated when the German army first came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I don’t think the village, I think some people left.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Who could get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And you went with your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: And my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Your grandparents were your mother’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: They joined her from Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes, they came in ’36.</span> <span id="s177">After --they were no longer in Russia.</span> <span id="s178">They left at the Revolution and went to Harbin where there was a large Russian population.</span> <span id="s179">Then my grandmother ---</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Is that in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Harbin?</span> <span id="s182">No, it’s in China.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Habeen?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes, H-a-r-b-i-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Is that near Shanghai?</span> <span id="s186">Because I know a lot of Jews were there (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: A lot of Jews went to Harbin.</span> <span id="s188">It’s somewhere near -- I don’t know exactly where it is.</span> <span id="s189">I saw it on the map, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: But it was a large Russian colony.</span> <span id="s192">Then the -- I think my grandmother opened a restaurant.</span> <span id="s193">They survived as well as they could.</span> <span id="s194">But then, I think, the Japanese, you know there was trouble with the Japanese at that time.</span> <span id="s195">So my mother told them to come to France, asked them to come and they did.</span> <span id="s196">So they arrived just before I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: So your grandparents helped to take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did your mother leave the house for her practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: She was helping _____.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: In the house, yes.</span> <span id="s203">My father was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Do you have any memories of patients coming to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Oh, yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s206">Because the office was in the house.</span> <span id="s207">You know in a small village, everybody knows everybody.</span> <span id="s208">I have memories of going on rounds with my father and being impressed how special he was.</span> <span id="s209">You know people would look forward to him coming and they would always greet him by Monsieur Doctor and offer him coffee and schnapps.</span> <span id="s210">You know coffee and _______.</span> <span id="s211">He joked with them.</span> <span id="s212">He was a very pleasant guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Even in that continued during the war, the relationships?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: This was also the war, yes.</span> <span id="s215">He was not allowed to practice because he was a foreigner.</span> <span id="s216">So he practiced anyway but another doctor signed his papers for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: No one suspected that he, you said he came from Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: And no one suspected that he might be a Romanian Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: And he spoke German.</span> <span id="s221">This was his ---.</span> <span id="s222">Oh, I asked.</span> <span id="s223">I have kept in touch with one family in the village.</span> <span id="s224">The mother Francoise has known me since I was six or so.</span> <span id="s225">I’m very close to her.</span> <span id="s226">She’s sick.</span> <span id="s227">So I asked her husband one time.</span> <span id="s228">You know how -- that it was surprising that nobody knew that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s229">He laughed and he said, what do you mean, nobody knew?</span> <span id="s230">Everybody knew.</span> <span id="s231">So I asked him how come nobody turned us in.</span> <span id="s232">He really struck me when he said, we’re not animals, we don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: So I didn’t realize how very closely knit, --- the photos ---.</span> <span id="s234">Was it because, did your father probably and mother probably had foreign accents?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s236">Everybody had foreign accents.</span> <span id="s237">Even me when I was little because my first language was Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Well, I know that a lot of Jews were hidden by French who knew that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s239">They __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: We didn’t blame him.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: You stood out.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Did you ever get the feeling or did your parents tell you after the war when you had grown up that they lived in fear that they would be discovered?</span> <span id="s244">That the Germans might _____ .</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: My father told a very strange story.</span> <span id="s248">He said that one time, one man came to him and said hey do you remember me?</span> <span id="s249">Apparently this was a man from J______ where my father was born and who knew him.</span> <span id="s250">My father was very frightened because he thought he had turned him in or blackmail or something.</span> <span id="s251">Then a few days later, this man was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: By -- in what circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: By a bomb or ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s255">I mean in a way it was risky to live in an occupied town?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: It was very risky.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: They didn’t have the freedom to go to some other place ______.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: They didn’t -- did you ever know why the decision wasn’t made just to stay further south after they evacuated?</span> <span id="s260">Did _________</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s262">I don’t know why they decided to stick it out.</span> <span id="s263">My parents are very bold in many ways.</span> <span id="s264">I guess they _____.</span> <span id="s265">Even though they must have worried a lot, they still chose to hide in this fashion which was quite risky.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Your mother and your father’s family, did they have siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: My mother had no siblings.</span> <span id="s268">She had cousins but she had no relationships with anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So she didn’t communicate with any of the people that ________?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Right.</span> <span id="s271">My father had --.</span> <span id="s272">He has a brother whom I met once, who lives now in Munich and who was taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s273">His mother came to visit right after I was born and then died of cancer.</span> <span id="s274">He has -- my father, I believe -- has an older sister who is in Israel and an older brother.</span> <span id="s275">But I don’t know anything about them.</span> <span id="s276">He never kept in touch with anybody.</span> <span id="s277">Except his brother Otto who lives in Munich.</span> <span id="s278">When I was 18, he came to visit.</span> <span id="s279">That was the only time I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: But you don’t know where Otto spent the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: He was in a camp, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: ________.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: My grandfather may have been killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s284">He was a merchant in J______ but I know nothing about him.</span> <span id="s285">What kind of things he had or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: So is there anything else you can think of, stories ______?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: I remember there was a --.</span> <span id="s288">Well we were home.</span> <span id="s289">We all had a very bad time before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s290">But that was not because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s291">It was because someone killed a couple of Germans -- soldiers.</span> <span id="s292">We had a little resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s295">And my father was part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Oh, that’s important.</span> <span id="s297">Do you know anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: No.</span> <span id="s299">All I know is that the men had an agreement that they would -- if they were to be captured, they would all run away in the woods and resist.</span> <span id="s300">So I think some of the resistance killed two Germans and there was fighting at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s301">You know, the Germans were defeated then with treaty.</span> <span id="s302">So that one morning, I was woken up by my grandmother who shook me and said quick, quick, we have to run.</span> <span id="s303">She grabbed me by the hand and we went and hid in the outside with the chicken.</span> <span id="s304">The Germans had come.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t know -- I have very few memories of it -- what I felt.</span> <span id="s306">I don’t know if I knew that they had come to everybody or was only my family, thought they had come just for us.</span> <span id="s307">But as we were running, my grandmother and I were hidden but the Germans saw us and they shot towards us but didn’t wound anybody.</span> <span id="s308">My mother stayed in the house with the papers.</span> <span id="s309">I think she was trying to hide papers.</span> <span id="s310">My father and grandfather run away towards the woods to meet the other men.</span> <span id="s311">The Germans shot towards them too but missed.</span> <span id="s312">So that no one run away.</span> <span id="s313">They came back.</span> <span id="s314">The lady who lived in the house just stood there.</span> <span id="s315">I remember she stood there outside and she was screaming.</span> <span id="s316">After that they took us and they put us in front of the Marie and the women were -- they separated men, women and children who were with a teacher.</span> <span id="s317">They were going to take us all to Germany in trucks.</span> <span id="s318">But apparently the priest talked them out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: You don’t know -- that was in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: But it was before the war ended, close to liberation ______?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Would you say, a couple of weeks ______?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I would say maybe less than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And you remember standing in front of the _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: And they had separated you into ___________?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s329">I remember seeing older kids cry so I cried too.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I remember seeing Francoise walking by and she was very pregnant.</span> <span id="s332">That was a frightening time.</span> <span id="s333">But again it was not directly personal.</span> <span id="s334">I have no recollection of anti-Semitism for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: You don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Nothing?</span> <span id="s338">Even any comments, I mean ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Sure there were, there was.</span> <span id="s340">But I think I was too young.</span> <span id="s341">Or either too young or I forgot, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Were people in the village, _______, were they aware of all the horrible things that were happening?</span> <span id="s343">I mean, was there any perception of the roundup of Jews in Paris?</span> <span id="s344">Any deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: I don’t remember anything, myself.</span> <span id="s346">I don’t think I knew anything in particular.</span> <span id="s347">I may have overheard things and then tried to put them together in a child’s way.</span> <span id="s348">But personally I was not aware.</span> <span id="s349">When I grew up I did not want to be.</span> <span id="s350">It took me -- it’s really -- it’s when my daughter was seventeen that she wanted to know about concentration camps, about what happened.</span> <span id="s351">I told her I didn’t know, I didn’t want her to know.</span> <span id="s352">She _______ need to know because she didn’t have to live through it.</span> <span id="s353">You know she was here in America, she was fine.</span> <span id="s354">But she didn’t believe me -- I mean she wanted to know.</span> <span id="s355">So she started reading books.</span> <span id="s356">I started to have nightmares.</span> <span id="s357">Then I felt I didn’t want to leave her alone maybe with all this information.</span> <span id="s358">Or I felt it was cowardly of my part not to learn when she learned and she was quite young.</span> <span id="s359">So then I started very cautiously to inform myself a little more.</span> <span id="s360">By now, now I’ve caught up.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: She’s 24 so ----.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Well, maybe when you talk to your father the next time you’re around him, you could ask him if he has any details ___________?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, it was a very small village.</span> <span id="s365">You know, so I think --.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: But you were never aware of strangers passing through there or anything, that they were helping or -- ________?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: I think the American soldier, you know with the parachute -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s368">I think he died but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s369">I remember there was talk about an American soldier that was helped and hid.</span> <span id="s370">I don’t know if he was that one or another one.</span> <span id="s371">Now who could have passed in my house, people came all the time because patients were there all the time so I would not know who is who.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: How did the -- did the peasants usually pay your father and mother in kind or did they have cash?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, they -----.</span> <span id="s374">Yeah, I think they paid in money, they paid in goods.</span> <span id="s375">Those who couldn’t pay, didn’t pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: But they were able to make a living in this little village or did people come from a larger surrounding area?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: From the larger surroundings.</span> <span id="s378">The village and --.</span> <span id="s379">Because there was one doctor in ______ which was seven kilometers away.</span> <span id="s380">That’s the doctor that signed the papers.</span> <span id="s381">And then -- that’s it.</span> <span id="s382">I think there was just those two for quite a large amount of people.</span> <span id="s383">Of course people didn’t have transportation, you know, in those days.</span> <span id="s384">They had bicycles but cars were very rare.</span> <span id="s385">So my father went on all rounds, he was gone most of the day seeing people.</span> <span id="s386">He also spoke German so he spoke with the Germans.</span> <span id="s387">They also treated Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: How many Germans were actually occupying ______?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: They weren’t near us, of course, because of the house, you know.</span> <span id="s392">Feels like there were – I couldn’t give you a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What did they actually do _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: All this what I’m telling you is the memory of the child and never thought about so what I would say to you, they just sat there and were given things.</span> <span id="s395">They didn’t work.</span> <span id="s396">They didn’t work like the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s397">I think they literally did pretty much just did that.</span> <span id="s398">They were occupying us and I’m sure living off the land.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Do you remember any of them as being mean or kind or ----?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: I remember playing with them, playing with some of them.</span> <span id="s401">I have a feeling that they sort of --were more or less I guess like the rest of us.</span> <span id="s402">We didn’t have SS.</span> <span id="s403">I think we had young men who might have been just as unhappy to be in France as we were unhappy to have them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So you didn’t get the sense that people were particularly bitter about --?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Oh, everybody hated the Boche, you know.</span> <span id="s406">I think compared to the stories I hear of what happened in Paris where literally you saw people shot in the street or treated very inhumanely, I think we hated the Boche because they were there, because they were the enemy.</span> <span id="s407">But I don’t think there were any incidents in our village.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: No one died during the war _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I think, the day they took us, I remember my father was walking around with the Red Cross on his arm.</span> <span id="s410">He took care of somebody who was wounded, I know that.</span> <span id="s411">But I don’t know anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: But you said that you were released pretty quickly all of a sudden ______?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: To me it felt all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s414">I don’t know what people knew.</span> <span id="s415">I remember my parents listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s416">You know, we covered all the windows because there were lots of planes going by.</span> <span id="s417">Now not very far from us, there were blockhouse you know where they were sending V-2’s to England?</span> <span id="s418">So they were trying to bomb those out, the Allies.</span> <span id="s419">But in our village, there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: So you heard planes going over, ___________?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s422">And shooting.</span> <span id="s423">I don’t know exactly where.</span> <span id="s424">Or maybe it was that one incident.</span> <span id="s425">But for a very long time, if I heard gun shot, I would really jump out of my skin but not any more.</span> <span id="s426">Eventually -- or planes in the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Do you remember anything about this ________ priest _?</span> <span id="s428">So he lived in a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah, we had the church.</span> <span id="s430">And he was in the church, for all I know.</span> <span id="s431">I tell you that’s where he lived, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: So you were brought to him to be baptized?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: My parents say no.</span> <span id="s434">That he just gave us some papers.</span> <span id="s435">I’m not sure I would trust that.</span> <span id="s436">I think I may well have been baptized.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Well, you’ve got several coverage protection!</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I’m good either way.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s440">Is there anything else you want to say about __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I am very grateful because since that time I’ve heard so many stories.</span> <span id="s442">What happened to so many people that grew up that way.</span> <span id="s443">That there was more than just the darkness because you have to be living it.</span> <span id="s444">I need to keep a view of the world as not entirely dangerous or evil.</span> <span id="s445">The fact that we were saved, I think, to me makes a big difference.</span> <span id="s446">I’m here.</span> <span id="s447">But also not only because I survived physically but I think because it allowed me to survive psychologically and to want to do the work I do.</span> <span id="s448">I’m ___________, to me, it’s very important to help other people and to help them survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Are you – do you see survivors _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: No, I never have because I see people who have been traumatized but in other ways.</span> <span id="s451">I have tried to distance myself.</span> <span id="s452">For a long time, I didn’t marry a Jew, I never went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s453">I think I tried not to be a Jew because it was so dangerous to me.</span> <span id="s454">Now I joined a group of hidden children and so that has made a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: In Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s457">It’s all over America.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Yes, I have talked to ______.</span> <span id="s459">She was a Catholic nun and she _____.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s461">Once we lived in the suburbs I went to school.</span> <span id="s462">I spent a year in London.</span> <span id="s463">I was going to be an interpreter because I spoke Russian and I spoke some English at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: I forgot to ask you what language you spoke in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I spoke Russian and French, mostly Russian.</span> <span id="s466">French with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s468">That must have distinguished you very much.</span> <span id="s469">Were you perfectly bilingual?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Not in the beginning, afterwards, yes.</span> <span id="s471">The kids used to call me Russian Rabbit which I didn’t like.</span> <span id="s472">Then they would make fun of me saying I was a Russian rabbit.</span> <span id="s473">You know there is a kind of white rabbit with white eyes that’s called a Russian rabbit.</span> <span id="s474">So they would call me that and they would say I have white eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Maybe they thought you were just Russian emigrants?</span> <span id="s476">________?</span> <span id="s477">.</span> <span id="s478">That was probably ___________</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s480">I remember in Paris I joined the -- it wasn’t in Paris, it was the suburbs so it was like a little town, like Bethesda.</span> <span id="s481">I joined the Cub Scout, oop – Girl Scout.</span> <span id="s482">My mother instructed me at this point to tell it was run by a priest, to tell him that I was an Orthodox Russian.</span> <span id="s483">He asked me what do Orthodox Russian do?</span> <span id="s484">I said I don’t know.</span> <span id="s485">I was 12 years old and I went by myself.</span> <span id="s486">I was 13.</span> <span id="s487">So he got very angry at me and told me not to lie.</span> <span id="s488">That it was evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did you have a lot of conflict because you didn’t really have a religious identity or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, very much, very much, yeah.</span> <span id="s491">Because then I ended up in the Girl Scout troop, a Protestant girl.</span> <span id="s492">So I have never been able to identify with a religious group because when I was a child.</span> <span id="s493">--- you know you have a child.</span> <span id="s494">I don’t know whether you are Jewish or –</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Well, I’m – I’m --.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: When I was a child, I liked the church a lot.</span> <span id="s497">Perhaps the priest was good or perhaps the schoolteacher was religious and took us but it always presented me.</span> <span id="s498">I mean my two -- I was growing up with this guy with his big beard of course and sitting on the clouds and ____ was rather stern.</span> <span id="s499">But then there was Jesus who loved little children and took care of all of us.</span> <span id="s500">All we needed to do was to be good.</span> <span id="s501">That was simple enough and Jesus was very forging and understanding.</span> <span id="s502">There was the Virgin Mary and it was a statue and she was so beautiful and she was wearing this blue cape and her hands were around, with such a sweet expression, that I was very attached to that aspect of the church.</span> <span id="s503">I felt safe.</span> <span id="s504">I always felt I would go to Heaven.</span> <span id="s505">I was pretty good little girl.</span> <span id="s506">But one time, I think in front of my mother, I crossed myself, she was furious.</span> <span id="s507">Because, of course, I can’t understand her but it was difficult for me to accept what she stood for because it made no sense to me.</span> <span id="s508">I remember sitting in the synagogue and there was -- we were sitting up on top -- because it was a conservative -- and so I was looking at the head of the men.</span> <span id="s509">I was looking at this rabbi who was short and had a beard and kept moving back and forth and kept talking and talking and talking and talking and ________.</span> <span id="s510">Then the women in my days, were nothing.</span> <span id="s511">The wife of the rabbi was shaved.</span> <span id="s512">She had no hair.</span> <span id="s513">I knew she had no hair but she was wearing a wig.</span> <span id="s514">So I never saw what she looked like without her wig but it felt to me like it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s515">The only other person I ever knew who was shaved, her head was shaved, was the lady across the street who was a spinster.</span> <span id="s516">She met some nice German soldier.</span> <span id="s517">I didn’t know exactly what she did but obviously she had an affair with a German soldier.</span> <span id="s518">After the liberation, they shaved her like a billiard ball.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Did they shave much?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: They shaved her head.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Oh, oh, yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Because she had slept with a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s525">It was a terrible story.</span> <span id="s526">You know everybody was saying _______ was her name, how awful what she did.</span> <span id="s527">I was eight years old so you know, to me it was --.</span> <span id="s528">I just knew it was terrible because people said it was terrible.</span> <span id="s529">She looked terrible with that thin hair.</span> <span id="s530">Then this, wife of the rabbi, also has no hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: So you make this connection?</span> <span id="s532">That’s great.</span> <span id="s533">So you were slightly confused?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s535">Because to me, it really didn’t mean ---.</span> <span id="s536">And then there was Yom Kippur and you had to be afraid because God may or may not grant you another year.</span> <span id="s537">You know, without much understanding of the Jewish religion, you have this 12 year old child, who wasn’t given any explanation very much, coming from a religion that is much warmer and softer; it seemed to me much more tolerant of children.</span> <span id="s538">In this religion, there was just this fierce God who didn’t seem to care, you know, who killed people right and left in the Bible and was looking at me and saying maybe you’ll live another year or not.</span> <span id="s539">I never felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s541">Is there anything else that you want to tell?</span> <span id="s542">You told me about _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I remember the store, Francoise had the store and she was selling everything.</span> <span id="s544">You know, cloths, candy, buttons, margarine, we had no butter, whatever, she sold it in her store.</span> <span id="s545">I remember looking and there was glass in front of ---.</span> <span id="s546">She kept things behind the counter and then there was glass like that.</span> <span id="s547">She had two children too.</span> <span id="s548">I would go to her house every day and I would look at the chocolate behind the glass with such longing.</span> <span id="s549">She said I would like to give you some but I can’t because everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s550">So I was thinking of this chocolate so near and so forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: That would be a ----.</span> <span id="s552">So, in Paris ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: In Paris, so I went to church.</span> <span id="s554">No, I did not go to church.</span> <span id="s555">I wished I would go to church.</span> <span id="s556">I was the only Jew in my class.</span> <span id="s557">All my friends went to church and then they had First Communion.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: What kind of a school did you --?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: B.C. ??</span> <span id="s560">You know it was First Communion or Second Communion and they had those beautiful dresses, all in white with veils.</span> <span id="s561">Oh God.</span> <span id="s562">And I wanted so much to be part of that.</span> <span id="s563">To have a dress like that, to be beautiful but, of course, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s564">I finished school.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Do you remember any anti-Semitism at that time _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: You know, I have a feeling that I wasn’t about to deal with that --- I have no memory.</span> <span id="s567">It seems unreal that I have such a ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Did people know you were Jewish at _________?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s570">Suddenly I didn’t go to church.</span> <span id="s571">Suddenly I couldn’t -- I never wanted to say I was an Orthodox.</span> <span id="s572">I think my mother wanted me to -- maybe I didn’t talk about it but I didn’t have any religion to replace it.</span> <span id="s573">I had no idea what the Orthodox Russian did, I’d never been in on of those churches so it didn’t -- you know I couldn’t carry that.</span> <span id="s574">The girl scouts were Protestant.</span> <span id="s575">I liked that too, it was nice.</span> <span id="s576">I went to church with the Protestants.</span> <span id="s577">If they went, I went.</span> <span id="s578">By that time, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s579">When I finished my baccalaureate, I came to London for a year, came back to France, moved out, lived in Paris till I was 23.</span> <span id="s580">Then I came to America for six weeks vacation.</span> <span id="s581">But I didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s582">I thought I would learn more English because my accent was terrible then.</span> <span id="s583">It’s still sizeable now but then it was remarkable.</span> <span id="s584">No one could understand me pretty much.</span> <span id="s585">So I stayed as an au pair with a family in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s586">Then I went to summer school in Stanford to see the country and study.</span> <span id="s587">Then I decided I was going to be a psychologist because in my free time when I was living in Cambridge, I had the whole day free.</span> <span id="s588">So I marched myself to Harvard and just sat and listened to the courses and found my (End of Side A) I met my husband.</span> <span id="s589">I was about to go back to France and I met him because he was driving back to Boston.</span> <span id="s590">He was going to school and I needed a ride.</span> <span id="s591">So somebody introduced us and we got married.</span> <span id="s592">It was six weeks later, he asked me to marry him and I said yes.</span> <span id="s593">So we got married.</span> <span id="s594">Not really because we had two children.</span> <span id="s595">And we lasted ten years considering we were strangers in many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Well De Long, that’s a French name.</span> <span id="s597">So he was French?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: No, he was American from Iowa.</span> <span id="s599">And his family came -- they were Huguenots that came to Iowa very many years ago.</span> <span id="s600">So he was a little more French than me.</span> <span id="s601">He may have had droplets of French blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: You were both members of persecuted religions?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: The connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: And we had two children whom we did not bring up in a religious way.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: We lived in Cambridge for six years.</span> <span id="s608">My husband was going to Harvard and I went to B.U. and got a degree.</span> <span id="s609">Then we came over here.</span> <span id="s610">We had two small children then.</span> <span id="s611">He came to an age during the Vietnam War so he wouldn’t be drafted.</span> <span id="s612">Then we divorced in ’78.</span> <span id="s613">I stayed for many reasons.</span> <span id="s614">The main reason was not to separate the children from their father and not to break their life completely apart by starting not only with another father.</span> <span id="s615">We stayed close -- we always stayed close.</span> <span id="s616">With another father, a new country and a new language, I thought it’s bad enough for kids.</span> <span id="s617">So we had an agreement who would stay around and we did.</span> <span id="s618">We remained put until last year.</span> <span id="s619">Last year, my ex-husband moved to Atlanta.</span> <span id="s620">I stayed around in Washington.</span> <span id="s621">I started a private practice after I divorced which was not ---.</span> <span id="s622">As I grow older, I feel more and more Jewish.</span> <span id="s623">My daughter considers herself Jewish.</span> <span id="s624">My son, not.</span> <span id="s625">She’s working in Tucson with Russian refugees.</span> <span id="s626">You know, the Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s627">She’s learned to speak Russian on her own.</span> <span id="s628">My son --.</span> <span id="s629">So she does pretty much the work of a social worker or a psychologist, a mother.</span> <span id="s630">My son has studied industrial psychology.</span> <span id="s631">He’s now working with a firm with -- in the area of handicapped but in a -- how big firms deal with handicapped people -- with sexual harassment.</span> <span id="s632">I guess I am still struggling with where I belong but it seems like more and more I feel that I -- I feel a Jewish identity but not religion .</span> <span id="s633">I am less and less a believer.</span> <span id="s634">I don’t think I believe in God any more.</span> <span id="s635">Unfortunately, I can’t believe in Christ any more which makes me sad but he was too much of a childhood.</span> <span id="s636">It’s like a fairy tale now.</span> <span id="s637">It’s a man, not a boy but it’s a fairy tale and one day we have to give him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Well, why -- what do you think _______?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: They were with Jewish.</span> <span id="s640">I always had my Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s641">Good question.</span> <span id="s642">It’s more internal.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Events happen in the Middle East interest you very much, for example?</span> <span id="s644">What happens to the fate of ________?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s646">To me, it feels -- it is heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s647">I have never been to Israel but it’s heartbreaking that they are now killing.</span> <span id="s648">They were sometimes killing children.</span> <span id="s649">There is a good deal of brutality -- that the people in the Middle East were -- lost their land.</span> <span id="s650">Yet, on the other hand, where are the Jews to go?</span> <span id="s651">They need their country.</span> <span id="s652">They need a place.</span> <span id="s653">We need a place in case something happens, we need a home.</span> <span id="s654">So how this is going to end, I don’t know but it’s ---.</span> <span id="s655">I’m afraid it will end very badly for Israel.</span> <span id="s656">I don’t know, to me it feels like it’s something that I cannot avoid.</span> <span id="s657">It’s where I was born, who I am.</span> <span id="s658">Maybe just wisdom that you’re better off just being more what you are rather than fighting it.</span> <span id="s659">As I get older.</span> <span id="s660">It’s not a terrible source of comfort to me unfortunately, but there are no others that I know, that would be any better.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s662">Well, is there anything else?</span></p></body></html>
