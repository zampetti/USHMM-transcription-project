you when you decided to become a nurse, or when did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Probably about 17.</span> <span id="s15">But my family did not want me to become a nurse, so I took a year off before I went into training.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s17">Why do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Well, they didn’t think their daughter should be taking care of sick people and doing all this dirty work.</span> <span id="s19">But I finally convinced them after a year, that’s what I want to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: So you finished high school and took a year off?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Mm-hm, took a year off, took a secretarial course.</span> <span id="s22">And then I went into training the following year.</span></p>

when did you decide you wanted to go into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well, since the war broke out.</span> <span id="s32">I was still in training and I always wanted to go in the service.</span> <span id="s33">I had two brothers that were overseas and I felt as if I wanted to go in to the service and I still had to fight with my parents, they didn’t want me to go in the service now, but I finally convinced them.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Why didn’t they want you to go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: The same reason, safety reasons.</span> <span id="s36">They didn’t want their little daughter, their youngest child overseas and working in the war fields, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you have any idea, really, of what you were -- would be getting into?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes, I had a good idea.</span> <span id="s39">They were begging for nurses at the time and I just -- Uncle Sam needs you, nurses posters all over the place, so soon as I took my state boards, I a-applied to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Uh-huh and then -- and when did you go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: August of ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s43">So there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Maybe it was August of ‘43.</span> <span id="s45">No, ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: There was fighting going on [indecipherable] the invasion had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s48">Yeah, on our way -- on our way over, the Battle of the Bulge was going on.</span> <span id="s49">Oh yes, they s -- were fighting for a long time before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s51">So you went across in December?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yeah, December of ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Mm-hm, and can you tell me the full name of your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: The 131st evacuation hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s56">And you were attached to what army?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well, we were with the ei-eight army for awhile.</span> <span id="s58">I think we were with the 15th army for awhile and I think we were with the third army for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s60">So it was a unit of how many doctors and nurses?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well, there were 40 nurses, about 40 doctors and quite a few enlisted men.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Uh-huh and as -- at -- what was the responsibility of the enlisted men with the hospital unit?</span> <span id="s63">What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, they were corpsmen.</span> <span id="s65">They were corpsmen and they -- maintenance, setting up tents and taking care of odds and ends [inaudible] and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So they didn’t fight, they just stayed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No, they didn’t fight, no, was not a fighting unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: It was like a MASH unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s71">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s72">And where was -- you were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: We landed in England just before Christmas.</span> <span id="s74">We stayed in England, in fact, they didn’t send our unit over to France until, oh, two or three months later.</span> <span id="s75">But in the meantime they assigned us in certain groups to go work in some of the general hospitals in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Mm-hm, caring for US servicemen?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Our -- our men, yes.</span> <span id="s78">Our men that came back through that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s80">So these were men who had been fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Who had been fighting and they were on their way home, probably and they were -- we took care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s83">What was -- what was your response to that, the first time caring for soldiers, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Was the same as taking care of any patient.</span> <span id="s85">I trained in the city hospital, New York City, so -- we did a lot of work like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you talk with them very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s88">Oh, very, very friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: They gave me little souvenirs.</span> <span id="s91">One man gave me a -- colored man, I’ll never forget him, he gave me little dime and he put a hole in it, to put in my dogtags.</span> <span id="s92">And they gave me a party with -- this one hospital there, when I -- they knew we were moving out with our own unit and it was -- it was heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s93">They were singing, “She’s a Jolly Good Fellow,” and we had a regular party.</span> <span id="s94">It was nice.</span> <span id="s95">They appreciate anything you did for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Course they had been through hell, over on the continent.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s99">Did they tell you about what -- what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: They told us stories, but they weren’t that talkative about it.</span> <span id="s101">I mean, everybody had a general idea of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And when did you go across then -- across the channel and --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: It must have been the early part of ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s105">And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Across the [indecipherable] channel.</span> <span id="s107">A small ship we crossed with.</span> <span id="s108">They’d drop in depth charges, scared the living daylights out of us.</span> <span id="s109">Nobody told us they were depth charges, we thought we were being torpedoed.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: All night long, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yeah, quite a bit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s113">And then you went -- where did you get sent to?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: We were -- we stayed as a unit and we traveled in trucks, back of trucks.</span> <span id="s115">We spent more time in the back of trucks than I care to remember.</span> <span id="s116">And we set up our hospital in three or four places on the way up and we were in Germany on VE Day, in tents, loads of mud.</span> <span id="s117">And we stayed there until our unit got orders to go up to Camp Gusen -- Mauthausen -- at that time.</span> <span id="s118">But they wouldn’t let the nurses go up at the time The colonel said that we had to stay behind because it was so gruesome.</span> <span id="s119">But they would send for us.</span> <span id="s120">So, they did send for us about a week later and then they told us if we didn’t want to go in -- the nurses, we didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s121">But we all went.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Do you remember what you were -- can you tell me about VE Day, how you heard the news that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I don’t know, somebody came through the camp, probably enlisted men or somebody saying VE Day was over -- was there, and -- oh, there was a lot of celebration, everybody was very happy, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Do you remember what you all did?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I think we had a party somewhere.</span> <span id="s126">And the usual -- everybody was real happy this was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s128">And shortly thereafter then, you moved in early May to Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: To Austria, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: And tell me what you did there.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: We worked in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s132">We put on our fatigues, we put on masks, we put on something what cover our hair.</span> <span id="s133">And we went in and most of the bodies had been buried and the ones that were there were so sick and they were dying on us all over the place.</span> <span id="s134">And we couldn’t do too much for them.</span> <span id="s135">Our -- most -- our corpsmen did a lot.</span> <span id="s136">And we’d go down and give them pills.</span> <span id="s137">I forgot what the German word was for diarrhea and all that business and we’d pass them out and they’d kind of hoard them under their -- their mattresses, they didn’t take them right away.</span> <span id="s138">And they -- we fed them and we had plasma, we had IVs and as soon as they sent them back to their own countries, as soon as they were able to, they burned down the she -- the barracks that they were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you have any sense of -- when you -- you first arrived and you were at Gusen, right?</span> <span id="s140">Which is --</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah, that’s just the name of the camp, yeah, it was part of Mauthausen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s143">A subcamp of Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I think so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s146">And who were the people who were there?</span> <span id="s147">Mostly men or women or -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I worked mostly with the men, but there were women there, they tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: And -- and did you have direct contact with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: -- did you talk to them, did you -- or were they able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, none of them were Americans, very few of them spoke English, so we didn’t have that much contact with them.</span> <span id="s153">We just looked at them and saw what we could do to help them and what the officers told us to do and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s155">And you would -- they would be cared for in a ward?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: They were in their own barracks, yeah, they were three t-tiers high and they were just -- they were skin and bones, I mean, they really didn’t even seem like patients, I mean they just -- people -- they were -- it was pathetic, really.</span> <span id="s157">It was a sight you didn’t want to know -- in fact I tore up the pictures the chaplain gave us a few years later.</span> <span id="s158">I just didn’t want to look at it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What were those pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: They’re the ones that you see on TV etcetera, with a -- just the skeletons being buried, etcetera.</span> <span id="s161">And I -- that one you -- on -- just got from Discovery Channel brought back a lot of memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: The film of the men --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: The films, yeah -- the men that were raiding Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Brought back a lot of memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s167">Wh-What was your response at the time, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, you were young at the time.</span> <span id="s169">You were a nurse and you knew that they needed help, you were in the army to help and you did what they told you to do.</span> <span id="s170">It was gruesome, that -- that time, it bothered you, but I think it would bother me a lot more if I saw that today.</span> <span id="s171">But that time, I mean, you were young, you -- this was part of your job.</span> <span id="s172">This wa -- was what you were in the army for.</span> <span id="s173">We didn’t expect it to be taking care of these -- this type of patients.</span> <span id="s174">But they needed help and we were willing to give it.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s176">And how long did you do that for?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I think we were in Gusen for four or five weeks, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s178">You know, things are blank, it’s 50 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: About four or five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And a typical routine would be what for you?</span> <span id="s182">What would your typical day be like?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s184">I know you got up and had breakfast and then they put us on the trucks.</span> <span id="s185">As I said, we wore fatigues and masks and covered our hair because of the lice.</span> <span id="s186">And we’d go in the camp and we’d help, whatever we could do.</span> <span id="s187">They didn’t want us to have too much contact with the patients directly because of the diseases</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Physical contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Physical contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So they asked you --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: And there wasn’t much to do, I mean, otherwise, pass out pills and things like -- we didn’t bathe them or do anything like that because they were so emaciated, you couldn’t do anything for them, particularly.</span> <span id="s192">And as soon as they were able, they shipped them back to their own countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s194">Did -- di -- were there people from the l -- city, the local community coming in to help any?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: They brought -- well, the soldiers made them come in and help.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: In fact, I remember distinctly they brought Nazi soldiers in, but boy it must have been the bottom of the heap because they looked -- looked more like kids, 13 - 14 - 15 years old, a Nazi soldier and they made them help clean up and take care of the bodies and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s198">And some of the local people came in, yeah.</span> <span id="s199">In fact, they said that they used to go into the town and drag everybody in off the street that was able-bodied and bring them in and make them help clean up this camp.</span> <span id="s200">They did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Do you remember seeing those people come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yes, I saw some of them come in, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Be surprised.</span> <span id="s205">Well dressed and they were helping.</span> <span id="s206">They made them help.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s208">D-Do you know if they -- those people were expressing anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No.</span> <span id="s210">They were just kind of blank.</span> <span id="s211">They’d give them something to do and they would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: After you would give these people pills and what kind of food were you able to give them?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: The corpsmen handed out as much food as they could wrangle together, but these people couldn’t eat too much.</span> <span id="s214">You have to remember, they were starved for years, you know.</span> <span id="s215">You give them too much to eat and that would be the end of them.</span> <span id="s216">They would upchuck and stuff.</span> <span id="s217">You can’t give a starving patient food, but what -- what we had and what we -- they were sending up to us, they got.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Which would be what, for example, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I don’t remember too much about it.</span> <span id="s220">I -- I think there was soup and I think there was bread and things like that.</span> <span id="s221">But some of them couldn’t tolerate even that.</span> <span id="s222">This goes back a long time, you know, there was these little things you don’t remember too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s224">Do -- what did you do after your assignment at Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: They told us that we were a new unit and they were sending us back to the United States for a short leave and then we were going to go over to Japan.</span> <span id="s226">So we traveled down from Gusen on trains and we were in France for awhile and then we were on the General Bliss, we came back to the United States.</span> <span id="s227">And I happened to be home in Kingston on VJ Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: I was in Kingston, VJ Day.</span> <span id="s230">And then we had to go back to our unit, then we were reassigned down to -- I was reassigned to Texas.</span> <span id="s231">And they wanted some of us to stay in, but I was anxious to get home.</span> <span id="s232">I wasn’t in that long.</span> <span id="s233">I was only in about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s234">But they gave us a -- a double time for being overseas.</span> <span id="s235">And my brothers were both home and they were doctors and I was a nurse and I knew they were going to start an office shortly and I was supposed to be their nurse.</span> <span id="s236">And I did that, but when I did get home, they encouraged me to go back to college on the GI bill, and I got my BS with my RN in education.</span> <span id="s237">So I worked with them for awhile and unfortunately the one doctor, the one that bought this place here, he died.</span> <span id="s238">Had a coronary down -- big lake down there, the age of 43 and that kind of took the starch out of us.</span> <span id="s239">And my other brother got out of practice a few years later to do research for Squibb’s drug company, radioactive isotopes.</span> <span id="s240">And then I had to find, they gave up the office and I had to find a job, so I decided to use my degree.</span> <span id="s241">So I started teaching practical nursing.</span> <span id="s242">And I did that up until 1979, when I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: You mentioned that you had some photographs that were taken by your -- was it the chaplain of your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yes, I tore those [indecipherable] up.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And that you tore them up?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I tore them -- I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s247">It was only a couple of years ago, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You saved them all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: And I -- I -- I had them in a box here, with all the rest of my things and I -- I just looked at those things and they were so gruesome, I decided I just didn’t want to look at them any more.</span> <span id="s250">I mean, there are so many of those around.</span> <span id="s251">I don’t know, I was just in that kind of a mood that night and I started tearing up things and I tore those up.</span> <span id="s252">The girls will have them, they all -- a lot of them saved -- most of them saved them, but I just didn’t want to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: It was hard [indecipherable] to see them -- see these people, human beings, what they did to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s256">How do you think having that experience had an impact on you as a young person at that time, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: It wasn’t nice, but it didn’t hurt us too much.</span> <span id="s258">I mean, we could see what was going on.</span> <span id="s259">You have to remember, I was in the -- didn’t get in the army til the end and we had heard all these stories, seen all these stories on TV about the Nazis and all this and you’d see people -- them lining people up and shooting them and things like that and that bothered you, but -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s260">It didn’t have that much permanent effect on me.</span> <span id="s261">At the time, felt sick when we saw some of this.</span> <span id="s262">But I don’t think it had a permanent effect on us, except for the fact that I hope it never happens again.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Before you arrived at Gusen, did you have any idea, what -- what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Well, the -- the colonel on our unit told us it was horrible, they were burying bodies as fast as they could get them.</span> <span id="s265">They didn’t think it was a very good sight for the nurses to go up and see it -- I don’t know how many other nurse units went in there.</span> <span id="s266">I don’t know of any at the time.</span> <span id="s267">And they said that it was gruesome, they were burying the bodies and they were being helped by some of the other outfits.</span> <span id="s268">And as soon as they thought it wasn’t as bad, they would send for us, which they did about a week later.</span> <span id="s269">And I’ll never forget the colonel getting up and telling us that he would not hold it against any nurse if she did not want to go up there.</span> <span id="s270">He said, but they could use the help and if we wanted to go up, if not, we could stay right where we were, until they all came back down.</span> <span id="s271">But every one of us, 40 of us went right up there.</span> <span id="s272">Nobody even thought twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Do you have any idea of how many people you cared for or how many --</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Up there?</span> <span id="s275">You didn’t really care for people like that, you just went down and helped those that looked the sickest.</span> <span id="s276">I mean you didn’t get an assignment, this patient’s yours and that patient’s yours and that.</span> <span id="s277">You walked into this building, you see all these bodies up in the bunks, just about skin and bones, I wouldn’t even call them bodies, skin and bones, you know.</span> <span id="s278">You just went around with that and if somebody told you to do something for them, you did them, but I mean, it was no actual nursing care like you would see in a hospital, washing them and doing things like that.</span> <span id="s279">They couldn’t, there wasn’t anything left of the poor souls.</span> <span id="s280">There were the -- few that left -- I don’t know how many of them lived after they got back to their own country.</span> <span id="s281">I don’t know how they could have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Were there hundreds of them, or thousands of them?</span> <span id="s283">Do you have any sense of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I have no idea and I can’t remember, but I’m sure there were quite a few barracks with quite a few people in them.</span> <span id="s285">I am not su -- I’m sure there weren’t thousands, cause the -- they didn’t [indecipherable], but I remember distinctly going over and seeing the gas chambers and seeing this wall that they walked them up and the crematoriums, you know, and that -- that kind of turns your stomach.</span> <span id="s286">And then the story came out that they had captured the commandant on the camp.</span> <span id="s287">I think -- I thought it was the inmates that were able to, that were still there, that -- that had captured him, but it -- it might have been some of the soldiers, too, but I think it was the inmates.</span> <span id="s288">And they brought him down, I guess and then they hung him.</span> <span id="s289">I s -- you saw the picture of him hanging there.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I didn’t feel sorry for him at all, because the stories that we did get, through interpreters, that some of them, I -- one had a son or something si-sit on the wall of the concentration camp and just kept shooting things.</span> <span id="s292">And somebody told us about wives of the soldiers or the commandant making lampshades out of the skin of these people.</span> <span id="s293">Somebody said something about making soap out of the fat, whatever fat there was left.</span> <span id="s294">No, it -- it was -- pull your [indecipherable] memories back that I forgot about.</span> <span id="s295">But I remember all those things and I remember living in a -- houses that used to house the SS troop or officers.</span> <span id="s296">The nurses lived in those.</span> <span id="s297">I can’t remember where the men lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Were they nouse -- nice houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No, they were just like barracks, except low rooms with two beds in them, that was it.</span> <span id="s300">But they were clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: And overlooked the Danube.</span> <span id="s303">I always dreamt of seeing the Danube and here I was looking at the Danube.</span> <span id="s304">It wasn’t blue, believe me.</span> <span id="s305">And I enjoyed Austria.</span> <span id="s306">I went down to a church one night in Linz.</span> <span id="s307">And I’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s308">I’m Catholic and we went to the church and they were having benediction and all these priests, this choir was singing.</span> <span id="s309">It was the most beautiful thing I ever heard in my life.</span> <span id="s310">I wish I’d had a tape recorder to tape it.</span> <span id="s311">It was a beautiful church.</span> <span id="s312">I nev -- I forgot what the name of it is, some of the girls probably know.</span> <span id="s313">It was fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: I understand that at Gusen there was a quarry where the people were forced to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I heard the story, but I don’t remember too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did you see the -- there was a -- supposedly a big stairway where --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yeah, I’ve got a picture of that.</span> <span id="s318">I just showed you the picture, yeah.</span> <span id="s319">We saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Can you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: It’s just a big stairway that went up, I think.</span> <span id="s322">I heard since it’s 180-some steps or something like that, but -- it’s gruesome what one human being could do to another human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: And not think anything of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s326">Anything you want to say or talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No.</span> <span id="s328">I think you racked my memory pretty well.</span> <span id="s329">I guess I tried to block a lot of this out, but this is [indecipherable] stand out in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Do people ask you or do you ever tell people about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I’ve told people about it, but I mean, I don’t go overboard.</span> <span id="s332">I haven’t made any speeches.</span> <span id="s333">I haven’t broadcast the fact too much that I was -- they knew I was an army nurse in my hometown here.</span> <span id="s334">And -- but I never went into anything, like I didn’t join the reserve or I didn’t do -- I went on with my life after it was over with.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Have you ever thought about maybe talking with schoolchildren or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No.</span> <span id="s337">I’m not a great public speaker anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: You’re shy, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: No, I’m not shy.</span> <span id="s340">I taught nursing to -- to high school students for years.</span> <span id="s341">No, I’m not that shy.</span> <span id="s342">But that was -- it’s one of those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Okay, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Did you get enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Yup.</span> <span id="s346">Hang on a second.</span> <span id="s347">This is the end of the interview with Dorothy Maroon.</span> <span id="s348">Tape side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Good, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: I’m back with Dorothy Maroon.</span> <span id="s351">Tell me, you -- your yee -- your unit -- members of your unit have been in touch with each other for 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: The nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: The nurses, right</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Nurses basic -- basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Why and how do you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: We were very close, we really were, the closest group of girls I’ve ever been with.</span> <span id="s359">And I mean -- we went through a war together, we never fought.</span> <span id="s360">We did everything for each other we could and we came home and we had a few reunions.</span> <span id="s361">I think we had one here in West Park.</span> <span id="s362">At the time -- this was years ago.</span> <span id="s363">I think we had one at Ruth Eberly’s house.</span> <span id="s364">Then we had one in Brooklyn and just about -- say about eight, nine years ago, most of the girls who had married, their children are grown up and we always kept in touch with Christmas cards, if nothing else and we decided to start having the reunions.</span> <span id="s365">And I was lucky enough to have a big enough place that they could come and it was central and we started having it, mostly up here.</span> <span id="s366">In the wintertime, occasionally we have one at Ellen Bo -- Ellen Marchese’s place in Florida.</span> <span id="s367">Just a lunch.</span> <span id="s368">And then last year we had one up at Louise Birch’s place in New Hampshire.</span> <span id="s369">And I must have had about five or six here.</span> <span id="s370">But we always had a good time and -- and it’s good to see them all, really good.</span> <span id="s371">Love seeing them, hope we can keep it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: That’s a remarkable record.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah, we’ll there are only -- there were 40 nurses originally, we can only account for about 17 still living.</span> <span id="s374">And we got nine here today, which is pretty good.</span> <span id="s375">One that’s not here is in Texas, one is in California.</span> <span id="s376">You can’t expect them to come all that way.</span> <span id="s377">Since we’ve been having the reunions the last three or four years, we’ve lost about three or four more.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s379">50th is --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: It’s a long time.</span> <span id="s381">But we like each other very much.</span> <span id="s382">We get along very well together and if we have a reunion, everybody chips in and helps and it’s not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Yeah, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">End of Tape One, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
