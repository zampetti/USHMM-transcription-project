id="s11">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">We're starting now.</span> <span id="s13">Can you talk about how things changed with the coming of the Nazis, and talk about the suddenness and the gradualness sort of mixed together, and how people were, didn't realize what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">We immediately at the end of the hostilities, uh, there was a return to relatively normal life in the little town of Meyerhof, where I lived in, in Poland, but then, gradually there was a, an increase in the persecution by, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s15">First the military left and the SS came and then with the SS came the uh the Ukrainians and the Lithuanians, who really were rather cruel towards the Jews.</span> <span id="s16">So there was an ever-increasing intensity of persecution.</span> <span id="s17">Then, establishment of the ghetto, uh, and ultimately the uh deportations or whatever are the term one wants to use.</span> <span id="s18">I think the term deportation is a bit misleading.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Let's cut because is that the answer you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Wait till he gets slated.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">At the end of the hostilities, that is when Poland was defeated, life came to relatively uh normal type of situation in the little town of Veerhoff where I lived.</span> <span id="s24">Uh, but then there was a ever-increasing intensity of persecution.</span> <span id="s25">First of all, the, the military left.</span> <span id="s26">The Wehrmacht, the, who were relatively uh non- uh punitive towards Jews or for that matter anyone.</span> <span id="s27">Uh, then comes the civil administration, the German administration, the SS, and with them come the uh, they hire the guns so to say the, uh, the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians, who were really very vicious and cruel towards the Jews particularly.</span> <span id="s28">Uh, then ghetto is formed, and once and first the ghetto, there are very inhuman conditions uh through enough, but one can still go back and forth.</span> <span id="s29">But, the main point is that there is a slow increase in the, uh, in the nature of persecution, that there is a kind of a, uh, things are not all that bad.</span> <span id="s30">It's quite possible to survive.</span> <span id="s31">Uh, and after all, all along, we hope that those big powers, France, England, United States, any moment, they're going to come uh, into real war, and quickly defeat Germany.</span> <span id="s32">So, all along, there is the notion, we can somehow make it, and when the uh, you know, when the deportations, or as we called them, Ausedlung, or Actions, Action in German, uh come, uh then generally it is really too late to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Were people, once those things started, tell me what those things were, and once things started, did people know what was going on in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">No, we uh, my, was a shock to me that when I looked into it, once I was in United States, that a reader of the New York Times knew a great deal more, and I have copies of those, uhhhh, newspapers, than we did, who were there!</span> <span id="s35">Because we had no way of communicating with each other.</span> <span id="s36">Uh, in fact, in our little town, the community hired a Pole to follow the trains, so that we know where the trains are going, because we didn't.</span> <span id="s37">And he lost track.</span> <span id="s38">You know, he couldn't follow it, and we didn't know.</span> <span id="s39">That's a absolute fact that we did not know what was going on uh, until it, until after the war really.</span> <span id="s40">Now, somebody got the, you know, there are some people I have uh examined a lot of uh survivors who didn't know when they arrived in Auschwitz what was going on.</span> <span id="s41">So, there was a general lack of knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Can you talk about different conditions in Eastern and Western Europe, and also how readily recognizable Jews were.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">For a Jew in Poland to hide was generally, virtually impossible, to hide by I mean, I mean, to adopt a non-Jewish identity, I don't mean hiding in some closet.</span> <span id="s44">Uh, to be on false papers, because Jews talked differently, they had clear cut accent, Jewish accent, they looked differently, Poland is a homogeneous society uh where uh there are no outsiders.</span> <span id="s45">Americans uh are used to Italians and Spaniards and uh Norwegians.</span> <span id="s46">You don't have that in Poland.</span> <span id="s47">It's a homogeneous society.</span> <span id="s48">Uh, Jews were the only, generally, the only outsiders.</span> <span id="s49">They spoke differently, they behaved differently, and they looked differently.</span> <span id="s50">And last not least, if they were males, they were circumcised.</span> <span id="s51">The only men who were circumcised were Jews.</span> <span id="s52">So, if you had any doubts about a male's identity, all you had to do is drop his pants and you knew he was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">And how was that different from other parts of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">In other parts of Europe, the Jews were different because the Jews were assimilated.</span> <span id="s55">In Poland, they assimilated group of Jews with uh a min--tiny minority.</span> <span id="s56">Uh, in Germany, majority of Jews were indistinguishable from the Germans.</span> <span id="s57">It took all kind of research to determine that somebody was a Jew.</span> <span id="s58">There were lots of uh German Jews who just found out thanks to Hitler that they were Jews.</span> <span id="s59">You didn't have that kind of quote unquote "problem" in Poland.</span> <span id="s60">You knew you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s61">Poles around you made it clear to you that you were a Jew, so there was no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s62">So Jews were assimilated in, in other parts of, of Europe.</span> <span id="s63">The other, the level of antisemitism was entirely different.</span> <span id="s64">Even in Germany.</span> <span id="s65">The Germans who, after all are responsible for the genocide of the Jews, were certainly not as antisemitic as Poles.</span> <span id="s66">I don't think anyone would argue that.</span> <span id="s67">So, that's another factor.</span> <span id="s68">But the Germans behaved differently.</span> <span id="s69">I challenge anyone to say that the Germans were the same in Poland as they were in France.</span> <span id="s70">The same troops, I don't mean that they were physically different.</span> <span id="s71">You take a SS unit, and you station the SS unit in Krakow, and you transfer it them to Par-to Paris or Amsterdam, and they are different, because they are among humans.</span> <span id="s72">In Poland, they were not among humans, but a-among barbarians.</span> <span id="s73">Their contempt for Poles was just a little bit less than for Jews.</span> <span id="s74">I mean, Jews were non-human, poles were sub-human.</span> <span id="s75">And, so they could behave without any kind of restraint, towards the Jews and towards the Poles.</span> <span id="s76">In Denmark, a Danish citizen, annoyed with how the Germans behave, spit into the face of an SS man, and got a 30 day suspended sentence.</span> <span id="s77">In Poland you get a bullet between your eyes on the spot.</span> <span id="s78">It was a different world.</span> <span id="s79">The Germans behaved differently in Poland than in Western Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">What were deportations, and what did people think they were.</span> <span id="s81">It was announced from time to time that there would be a deportation, that people would go to work in the east.</span> <span id="s82">Now remember, the east was someplace out in Russia, uh, it was as far removed as if somebody told you that you're going to travel to outer space.</span> <span id="s83">Well, you'd probably know more about outer space now than we did know what's out there in, in Russia.</span> <span id="s84">And, the assumption, at least they said, you go there to work.</span> <span id="s85">And they directed to bring certain implements with you, and food and whatever.</span> <span id="s86">It would vary from locality to locality.</span> <span id="s87">So, there was a kind of a feeling of anxiety and they unknown, there's something terrible happening, but it was not clear, there was no clear cut knowledge as to what was the purpose of it, and after all, as all human beings, uh, the Jews of Poland did engage in some denial.</span> <span id="s88">I mean, one wanted to be hopeful, and again, it's very difficult to conceptualize, to think of something that is unthinkable.</span> <span id="s89">How do you imagine the unthinkable.</span> <span id="s90">Now we know, but then we didn't.</span> <span id="s91">It was just inconceivable to us, that something that terrible could be happening.</span> <span id="s92">It was true in my family.</span> <span id="s93">My father who was educated in Vienna, and who spoke fluently German um was much more reluctant to...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">We have to stop, we just ran out.</span> <span id="s95">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Okay, you were talking about how difficult it was to realize what was going on, and you had just started about your father, so why don't you pick it up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">My father was educated, at least in part, in Vienna, spoke fluently German, and was really sort of familiar with the German culture, and that in a way, was his downfall because he just could not believe uh that Germans would engage in something so barbaric, whereas my mother was responding more to uh to sort of clues that came from the environment, became very anxious, bordering on sort of almost irrational in her anxiety.</span> <span id="s99">She was just roaming around asking uh, uh even strangers could they somehow help, you know in terms of doing something for uh, like for me, and my mother was indeed the one who was responsible for securing for me the place in the monastery through a woman that she barely knew, uh was a woman who was selling sweets uh in our town and my mother spoke to her and somehow through that uh established on a very short notice uh my ability to, to leave and go to the monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Okay, I want to back up and ask you to define for me again as though I don't, I don't know what a ghetto is.</span> <span id="s101">I don't know about the formation of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Well, one day, there came an announcement that there would be a Jewish quarters, which has come to be known as the ghetto, but they, the Germans call it the Jewish quarters essentially in in German, and uh it gave you a perimeters where Jews could live, which was a tiny portion of the town, and I'm speaking of the town where I lived, but it was similarly true in other towns, and uh, the Poles who lived in that area had to evacuate, but that wasn't a problem because there was the area that the Jews left was a much wider one so who, whatever a Pole was displaced from the Jewish designated area for Jews, they got much better quarters anyway, but not the other way around, uh, in terms of the, the Jews moved in few families into one room, two families.</span> <span id="s103">Maybe one family in one room in the beginning, because the ghetto, they have the Jewish area, the Jewish part of town, would become smaller and smaller and smaller, but at first it was open, so you could get in and out in certain hours.</span> <span id="s104">For example, there were uh a Jew could not be in the street after 7 o’clock.</span> <span id="s105">But at other times, you could get out and mingle, be outside.</span> <span id="s106">One day there was an announcement, the ghetto is closed, and there were gates, there were walls -------------- and you couldn't get out, so you see there was this ever-increasing uh level of persecution.</span> <span id="s107">I think that is the critical issue both in terms of ghetto, in terms of what, what happens in the ghetto, even when they closed the ghetto there was still enough food somehow brought in, but then suddenly there is less food.</span> <span id="s108">Suddenly the ghetto is being made smaller instead of there being forced blocks.</span> <span id="s109">Now there are only 2 blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">You talked about what things were punishable by death in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s111">What kinds of things were--what were the punishments?</span> <span id="s112">What was against the law?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Virtually everything that was contrary to the, uh, not the law, because there was no law, but contrary to a kind of an order given by the local German uh administration, was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s114">So, for example, uh, going after the time that was forbidden for Jews, let's say after 8 o clock, or after 7 o clock at one point, was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s115">Not wearing your armband was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s116">Getting outside of ghetto was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s117">Having white bread, I mean that is a fact, where that I know of someone who got shot on the spot, and I hope I can tell it without reacting as I often do, uh, that that person got shot.</span> <span id="s118">(Crying, long pause).</span> <span id="s119">That always gives me trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Tell me what it was like to live on areas -----------------, and tell me why you were able to do that.</span> <span id="s121">What special things made it so you were able to?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">(Long pause) Well, my parents, unlike virtually um all of the Jews in our, in our town, that varied from town to town were assimilated, that is they spoke very well polish, and were generally indistinguishable from the rest of the population, and certainly that applied to me as a, as a youngster, so I could pretend that I was not a Jew, uh with some difficulty.</span> <span id="s123">Obviously at first when I came to the monastery, my familiarity with prayers, my familiarity with uh catholic uh liturgy, and so was limited but I had some so I could, I could uh, uh pretend.</span> <span id="s124">Most Jews, or most boys my age would not be able to do that uh, in Poland that is.</span> <span id="s125">So, that accounts for my uh ability to live on false papers, but that was the only, that was the beginning.</span> <span id="s126">Uh, I would, one also had to have great deal, I can say it now in retrospect without having to be falsely modest, it required resourcefulness, courage, and an ability to sort of adapt to circumstances and perceive, you know, you looked at another person, and you knew that that person had a look in his or her eyes, is he a Jew?</span> <span id="s127">And then you had to take some action.</span> <span id="s128">Say something.</span> <span id="s129">I would, for example, if I was on a street car, and, and, and a person had a look like, ah, that kid might be a Jew, I would go to that person, and ask something, or maybe make some kind of a comment, and a fairly aggressive comment, and maybe, like you know in a train I would say, "Would you move your suitcase," or something like that, and that would right away dispel that person's suspicion, because first of all my language would be clear, so that most likely he's not a Jew, and my behavior would be then different, so you see it wasn't only the language, the appearance, but also the behavior.</span> <span id="s130">There was in Poland a kind of a expression that they could recognize a Jew by sadness in his or her eyes or false papers.</span> <span id="s131">Now remember that there was generally fear of having a Jew live somewhere nearby because you could get punished for it, and great many people also were antisemitic, and approved of the persecution of Jews.</span> <span id="s132">That is quite inconceivable to many Poles nowadays, the new Polish uh generation, young people find this offensive when one mentions that it was perfectly acceptable in Poland during World War Two to see Jews tormented because it is not acceptable now.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">I only have a little bit left, I'm trying to think of something short.</span> <span id="s134">Tell me what were liquidations in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Liquidation was a term that we used, meaning that the ghetto would be closed, that there would be not, see one never knew, is this the final type of uh deportation or would they permit or some people remain.</span> <span id="s136">See as, as a ghetto was being, as the deportation would start, people would have certain papers that allowed them to stay, there were certain, there was a hierarchy, okay?</span> <span id="s137">You worked in this place, you worked in that place, those papers were good, these ones were not, and one never knew for sure, well, is this the final liquidation of that particular ghetto in this locality or not?</span> <span id="s138">So, you could only for sure tell in retrospect.</span> <span id="s139">There were small, see they, the procedure that they followed that we didn't know about, they always concentrated, they closed the smaller ghettos.</span> <span id="s140">Then they made the bigger ghettos.</span> <span id="s141">Ultimately there was, for example in the, in the county where I lived, there were number of Jewish communities...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">We just ran out.</span> <span id="s143">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Well, just do whatever--</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Sometime in 1942, probably early in summer of 42 it became pretty apparent that there would be a final liquidation of the ghetto, and my mother became very anxious and just talked to anyone she could to create some type of a setting where she and my sister, and I, I was 14 years old at the time, not quite 14, uh, and my mother did, through an acquaintance, arrange for a man named Godumsky, to come, she lived in Chanstohova??</span> <span id="s147">to come to Mierhow, and take me to the monastery of Mogilla.</span> <span id="s148">Now you have to keep in mind that there was no way of communicating, and one couldn't trust, there were some phones, but one couldn't really communicate.</span> <span id="s149">This, this lady contacted Mr. Godumsky, who didn't quite know what she wanted from him, so he came, and because we anticipated that the ghetto would be liquidated the next day, my mother left me with this lady, and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s150">The many came and he did agree to take me to the monastery, but obviously he didn't know if the monastery would accept me.</span> <span id="s151">And it so happened that that very day indeed, as he and I were going to the train station, there was the final liquidation of the ghetto, and as I walked with him, Jews were being driven in the streets to the trains, and I bought a ticket, uh, I had uh a false document, but he didn't, I didn’t have to show it, and he and I didn't go together.</span> <span id="s152">Mr. Godumsky and I didn't go together, because if they caught me, he would be also uh punished.</span> <span id="s153">So, we got on a train, and we took the train to Krakow, which was what uh, maybe just 40 miles I think it's 60 - 70 kilometers from Mierhoff and then from the train station, we had to walk to the monastery, which was quite a distance at the time, and while I waited outside, he went and talked to the prior, whom he told a lie, mainly that I was a converted Jew, that my family was not really Jews, but converted Jews, and the prior agreed to accept me into the seminary, into the novitiate, and I at that point became a student so to say, for priesthood, and I uh lived there, again, I can't be certain for how long, uh because when I start add up all various experiences, and add the amount of time they lasted, I end up with ten years, and the war was 5 years, so but I, I assume I was there more than a year, and I remained in a monastery until the day that I perceived one day that a priest who was my teacher of catechism who I knew quite well somehow suspected that I was a Jew, and the way he tipped me off that I was at first not even aware of it, was that he corrected my Polish pronunciation, and when, and I knew that was a mistake, and he did it with a certain smirk on his face, and that night I was so anxious about it, and Mr. Godumsky, who was a , who used to be a monk, but now was in a monastery as a worker, he did uh, I told him what my feelings were, and I did hide in the organ that night.</span> <span id="s154">And that night, the Gestapo came and broke into my, we call them cells, but they were nice little rooms, the monastery was beautiful and rich and uh really beautiful place, they broke in, broke the door down, and didn't find me, and then Mr. Godumsky came where I was hidden, and we sneaked out, and went to another uh place where he had a friend, uh, whose names was Yagoginsky, with whom I communicated great deal to the present time, uh, who has then taken over and helped me afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Tell me about some of your experiences that, in your time at the monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">The monastery was really a, an experience where, where there were good things too, you know, uh, believe it or not, (laughs), my first sexual experience occurred in the monastery, not in the monastery grounds, but in the, just outside, because there were girls there from nearby who were quite interested in the boys from the monastery, uh, there were constant fear, however, of being recognized as a Jew.</span> <span id="s157">Uh, one day I, because I was nearsighted, um, I went to Krakow, and acquired glasses.</span> <span id="s158">As soon as I came in, one of my fellow seminarians looked at me and said, "Yanuk," that was my, my name, which was sort of a diminutive of John, uh said, "Oh, you look like a Jew!"</span> <span id="s159">And there was the last time I wore those glasses.</span> <span id="s160">Uh, there were many experiences that were close calls.</span> <span id="s161">For example one time I'm, one of my functions was to pick up the mail from the post office, and so I was known to everyone and they, at that time it was a village, today it's that part, that village is part of the town of Krakow, but at that time it was the village of Mogilla, and everybody knew me, and they were marching a group of Jews through the village to work at the nearby uhhhh military, German military establishment, and one of the fellows was somebody who knew me, and yelled out my name, and you know, I, I mean just unthinkingly he just yelled out and other people looked like what, what is it.</span> <span id="s162">So, you know, there were situation like that.</span> <span id="s163">Uh, Mogilla wasn't all that far from our town, uh and sometimes I encountered people who knew me from Promiehov.</span> <span id="s164">Uh, so there were many, many situations, which were quite dangerous and uh quite action...</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Tell me about the time when the head of the monastery sprinkled you incessantly with holy water.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">The Father Kuhar, who was the Prior, was a really a, a wonderful person, he was, uh, at least to my recollection, he uh maybe was six foot or six foot three, and very heavy set.</span> <span id="s167">He was not uh from Poland, he was from Yugoslavia, and he was a, a very benevolent person.</span> <span id="s168">I remember one time I was serving mass, you know, uh, I mean, I was, you know the , uh the boy who, I can't even describe it in English even though my English is relatively well, but those, the Catholic terminology is still Polish in my mind, and uh, he sprinkled me excessively uh with the holy water, and later on, I, I and I could see a twinkle in his eye, and uh later I ask him about it, and he said,with a smile, uh, in German, he said, "Zieher, zieher," which means, "Certain is certain," which was his way of now, of telling me "I know it was a lie that you are baptized, but it doesn't matter."</span> <span id="s169">We have time for one more little short story in the monastery.</span> <span id="s170">Have you got anything-- You know, Father Kuvar was a benevolent person, who helped me, who helped my mother.</span> <span id="s171">Well, my mother had black hair, black hair meant you were a Jew, my mother was on false papers, and we had to make sure that her hair was changed to sort of more blondish look, and that required transporting her from a hiding place in Krakow, and you know, bleaching your hair was not as simple as nowadays, and uh, I spoke to him about it, and what he arranged, now he had a big carriage with 2 horses, and so on, he arranged for it, he picked up my mother, I mean with a driver you know, and took her to this place in Krakow where her hair was changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">------------------Camera roll 4 just went up; Sync take 5 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">When we do this, but wait till he--------- Yes...this is not going to be a commercial for Perrier?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">I, this particular priest, who recognized at least claimed that he recognized some kind of a speech uh impediment or accent that was Jewish I believed, I was very sensitive, uh suspicious of him because I have on more than one occasion during a sermon heard him make antisemitic uh comments.</span> <span id="s177">Uh, for example, one time he was ---------- the congregation for the fact that they were doing business on Sunday, which was forbidden in Poland, anyway Poland was a strictly Catholic country, but people were doing it, selling, buying things, and he was saying "At one time, Jews were doing that, but thank God we got rid of them."</span> <span id="s178">Now, there was part of a sermon, so I uh, I knew how antisemitic he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Tell me now in general about this monastery, and all kinds of, all the kinds of things they were involved in from resistance to uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s180">They And what happened to the head of the monastery too.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">The Mogilla Monastery is uh is ------------ Monastery.</span> <span id="s182">It was a, a very, it was established in uh the beginning of the 13th Century.</span> <span id="s183">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s184">It was rich.</span> <span id="s185">It was a place of great scholarship.</span> <span id="s186">It also was a place where number of people who were in the resistance, in the Polish underground resistance, were uh, hiding under number of uh of pretexts, as workers, as priests, etc. and uh when I escaped there after they came to get me, uh later on I didn't know that Father Kuhar, the Prior, a number of others, were taken to Auschwitz, and in fact, for a long time, I thought that it was because of me.</span> <span id="s187">It turned it didn't have nothing to do with me.</span> <span id="s188">Uh, the uh, the Germans came and took the Prior and every tenth priest, and took them to Auschwitz, and then uh uh, Father Kuhar was transferred to another uh concentration camp.</span> <span id="s189">He did survive, uh after the war, and uh, in fact, I visited the monastery, uh, there is a, I brought a, a plaque, uh commemorating him.</span> <span id="s190">Uh, that is uh affixed in a very sort of a prominent place in the monastery, it's in Polish and in English, and I did establish an organization uh that uh, it's called the American Friends of Mogilla Monastery to express my gratitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">When you lived there, what was your rela--what were your duties, and what was your relationship with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">I was sort of like you would call a, an adjutant or whatever, you know, or his personal assistant.</span> <span id="s193">He trusted me particularly, uh, more than others.</span> <span id="s194">For example, he would give me the key to empty the collection boxes.</span> <span id="s195">And the was a big large church, and people would put money into the collection boxes, and in fact, to my best recollection, I was the only one that he trusted to just go in there and empty them and bring the money uh from it.</span> <span id="s196">Uh, he, mmm, I would, in fact, uh he, he was at least to me he was an older man, I remember I, I would uh cover him up at night, and I would shine his shoes too.</span> <span id="s197">Uh, he was very, very kind to me, and he, as I say, he was helpful not only to me, but he was willing to take great risks to help my mother and sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">People like him and others who helped in rescues, what were the risks?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">In Poland, to assist a Jew was very risky.</span> <span id="s200">That is, if you got apprehended, uh generally the Jew was killed, maybe taken to a camp in some situation and uhh maybe later killed.</span> <span id="s201">The Poles who were guilty of assisting Jews, uh, were often, not always, but on many occasions killed or sent to to a camp.</span> <span id="s202">In some villages, uh, the house was burned down.</span> <span id="s203">I know, for example, uh of a man who did assist my family, but that didn't have to do with our family, uh, and Mr. Kubinsky, uh whose farm was burned and his family was killed.</span> <span id="s204">It was not always the case, but there were quite a few uh, Poles who were killed.</span> <span id="s205">(Fire engine siren in background).</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Let's stop.</span> <span id="s207">We've got to stop because of the siren.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Take 6 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">I have a 2 hour interview and there's never a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Uh, how difficult was your survival from the standpoint of age.</span> <span id="s211">Can you talk about what it was like to be a teenager running under false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Well, being a teenager had certain benefits.</span> <span id="s213">Uh, you know, as a teenager, you, you feel that you are invulnerable, and you can do almost anything, and in reality, you know, so was, one was more agile.</span> <span id="s214">I could jump from a train.</span> <span id="s215">Uh, I could jump from a running streetcar or because somebody uh, made some move, whereas if I couldn't, if I was much older, I could, there were a number of situations where I have outrun police, and have outrun Germans who were shooting after me, and even with dogs.</span> <span id="s216">Now that was not, you couldn't do it unless you were 15 or 16 year old.</span> <span id="s217">So, that was an asset.</span> <span id="s218">Obviously you might uh have less of a judgment in dangerous situations because you were a teenager, but by and large, I think being teenager, considering the situation, was an asset, I believe.</span> <span id="s219">But obviously what I didn't have an adolescence, uh in in any normal sense of the term.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Can you talk about choices that Jews would have had based on age.</span> <span id="s221">Like you have more choices maybe than a 30 year old father with 2 little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Someone interviewed me once, and asked uh a very simple question: Uh, when you left the ghetto um, hmmm, uh did you say goodbye to your mother?</span> <span id="s223">(Long silence) Uh, you know, this is problem that a teenager will have, or a youngster, uh, no doubt a parent would put a child into a relative safety situation, but would not do it for himself or herself.</span> <span id="s224">Uh, you know, my mother could not, or my father leave, and say, uh, whatever will happen to the children will happen, but the other way around they did it.</span> <span id="s225">You know, one of the reasons that my father didn't leave the camp uh later on where he was because he felt uh, we needed a place where there was some sort of headquarters, maybe that wasn't the entire reason, so you know, parents had bigger responsibilities, whereas, as a youngster, you did what your parents told you, and somehow you assumed that parents in their omnipotence are going to make it, whereas parents didn't have that illusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">And what were the parents' chances versus the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Well, it had great deal to do I believe with who the parents were, adults, uh, if you talk in terms of chances, surviving, where?</span> <span id="s228">Uh, are we talking on false papers, or are we talking in hiding?</span> <span id="s229">Are we talking in a camp?</span> <span id="s230">Uh, at all phases, uh, there were accidental factors and there were factors that had to do with the personality.</span> <span id="s231">Certainly, if you were a man, you had less chances to survive out on false papers because you would be so readily identified as a Jew by the fact that you were circumcised, whereas you couldn't absolutely prove it uh to a to a woman.</span> <span id="s232">And that uh again, that had to do also, at what point.</span> <span id="s233">You see, time is a tremendous factor here.</span> <span id="s234">It was so different in 19 uh late in 1942, than it was in 43 and when you get to 44 becomes impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">We have to reload.</span> <span id="s236">That's a good point.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Let's finish talking about that.</span> <span id="s239">How different were conditions in during different years over the course of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">The chances for survival depended upon at what point in time, uh, a Jew found himself, and, and various situation, be it on false papers, be it in hiding, uh, be it in, in a camp.</span> <span id="s241">First of all, uh, personal resources were exhausted.</span> <span id="s242">For example, in, in our case, my mother and sister and I, even though separate, we were on false papers.</span> <span id="s243">Our resources were exhausted in terms of money even, having some, uh, in terms of having people that we could rely upon.</span> <span id="s244">Now, you have some contacts.</span> <span id="s245">Those get exhausted.</span> <span id="s246">So that the longer it lasted, the less chances that that one have for survival.</span> <span id="s247">The same thing was true in camp.</span> <span id="s248">Uh, you know, a, a, if a camp was liberated a week sooner, many more people would have survived.</span> <span id="s249">Uh, if the war ended six months earlier, a great many more would have survived.</span> <span id="s250">Remember that the Germans were so dedicated to the uh Final Solution of the Jewish question, that to the last minute, they were diligently working on this project.</span> <span id="s251">So there, the more time, it was really fighting for time.</span> <span id="s252">Every day, every hour, mattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Can you give me a general picture of how you survived from when you left the monastery until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s254">The kinds of things you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">After I escaped the monastery, I lived with this young man, who was on false papers himself.</span> <span id="s256">He was not a Jew, but he was a underground fighter.</span> <span id="s257">His name, his real name was Stefan Yagoginski, and he lives to this day.</span> <span id="s258">Uh, he and I lived together, he pretended that I was his uh nephew, and uh, he worked, he was repairing an organ in a large village.</span> <span id="s259">There was nothing wrong with the organ, but that was the cover, he was working on repairing the church organ because his father owned a factory of organs and there was the connection, and he and I, and I was assisting him in it.</span> <span id="s260">But then also, we had no funds, I had no funds anymore, no money, and we smuggled, we smuggled food from the villages surrounding Krakow to uh you know, to Krakow, and then we smuggled uh food to Warsaw, which was dangerous, and we smuggled from Warsaw, a, a Vodka, but not the real Vodka, but called, it was called Bimber, which was like Moonshine.</span> <span id="s261">That certainly was punishable by death.</span> <span id="s262">Uh, in fact, I was in Warsaw smuggling Bimber when uh when the Warsaw ghetto uprising started.</span> <span id="s263">I remember like today I, we were there, Stefan and I, uh, and then, it became increasingly too dangerous and through some contacts, we found out that one could uh, escape to Hungary.</span> <span id="s264">And Hungary at that time from what I was told, was really like paradise to us, and we did manage to escape to Hungary, and that's a long story, it was, it had, we had to cross a border, we got uh apprehended, escape, it was a complicated situation, and we did uh arrive in Hungary in 1943, sometimes in fall.</span> <span id="s265">My mother, sister, and, and I, and a childhood girlfriend of mine, whose father was killed in a camp.</span> <span id="s266">My father knew where he was, where she, where the girl was, her name was Gina, and we arrived in Hungary, and we were there as Poles on false papers, but in March of 44, the Germans occupied Hungary also.</span> <span id="s267">So the whole same situation started again.</span> <span id="s268">I attempted to escape with a Jewish underground group to Rumania, because there was a connection to Palestine at that time, but got apprehended on the border between Hungary and Romania.</span> <span id="s269">Hungary was occupied.</span> <span id="s270">Rumania was not.</span> <span id="s271">And I was taken to a camp in Yugoslavia, and then from that camp, I was transported to a prison in Budapest.</span> <span id="s272">In fact it was the prison where the famous Hanna Schenish was, she was on the same floor where I was, and I managed to escape from there with help of, of, of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Tell me about the escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">The escape really occurred through assistance of a , a Gestapo man, who was of, who was sort of half German, uh and half Yugoslavian, and I was in a, uh, and I do take credit for that, I established the contact with him, and I trusted him.</span> <span id="s275">Uh, uh, and uh, which was risk, because I gave him my mother's address, and my mother was still in Budapest on false papers.</span> <span id="s276">And I, I established, you know, contact with him while we were in this prison, uh, he could have been just playing me for a sucker, you know, uh, but I trusted him and it turned out he really engineered the escape.</span> <span id="s277">I mean, it's a long story, but it was his doing, and he engineered the escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">What was, when you said you were there at the beginning of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Oh no, I was only that day.</span> <span id="s280">I was that one day when the Warsaw ghetto uprising started, it so happened that Stefan and I were just making one of our periodic trips to pick up the, the moonshine.</span> <span id="s281">And it was, suddenly there was tremendous amount of activity, uh shooting and so on.</span> <span id="s282">There was something going on, and we heard that there was a an uprising in Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">So you just left?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Oh, we just left, we left in a in a great hurry.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Can you talk about what you think survival is a matter of?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Of, what made difference in survival were the personal uh qualities of the individuals.</span> <span id="s287">There were many other factors, but everything else being equal, unless you were a person who had a tremendous will to survive, who had courage, resourcefulness, and uh, uh all the other factors wouldn't help.</span> <span id="s288">Now, sure you needed luck.</span> <span id="s289">And you needed uh assistance of other people, but your personal qualities determined, and I am saying it not only on false papers, uh, people who survived in camps didn't survive by accident.</span> <span id="s290">Uh, every one, I believe, every survivor, uh in my view, and that is maybe is sort of an over--no I don't think it is, is really a hero.</span> <span id="s291">And survivors hate that kind of a term.</span> <span id="s292">They avoid it because they don't want to take responsibility for their survival, and it took my great many years in, in analysis to recognize that I survived uh thanks not only to the help of others, but thanks to my own activities, which makes me responsible for my survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">You once talked about being accused of being a survivor, an accusation that you're a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Survivors have been greeted with a great deal of ambivalence from the very beginning, uh, and in particular, uh, by fellow Jews, who , because survivors, in the eyes of Jews, were suspect.</span> <span id="s295">How did you survive?</span> <span id="s296">That was the question.</span> <span id="s297">You know, what kind of evil deeds did you commit in order to survive.</span> <span id="s298">You were sort of contaminated uh, you know the Nazis, the only good Jew is a dead Jew, and in a way, after the war immediately I believe, that was also a view of others.</span> <span id="s299">The, the dead people, they were the victims, the survivors were somehow suspect.</span> <span id="s300">And you know, to this day, there are all kind of memorials for everybody, Warsaw ghetto fighters, they, you have a kibbutz honoring the fighters of Warsaw ghetto, but you, you have streets named after fighters of Warsaw ghetto, but who talks about survivors?</span> <span id="s301">You know, what kind of, what avenue or what monument has been, and yet survivors accomplished a great deal more than the fighters of Warsaw ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s302">So they killed a few Germans.</span> <span id="s303">So what.</span> <span id="s304">That doesn't impress me at all.</span> <span id="s305">I am much more impressed with a group of young men and women in Budapest who assisted people in surviving, who risked, the Jews who risked their lives to help other Jews survive.</span> <span id="s306">They are much bigger heroes to me than the figh--fighters of Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Okay, we have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">We ran out before you finished that last thought, so I just want you to do something that sort of answers the question who you feel are the real heroes who really risked their lives.</span> <span id="s310">People who helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">During this whole terrible period, there were Jews, in addition to others, who risked their lives to help other Jews.</span> <span id="s312">In my own situation in, in Budapest, for example, or in, in Krakow, but in Budapest particularly, there was a group of young men and women, who risked their lives day in and day out to assist other Jews, who worked on false papers, who smuggled money, and all they, they did this all to have others survive, and I am alive thanks to them.</span> <span id="s313">They're not celebrated as heroes, uh, but the group in Warsaw Ghetto, who decided to commit a collective suicide and succeeded in the process of killing a few Germans, are, are celebrated, and, and I wonder why, why that is, why don't we celebrate survivors, why don't we help those, why don't we celebrate those who have assisted other Jews to survive.</span> <span id="s314">I think in part, at least that's my own answer to this question, is that we have sort of identified with this militaristic age, where it really matters uh not if you preserve life, but if you destroy the enemy.</span> <span id="s315">When I first went to Yad Vashem many years ago, and as I walked in there, which isn't true anymore, the first thing you saw was a bigger than life picture of some Jews with guns, with, you know, as if this was the big deal.</span> <span id="s316">That didn't matter.</span> <span id="s317">It didn't ever impress me that some Jew during the war years managed to get a gun.</span> <span id="s318">That didn't accomplish anything.</span> <span id="s319">So you got, you killed one German or two or three, so what!</span> <span id="s320">I'm much more impressed with the fact that someone had the strength, the courage to survive, the courage to endure, the courage to endure, that really is what matters.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Do you think there are close calls that you had, that you can think of that we should talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Oh, I had great many close calls, and you know, one of the sort of funny part of it is, that in Europe, there was great deal of literature on Indian lore written by a German called Karl May, who never was in America, who never saw an Indian, who, in fact, wrote his books in prison.</span> <span id="s323">But we lived on those books as kids, and I knew them and read them, and let me tell you, reading those books helped me a number of times to survive.</span> <span id="s324">When we were crossing the border from um, uh, Poland into Slovakia, we suddenly, when it was pitch dark and we had uh guides, and suddenly there were lights, dogs, and shots, and we uh, I first ran, you know, I was with my mother's sister and this girl, Gina, and obviously I could run the fastest, I had, but then I realized my mother and sister would be caught, and I could hear from a distance that there were also dogs there, and you know, my, what I have read about Indian lore and all that, I shoved my mother, there was a river nearby, as she approached, and my sister and Gina had then jumped after them, and walked against the stream, forced them, my mother was terrified, and that really saved our lives, at that particular time, and then we did hide, and the guides who escaped, they were mountain people uh from Poland, they came and found us, you know.</span> <span id="s325">Now, these are strange things, and there were many other similar situations where, they're just in a way bizarre in nature.</span> <span id="s326">But...one relied upon uh one's resourcefulness, really, I have to come back to the same term.</span> <span id="s327">One could not survive without uh wanting to live no matter what and also being resourceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">You told a story of the Gestapo asking for volunteers for execution.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Yes, I I was in----------, and they told us, it was a makeshift prison, a Gestapo prison, uh, and three of our group escaped, and they came in.</span> <span id="s330">In fact, I see it like before my eyes today, the the chief of Gestapo came in with his white gloves and stood there hitting with the white gloves on the bars asking, we were beaten before quite a bit, but we were lined up and standing, asking for volunteers for execution.</span> <span id="s331">And, uh, a friend of mine, who, who I, his name I remember to this day, many names I don't remember, was Sonik, he volunteered first.</span> <span id="s332">He was depressed, and he really didn't want to live.</span> <span id="s333">I volunteered second, but I assure you it wasn't because I wanted to die.</span> <span id="s334">It was because I believed that they would not execute those who volunteered.</span> <span id="s335">It was too simple.</span> <span id="s336">They wouldn't do the (clears throat) the normal things you uh, who volunteered for execution would after all be the one who was not an escape risk, and I was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Tell me about the letter that man brought you from your father when he was in Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">When I was in monastery, one day I was told that somebody is at the gate, who was, uh asking for me, and as I approached there, I could see a young man who clearly looked Jewish, and he handed me a letter, and it was a letter from uh from my father, who was in the uh, which was uh the airport.</span> <span id="s339">This was the name of the camp really, but it was called the airport.</span> <span id="s340">Jews worked on that airport, and my father said, "You have to help this young man.</span> <span id="s341">He has to survive," and uh, they were trying to get some papers for him, and he was going to have a contact.</span> <span id="s342">Anyway, I did hide him in my cell, under, in my room, I brought him food, and I did keep him for a few days.</span> <span id="s343">Uh, I can't tell you exactly how uh long, but not very long.</span> <span id="s344">And, uh, he did tell me that he escaped from Treblinka, and described to me what he did see and how he escaped, and you know, for many years I forgot it.</span> <span id="s345">I remembered it in my analysis.</span> <span id="s346">And, incidentally, he did not survive.</span> <span id="s347">His, a, a relative of his did survive, and I did get in, in touch with her.</span> <span id="s348">I know about her.</span> <span id="s349">Her name is, she lives in Switzerland, but he did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Do you feel that people would do anything at all in order to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">No.</span> <span id="s352">No.</span> <span id="s353">I think that in terms, I think that people uh showed conscience, uh.</span> <span id="s354">(He may be crying here).</span> <span id="s355">No.</span> <span id="s356">What I did want to say is um, when I was arrested by Gestapo, and I was in in this camp, uh, my mother, who was in Budapest at the time (long pause) um, was approached that if she become an informer, they would rescue me, they would get me, which wasn't, incidentally, true, but it was a set-up, she was on false papers, and she, she uh refused.</span> <span id="s357">And I'm proud of it (crying).</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Thanks.</span> <span id="s359">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">At least certain things without becoming overwhelmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">---------------for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">The following is 30 seconds of interview for previous interview with Emanuel Tanay.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Are you rolling?</span></p> <p><span
