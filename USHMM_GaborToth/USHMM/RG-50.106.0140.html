edict.</span> <span id="s19">And it’s also the first social service -- like a -- where people are taken care of in the world.</span> <span id="s20">Most economists know about it, it’s a family of the

Reform movement.</span> <span id="s23">There was no Conservative movement, which started, I believe in the United States, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What were the relations like between the -- the Jews and the Germans when you were very little?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: When I was very little my father owned a furniture store and my grandmother owned -- we lived in the suburbs, actually, in a place called Grigg saba at the end of the streetcar line and the store was part of our home.</span> <span id="s26">And the store was on the side and then we had a house like next door to it.</span> <span id="s27">And my grandmother owned, with her brother, a very large section of apartment buildings, with a big furniture store in it downtown.</span> <span id="s28">And they were respected business people, the Mandl family, you know, for hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s29">And we led a very, very wonderful life, a very nice life.</span> <span id="s30">My -- my mother and father couldn’t vacation together because he ran the store, but my father would go off, I remember, to -- to Italy and to France and one time to the United States.</span> <span id="s31">And then I would go with my mother like to Baden-Baden where my grandmother would summer.</span> <span id="s32">It was a very easy life.</span> <span id="s33">On Sundays we’d go to -- there was a small like a zoo, with the cafés an -- and there was a synagogue also in the s -- in the suburb there, which is where we went.</span> <span id="s34">And my m -- we were -- my mother kept kosher.</span> <span id="s35">We were Orthodox and we had an excellent life.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: My father’s name was Siegfried Mandle, and my mother’s name was Rita Mandle.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Has your father ever served in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My father was a volunteer in the first World War, and I believe he worked in a barn shoveling manure.</span> <span id="s40">He was 17 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What work did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: My mother -- in those days there were two servants and my mother -- my mother did the cooking.</span> <span id="s43">The German hausfrau prided herself on her cooking.</span> <span id="s44">And took care of me and I -- and I guess she was in the store once in awhile.</span> <span id="s45">But I was an only child.</span> <span id="s46">And she had a sister in town and a lot of friends, you know, and lived a very nice life.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Was Rita.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: You mentioned that your family was Orthodox, can you tell me specifically what religious traditions your family observed?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Orthodox in the sense that all the holidays were kept, but the store was open on Saturdays because it had to be.</span> <span id="s51">But -- and strictly kosher and my mo -- and we always had Friday night services, you know, at home and went to synagogue on -- on Saturdays, at least my mother and I did.</span> <span id="s52">And I don’t remember if my father did or not, but Orthodox in the sense that that’s all that was known.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you have a favorite holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Oh, I guess -- I guess -- I guess it was Passover, Pesach, because we always had Seders, you know, the whole, long Seders.</span> <span id="s55">And this was always kept up, the traditions in -- when we wa -- when we came to the United States too, and whenever possible.</span> <span id="s56">I was brought up in -- in a very Jewish feeling home.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I was not allowed to go to the regular schools.</span> <span id="s59">There were no Jewish children allowed in the Jewish -- regular schools.</span> <span id="s60">I started -- I started out that there was a -- a teacher in that small synagogue there in the suburb.</span> <span id="s61">And then I started going downtown to the big synagogue, very, very famous art deco synagogue that -- and that’s where I went with the other Jewish children.</span> <span id="s62">And I was only -- what was it?</span> <span id="s63">Well, I was born in 1930, so I -- I was -- Kristallnacht I was eight years old.</span> <span id="s64">But -- but from the time I started school I -- I couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s65">None of the Jewish children could go to regular school.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did you ever have any German friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah, I had -- I had German -- the children next door and other children.</span> <span id="s68">I had German little girls, but that had to stop too.</span> <span id="s69">They weren't allowed to play with me any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: What kinds of things did you do for fun when you were a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: We had a big backyard with swings and we would swing and we would go to that -- to the zoo and the circus, I loved the circus, my father would take -- took me to the circus and swimming.</span> <span id="s72">I had swimming lessons.</span> <span id="s73">And wi -- the way they -- they gave swimming lessons those days, they put a harness on the kid and like hel-held -- held -- held you by a rope and dropped you in the water and you learned to swim.</span> <span id="s74">And we were allowed -- but that had to stop, too.</span> <span id="s75">This is when I was five or six years old, but then we weren’t there because there was a municipal swimming pool.</span> <span id="s76">And my father had a motorcycle, I remember riding around on the motorcycle with him, which I didn’t like very much.</span> <span id="s77">But I was a very studious child, I read a lot.</span> <span id="s78">And that was fun to me, and th -- I guess -- you know, it was so long ago, I’m 70 years old, so that’s about it at remembering the fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Do you have any memories from before Hitler was in power?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Well, these things that I’m talking about now were be-before.</span> <span id="s81">Yo-You mean when I was two, three, four years old?</span> <span id="s82">I spent a lot of time with my grandmother, who was -- when I was real little she li -- she lived upstairs.</span> <span id="s83">It was a big house and I guess my mother wasn’t too happy about having her mother-in-law live with her, but it was a very formal life.</span> <span id="s84">I would have to go upstairs every morning and curtsy and say good morning to my grandmother and we went for walks and we were -- it was a very structured life in -- in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s85">And children were seen and not heard, you know, so that -- that’s what I re -- you know, remember.</span> <span id="s86">I know I was registered at a -- at a -- a Swiss finishing school for -- where I was supposed to go when I was like 14 or 15, and -- because my parents were, you know, of the wealthier -- wealthier position because of being business people.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What anti-Semitic experiences do you remember from your early childhood?</span> <span id="s88">You mentioned th-the swimming had to stop.</span> <span id="s89">Wha-What --</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Well, that I couldn’t play.</span> <span id="s91">That -- that I couldn’t play with the other children, and when I knocked on the door I was told, Gretchen can’t play with you, you know, don’t come back.</span> <span id="s92">And I don’t know if we’re jumping ahead, but after Kristallnacht, when -- I -- I -- I don’t know how I ended up at the downtown school anyway, which was the synagogue, the big synagogue, but the Nazis were there with -- with -- with the dogs and had -- were setting fire to the books that were inside, I guess the schoolrooms and the library from -- from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s93">You know, and they’re saying get out of here, go back, go home.</span> <span id="s94">Because the streetcar line ended and was just a straight run.</span> <span id="s95">And even at that age, at -- at age eight, I guess I went on the streetcar and went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Let me keep you back a little big younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Let -- let’s not go quite yet.</span> <span id="s99">What did your parents say to you when you went to your friends and they said go away, you can’t play?</span> <span id="s100">How did your parents explain the situation to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: They explained it that we have to obey, because it can be very dangerous if we don’t, and that I shouldn’t ask questions and that I have to do what I’m told.</span> <span id="s102">But it was the type of upbringing anyway where -- where you were obedient, so it wasn’t that hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Do you remember seeing any anti-Semitic posters or newspapers or anything like that when you were very little?</span> <span id="s104">A: No, no, I have no memory of any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Did you ever hear your parents talk about the political and social situation in Germany?</span> <span id="s106">Did they ever talk amongst themselves with you just kind of around, and could hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No, I have no memory -- no, I have no memory of that.</span> <span id="s108">I think that children were not to be worried and that it was -- I -- I knew -- my -- my memory really, concrete memory is more right aft-after Kristallnacht or -- or right -- right before, and the things that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Before Kristallnacht, how much did you actually understand about what was happening around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I really didn’t know, really, or didn’t understand much and didn’t know much.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did you ever hear your parents discuss plans to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Oh yes, oh yes, I knew that we were planning to leave Germany, because my mother shopped and shopped, including shoes for me for when I would be twe -- 10 - 12 years old.</span> <span id="s113">They were buying Leica cameras to se -- resell in the United States because the lift van was going to come and it would get filled with all our household goods and that we were going to America, and -- because my mother’s brother was here and we -- that’s where we were going.</span> <span id="s114">And that was the talk, waiting -- waiting for the -- for the number to come up and you know, the vi -- the -- what was it called where you’re waiting for -- for your -- you had a number in order to get out, but that I knew, that -- and I also knew that my mother was going to -- and this was again, before Kristallnacht, was going to Munich twice a week to take cooking lessons at -- at a -- there was a -- like a chapter of the Cordon Bleu there, because, you know, they had no idea about America, that they were -- she thought she could become a cook here because she was a very famous cook in -- in Augsburg, you know, in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s115">And my father had come to the 1938 World’s Fair earlier in -- in -- in the year and had taken -- and had arranged for the visas with my mother’s brother, who came in 1933.</span> <span id="s116">And so I knew -- I knew -- that I knew about, I knew about America.</span> <span id="s117">And they were taking English lessons also.</span> <span id="s118">They didn’t learn much, but they took English lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did they have any problems with getting the American paperwork?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: They -- they had -- they had the visa and they had th-the number, but it was not due for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s121">In other words, we couldn’t leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Can you explain the lift van?</span> <span id="s123">You said there was a lift van coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Can you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah, a lift -- lift van is -- is the same as a container on a -- on a -- on a freighter.</span> <span id="s127">It’s a great big, wooden box and all the belongings are put in it and -- and those lift vans were -- for most people they were sent at -- for storage to Holland.</span> <span id="s128">And then the idea was that when you got -- were going to go to wherever you were going to emigrate to, they would then be shipped.</span> <span id="s129">And people paid storage and people paid freight, and there was many, many storehouses in Holland that had these lift vans and they were filled with all your belongings and -- and hopefully things that -- furniture and clothing and books and -- and everything that you had, hoping for the life in the -- wherever your next haven would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did you ever see Hitler or hear him speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s132">I was at my grandmother’s where, as I said, she lived right downtown on Bahnhof Skazie, which means -- Bahnhof is -- is the railroad station, the main street like -- be like Fifth Avenue in New York.</span> <span id="s133">And sh -- we looked out from behind her lace curtains -- she lived, I think on the third or fourth floor, an apartment building.</span> <span id="s134">And we were crouching down, she said, I want you to see th -- see this, this is history.</span> <span id="s135">We’re not supposed to be looking, you weren't supposed to look out.</span> <span id="s136">But that -- that’s the evil man, that’s Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s137">And I saw him in his car, in his open car, just like in the movies, with the hand upraised.</span> <span id="s138">And I wa -- I was frightened.</span> <span id="s139">I was very, very frightened, because it was so menacing.</span> <span id="s140">Well, it was all the accoutrements, you know, that was with him, all the staff cars and everything else.</span> <span id="s141">So yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Wh-Why was it dangerous to be looking at him?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: I guess there was a rule that Jews weren’t supposed to -- to be looking a -- looking at him.</span> <span id="s144">You know, weren’t supposed to view him.</span> <span id="s145">Maybe they were afraid we’d get shot at or something, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: When did things start to get really very bad for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Things got really bad -- well, I th -- I -- I’m not quite sure, but I think my father had to close up the store maybe three, four, six months before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s148">But people still, because they were so well known -- maybe it was even longer than that, people would come and pay their bills like behind closed doors, because Jews at that time already, their bank accounts were con -- confiscated.</span> <span id="s149">And I -- but because the good relationship that my family had with the town and with -- with -- with the cities, that’s who we got along.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What do you remember of Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I remember the -- the house had shutters on the outside and my parents closed the shutters and I -- they pulled me into bed with them.</span> <span id="s152">Or maybe I got so frightened at the noises that I went, crawled into their bed with them.</span> <span id="s153">But they were throwing rocks, and the store had big shutters too, so they were trying to break down the door.</span> <span id="s154">And then the next morning the -- in -- in Germany -- because it was all very old-fashioned, the milk was brought by a milkmaid, she had like a -- a -- a little wagon with a th -- I think a dog pulling it or something.</span> <span id="s155">And these metal containers of milk and the housewife would come out with her pitcher of milk and then you filled -- filled the milk.</span> <span id="s156">And was -- I don’t know, seven, eight o’clock in the morning and I was -- must have been about seven, because I was dressed for school.</span> <span id="s157">And my mother told me to go to the door and you know, get -- get the milk.</span> <span id="s158">And it was not the milkmaid, it was two SS men.</span> <span id="s159">And they said, where’s your father?</span> <span id="s160">And I said, he -- he was still upstairs.</span> <span id="s161">And they said, where’s your mother and they like pushed me aside and then came into the house.</span> <span id="s162">And my mother -- and they wanted to go upstairs, my mother said, I’ll get him, you know, don’t go upstair -- and -- and they ki -- my mother went upstairs and got my father and he came down, and meanwhile, they took all but her wedding band, she had, I guess, I diamond ring.</span> <span id="s163">Took the rings off of her, but they didn’t take her -- her -- her -- her wedding band at that point.</span> <span id="s164">And my father disappeared.</span> <span id="s165">And they took him away and they said they’re just taking him to the police station in Augsburg, in -- and that’s -- that’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Had you ever heard of Dachau before that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, I’d never heard of Dachau, but that’s where my father ended up.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: How long was he interned there?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: He was in Dachau til the end of March.</span> <span id="s170">And the reason that he got out was because he had been a volunteer in the first World War, and because of the family’s long, long, long established times in Germany, and because we had the emigration number.</span> <span id="s171">So he got out and he -- they le -- they let him out and he’s still in the striped uniform, shaved head and he called my grandmother on the telephone, and I remember he came home and he was never the same again.</span> <span id="s172">My fa -- my father had terrible time holding a job in the United States and he -- he was -- he was not a stable person.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: A couple of questions.</span> <span id="s174">Do you know under what circumstances or what conditions he was released?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: He was released under the condition that we had to leave Germany within three weeks.</span> <span id="s176">And the neighbors on the other side told him that if we’re not gone that he would never -- never be able to leave and that they were going to put him back, you know, put him in a camp permanently.</span> <span id="s177">So at that point we left -- we left with -- within two weeks, because as I said, the lift van was gone and the -- the house was -- was relatively empty of -- of -- of furniture.</span> <span id="s178">And we went to -- no, I think what happened, the lift van was all new furniture, because we were in the furniture business, he was in the furniture business, a lift van that was all new furniture to come to America and the things in the house were left.</span> <span id="s179">We were still living in -- in the house, because th -- they were going to wait for -- for their emigration number and we went to England to wait out the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Do you know what arrangements had been made for your family to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: The arrangements were that my father had been sending some money to a Swiss bank account, so -- just in case.</span> <span id="s182">I don’t know whether it was for England or to help when we came to America.</span> <span id="s183">And that’s the arrangements were, so that we were able to -- to live.</span> <span id="s184">And first class boat tickets on the -- at -- with a shipping company, you know, a boat company, had been purchased, but not for a specific ship, because they didn’t know when our number was going to come up.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Can you tell me the state of your father’s physical health when he was released?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: He looked like an old man.</span> <span id="s187">He was born in year 1900, so that made him 38 years old, only.</span> <span id="s188">And he -- he looked like an old man.</span> <span id="s189">He told some -- I don’t know if you want me to talk about this, some stories, I remember, from being in Dachau and what it was like then already.</span> <span id="s190">Do you want me to go ahead with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: When -- did he tell you at that time, or much later?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Later.</span> <span id="s193">That h-he said he always believed in -- in -- in kismet.</span> <span id="s194">In -- In -- in fortune that you didn’t know was ga -- th-they were standing in line, they had -- now, this was November, December.</span> <span id="s195">They were standing in line with just those striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s196">Oh, I have to add, Dachau -- at that point there were no concentration camps, it -- it was really a camp for criminals and political prisoners and not as you think of -- they quickly learned how to make it worse.</span> <span id="s197">And they got potato peelings and -- and herring, salt herring to eat.</span> <span id="s198">And stale bread.</span> <span id="s199">They learned very quickly how to tr -- to treat the Jews.</span> <span id="s200">And they were standing in line and the man next to him said, trade places with me.</span> <span id="s201">I feel -- I feel unlucky, or I feel lucky.</span> <span id="s202">Because they were -- they were going to shoot every fifth man, or threatened to shoot every fifth man.</span> <span id="s203">And my father, I guess believed in -- in whatever will be, will be, and he traded places with him.</span> <span id="s204">And that man was shot.</span> <span id="s205">And life was terrible, it -- it was absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s206">How they knew s -- at that stage already to treat people like i -- like animals, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s207">And I think they used as wardens some of -- some of the political prisoners, a-and so -- some of the actual thieves and like that, to be the bosses ov-over the -- th-the political prisoners, th-the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: What do you remember about the process of packing up and leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I remember being -- going on a train and we went via Holland.</span> <span id="s210">And when we got to the border, the conductor coming and saying, you’re now free, you’re now free.</span> <span id="s211">And, little girl, you’re now free.</span> <span id="s212">And th -- I was also told during the journey to the border to Holland that -- how to behave myself, not say anything.</span> <span id="s213">And the fright, I still remember the fright of my parents, you know, that -- of being put off at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: What could you take with you?</span> <span id="s215">You, personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I personally had my autograph book, which in those days, Germans being German, everything is very serious, so it isn’t like these funny stuff that’s written in the ki -- kid’s autograph book here.</span> <span id="s217">This is your aunt, your uncles, your teachers, your grandparents, write very serious, like hopes for your future and draw pictures and your friends put like these black paper cut-outs or -- or pictures of roses and write -- it’s amazing what -- what eight, nine year old children wrote in this book, and -- and my teachers and -- and as I said, my grandmother and -- and -- and my -- my uncle, a-and that is really all that I had, which now the museum has and which is now in Yad Vashem on display, part of the display, which makes me very proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: I have to pause now to change tapes.</span> <span id="s219">One moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: -- uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Brigitte Freidin.</span> <span id="s222">This is tape number one, side B, and you were just telling me about taking an autograph book and you mentioned that some of your friends had written in it.</span> <span id="s223">Were you able to say goodbye to your friends before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes, I -- I was able to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s225">I remember that it was very, very, very sad and a lot of crying and a lot of hugging.</span> <span id="s226">And I think that the saddest was saying goodbye to my grandmother and my uncle.</span> <span id="s227">My grandmother would not come because her -- she was in partnership with a s -- brother -- her brother, who had never married.</span> <span id="s228">And it’s the typical story, they were afraid that -- they didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s229">They didn’t believe it and they didn't want to just close the stores and they didn't want to lose all that money, they didn’t want to lose all that property.</span> <span id="s230">And like it couldn’t be, not -- not with their history in -- in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s231">And she wouldn’t -- she refused to leave.</span> <span id="s232">I have some letters that she wrote to -- I have one living relative, my father’s brother has a daughter whose name is Ruth, and they live in Sao Paolo, Brazil and she wrote to -- letters to them, which my cousin has given me copies of, about how she was only worried about them and about us getting to freedom and that she -- she didn’t think that she’d see any of us, you know, again.</span> <span id="s233">And she was a very important person in -- in my life, my grandmother, because my mother’s -- I had no other grandparents.</span> <span id="s234">My father’s father died when he was 19, so she was the great matriarch.</span> <span id="s235">And my mother’s father died a year before I was born and her mother died a year after I was born, so there were no -- no grandparents except this one grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What kinds of things did you say to each other when you said goodbye to your -- your family and your friends, what did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I really don’t -- that’s -- has no relevancy for me.</span> <span id="s238">You know, I -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did anything happen in the time between your father’s release and your departure from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I was confined to the house, I could not go to school any more, and I was -- and I -- a -- I don’t think I had any more schooling after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s241">I stayed pretty much with my mother.</span> <span id="s242">My mother also went to Nazi headquarters and was thrown down the stairs, where she asked -- tried to find out what was happening to my father.</span> <span id="s243">I also know that she sent packages with long underwear and -- and -- and food to Dachau, they were told they could send it.</span> <span id="s244">And I don’t know if it was through the Red Cross or through -- or just regular German channels, and he never got any of it.</span> <span id="s245">That’s the things that I remember, but I -- I was -- I was really kept at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: What do you remember about the day, the actual day that you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I-I just remember being bundled up in a coat and -- and -- and that we were going.</span> <span id="s248">You know, I -- I -- I remember more the train journey.</span> <span id="s249">You know, I’d never been on -- well, I’d been to Baden-Baden and I guess to Munich, which is only 40 miles away, but that I was going on this long, long journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: And your first stop, where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Our first stop was, I think in -- must have been li -- LaHavre, must have been in France.</span> <span id="s252">And then to get to England to get to -- because we were going to London --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: You took the train straight from Germany to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Right, to -- to France, an-and then took the boat from la -- LaHavre to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: How long were you in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: To Southampton.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: How long were you in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: We -- we were -- we went directly, just -- just like a day.</span> <span id="s259">We didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s260">We -- we were going.</span> <span id="s261">Or, if there was a way -- there was no way.</span> <span id="s262">You couldn’t have gone from Holland.</span> <span id="s263">W-We must have stayed on the boat -- I mean, on the train.</span> <span id="s264">I think the only way to have gotten there was -- I-I’m guessing at this, I really -- I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Do you remember boarding the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: The ship was much, much later when we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s267">You talking about coming in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Oh, okay, so you went first to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: We lived in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s271">So you went from LaHavre to Southampton.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And how did you cross the channel?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: It -- must have bi -- crossed on -- on -- on a ship.</span> <span id="s275">No, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s276">I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Tell me about your -- your arrival in England and -- and what that was like for you personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: That I remember.</span> <span id="s279">I remember we w -- we went by train from Southampton to London, and my father had a first cousin by the name of Alfred Marx, who was ha -- who was there already, and he had -- he had two daughters.</span> <span id="s280">And he had a brother the name of Sigmund Marx.</span> <span id="s281">They were waiting for us at, I guess, the train station in London, and they had gotten us a room in -- near Green Park in -- in London, in somebody’s apartment.</span> <span id="s282">And I slept on a cot.</span> <span id="s283">My parents went to Portobello Road and got a second hand cot and it was filled with bedbugs.</span> <span id="s284">And I slept on that at the foot of my parent’s bed, and we lived in that one room.</span> <span id="s285">And my mother registered me in school, and I went to the regular English -- English schools.</span> <span id="s286">And I played mostly with my cousins, because you know, I’d -- I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s287">And my mother worked as a maid, because you were not allowed to come to England if you took a job while you were waiting for your emigration number.</span> <span id="s288">So the little bit of money they in the sw -- from Switzerland helped, I guess, pay for our food and -- and -- and -- and this room, and -- but by working as a maid, she got paid, you know, like -- like illegal immigrants do here, under the table, as they say.</span> <span id="s289">And that’s the amazing thing, what -- what these refugees were willing to do from the type of homes and the type of -- of life that they led, in order to exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: While you were in England, did you experience any anti-Semitism or any anti-foreign sentiment?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Ah, no, no.</span> <span id="s292">I went to school with the -- where -- with -- with the children and I -- I don’t remember any -- any anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How long did it take you to learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Well, the way that I learned English is that two weeks before the war started, which was in September, all the British -- London, Manchester, all the major cities, the schoolchildren were sent to the country, voluntarily.</span> <span id="s295">And how my mother and father found out about this, I will never know, but off I was packed, with my book bag on my back and a li -- and a little -- little suitcase and was sent off to the countryside to a place called Saint Ippolyts, which is now part of Ipswich, to stay with a family called the Palmers and that’s where I really learned English, because it’s total immersion.</span> <span id="s296">I was supposed to be with my two girl cousins and we got separated and I wasn’t in the same village with them, so I was totally by myself on my own, nine years old.</span> <span id="s297">At that time already, tho -- that netting with -- with -- with the, like balloons was all over London, I do remember that, before the war.</span> <span id="s298">They thought they could stop the bombs with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Do you remember how your parents explained to you about your leaving and why it was important that you leave them?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: They explained to me that they will come and get me, we are going to America, but in order for them not to worry about me, they wanted me where I would be safe, because they could that way better take care of themselves, and they wanted me safe.</span> <span id="s301">So I went.</span> <span id="s302">You -- you know, I was a child, you did what you were told.</span> <span id="s303">And I don’t -- I don’t even remember particularly crying or -- or -- or -- or anything.</span> <span id="s304">I just went.</span> <span id="s305">Maybe I thought it was ma -- maybe that’s where my love of travel -- I travel constantly -- came from, that, hey, was a new place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: How did you learn about the German invasion of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, that’s why, because we knew that war was imminent in England because of that Ge-German invasion of Poland and England was preparing to go to war, and that’s why I was sent to the country, along with all these other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Let me make sure I’m understanding.</span> <span id="s311">So what you’re saying is at the very beginning of September, you were sent to the countryside?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes, two weeks before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So when you’re referring to the day that the war started, you’re talking about the date that England --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: England went to war.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And what were your thoughts when war was declared in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I was in the country already and I think I was still getting used to -- to the life there, which was totally different than anything that I knew, that I didn’t remember.</span> <span id="s319">And in a -- already we -- even a -- even in school in England, we had to do air raid drills and we had gas masks.</span> <span id="s320">And so it was -- it was already like a given, you know, it was -- it was part of your life.</span> <span id="s321">And we had ditches that were dug that we -- I remember the planes coming over and we had to dive into the ditches.</span> <span id="s322">And we had -- and go under the desks at -- at school, because I went to the country school there, of course, in -- in Saint Ippolyts.</span> <span id="s323">And so i-it -- it -- it just becomes part of your life, part of the way you have to live.</span> <span id="s324">People adjust.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Were you the only refugee, or were you the only refugee from Germany among these children that went to the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I -- I was the only -- only refugee, the only one who couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s327">But this family, this Mrs. Palmer, she had a four year old child -- or a three year old child, was so kind and was so nice.</span> <span id="s328">I have since found out that I really lucked out, that some of these children were mistreated and -- and -- and were not happy.</span> <span id="s329">And she would bring me up tea in -- in -- in the morning and treated me totally as a member of the family.</span> <span id="s330">And what the people got was, they got the ration book from the children that they took in, and they got like a pittance of money from the British government.</span> <span id="s331">They did this out of their generosity.</span> <span id="s332">And even when Rosh Hashanah came, my parents came to visit me.</span> <span id="s333">How they found their way out there, again, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s334">And I remember mixing up Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, I thought you had to fast on -- on -- on -- on Rosh Hashanah, I mixed it up completely.</span> <span id="s335">Not that as a child I had to fast, but they -- when my parents came, they had them for dinner with -- with the Sunday roast and like that.</span> <span id="s336">They were very kind people and I learned to speak English with total immersion.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: How long did you stay with the Palmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Til about the 14th of December.</span> <span id="s339">So it was September through Dece -- you know, about three and a half months.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: And why did you leave them?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Because our number came up to come to America and we went to Southampton and got on the SS Volendam and -- which was the last ship to cross the ocean before United States went to war then, in 19 -- what, ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: When you left England, you and your parents, what were you able to bring with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: We were able to bring one trunk, it’s a great, big steamer trunk, that’s what they took to England with them, and they had about 20 or 30 dollars by the time we arrived in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: What happened to all the things that you shipped to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: The Germans -- the -- the government -- German government when they invaded Holland robbed all those warehouse and emptied out all those lift vans and took ev -- took everything.</span> <span id="s346">That’s what happened to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Are there any -- any memories or thoughts about England that we haven’t discussed that you’d like to share before I have you leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I -- I think that the most impressive thing that -- that I have emotionally is a heritage of a tremendous love of the United States of America, which I learned from my parents and the gratefulness of being here and that this truly is a land of salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: But when you reflect back on your time in England, is there anything that you haven’t mentioned that you -- you want to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: There was -- while I was there -- no, I -- I -- I was happy in the country.</span> <span id="s351">You know, I was -- we picked berries and I had friends and I was all right.</span> <span id="s352">I mean, I -- my parents wrote to me, you know, what -- I think -- I think I was a very, in those days, a very secure child.</span> <span id="s353">That changed later in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: What were your expectations of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: This -- I don’t mean this with any sense of -- of -- of prejudice, it’s just a child, but I remember it -- my storybooks in -- in Germany were that blacks were in Africa and wore grass skirts.</span> <span id="s356">And I remember the first time I saw -- well, now we say African American -- black on the street, I like got hysterical and was saying, why aren’t they wearing -- to my mother -- why aren’t they wearing long grass skirts?</span> <span id="s357">Who are these people?</span> <span id="s358">And I think my expectations were that I wouldn’t be separated from my parents any more and that I would be with them, and that I knew that they would have to work very, very hard and I was told I would have to do my share, which I did insofar as that I always -- I always worked very hard, but without resentment, just like they did, to make a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Where did you land when you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And what were your first impressions of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: The very, very, very tall buildings in New York City, and the noise.</span> <span id="s363">And we had had a -- a wonderful journey.</span> <span id="s364">It was over Christmas.</span> <span id="s365">It took about eight days to -- to cross.</span> <span id="s366">We had escort ships that -- against the submarines, I guess.</span> <span id="s367">And I remember Christmas on -- on -- on board the ship with m -- a beautiful Christmas tree in the middle of the dining room and -- and music and dancing and my poor mother was seasick the whol-whole journey.</span> <span id="s368">And I had a beautiful, black velvet dress with smocking that my grandmother had made for me and that was like the last glory days, you know, because my father kept saying, you better eat up, we better eat -- eat -- and -- and -- and -- and enjoy ourselves because it’s not going to be like this, you know, when we get to America.</span> <span id="s369">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Were there other Jewish refugees on the ship with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s372">There must have been.</span> <span id="s373">I have a -- a printout, a copy, a microfiche copy of the passengers on the ship, cause a friend of mine was doing li -- research and that she got -- she found.</span> <span id="s374">And there were quite a few -- I didn’t -- I don’t remember any of them, but I know from the list that they -- the ship was filled with refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Where did your family ri -- initially settle when they came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: New York, because my uncle ha -- had -- was there, my mother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: And what were your living conditions like when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Even worse than in London.</span> <span id="s379">We again lived in somebody’s apartment house i-in the Bronx, in somebody’s bedroom.</span> <span id="s380">And my father got a job in a meat packing plant carrying ice on his back and my mother scrubbed floors.</span> <span id="s381">And -- but that only lasted unt-until April.</span> <span id="s382">And my fa -- my father just couldn’t handle it any more, his back was breaking.</span> <span id="s383">And my mother had a first cousin in Washington D.C., and they -- by the name of Rosenfeld, and they -- the woman was her cousin, Regi and they got a job -- her husband’s name was Sigmund, he got a job for my father at the Hub Furniture company, setting up furniture in the warehouse.</span> <span id="s384">Furniture came knocked down -- cause he worked there, too.</span> <span id="s385">So that’s -- we went -- we went to Washington, D.C. and lived in their house on New York Avenue because they took in refugees.</span> <span id="s386">They had one of these big, old brownstones and -- and everybody worked and there was an old grandmother name of Bertha, she -- she did the cooking and we again lived in one room, and I, you know, was enrolled in elementary school in Washington.</span> <span id="s387">I’d been in school in New York, too, in elementary school.</span> <span id="s388">And there I was in a special class for refugee children, you know, for English.</span> <span id="s389">But by the time I got to wa -- by the time in April when I came to Washington, I was in a regular class.</span> <span id="s390">And my parents -- my mother got a job at the Toleman laundry sewing buttons on shirts [indecipherable] steam laundry, cause in those days buttons were still sewn on the laundried shirts, and my father worked there at the Hub, and they worked six days a week and this Regi had two sons.</span> <span id="s391">One was my age, one was older and I would go to school, you know, walk to school with them.</span> <span id="s392">And then they joined like a -- there was a club here, Verein, of German Jews in Washington, my parents met those people and I met other children and life started.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Did any relief organizations help your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: How were you received by Americans in general?</span> <span id="s396">Did they ask you about your experiences in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t remember -- I -- I know that I so desperately wanted only to be an American, that I tried very hard.</span> <span id="s399">And I think I must have had a British accent, they tell me I had a British accent at tha -- at that point, and I -- that’s what I wanted, you know, my parents, you know -- you know, I was -- I was a child.</span> <span id="s400">I was sent that first summer already to camp la -- Camp Louise, through the Strauss family, where the refugee children were sent for free.</span> <span id="s401">And they somehow found some shorts and some clothes for me and that was my first wonderful memory, was to be for three weeks at Camp Louise, which is the dearest thing to my heart.</span> <span id="s402">And both my daughters were counselors there and now my granddaughter is going to Camp Louise because of the generosity of what the S-Strauss family did for poor children.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Was it easy for you to make friends in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I’ve -- I’ve always had friends, I -- I -- no, I didn't find it difficult.</span> <span id="s405">I really had no feelings of -- of prejudice in the United States.</span> <span id="s406">I have -- I did not go through -- through any that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Was there anything that was a particularly difficult adjustment for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: I think the most difficult thing was that now they talk about latchkey children.</span> <span id="s409">My mother and father worked six days a week and I came home by myself after s -- after school, because within a year they had saved enough money t-to -- we moved to -- above a grocery store further up New York Avenue, Jewish family owned, it was one of those Mom and Pop stores and we lived in an apartment upstairs and of course we took in a roomer in the apartment.</span> <span id="s410">And I had to come home every single day by myself and I was 10 years old, you know, at that point.</span> <span id="s411">And that was hard.</span> <span id="s412">As -- and being an only child and again, I’ve always read it -- read a lot and I -- and I liked to draw and I liked to -- and I was not allowed to bring other children in, you know, because I was by my -- you know, by myself and so that’s what I remember from that life.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Were you able to keep in touch with your family in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s415">My -- my grandmother -- my grandmother -- the uncle was sent to the -- Theresienstadt and he died there.</span> <span id="s416">And my grandmother was sent to Auschwitz and was gassed.</span> <span id="s417">And there was no more news since after the war started, after u -- United States war started.</span> <span id="s418">And then after the war they got a telegram from the Red Cross, you know, that she had died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s419">And I have looked up the records at the Holocaust Museum and have the copies of the reports in -- from the books that the Germans kept of their demise.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: You were a student in this country during the war -- a good part of the war.</span> <span id="s421">Do you remember how the war was reported by the media, or discussed in schools?</span> <span id="s422">I mean, in what ways did the war touch your life as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I think the war touched me insofar as that I was always afraid that we’d get bombed in America.</span> <span id="s424">And I -- I was -- I was afraid.</span> <span id="s425">We’d have blackouts, you know and there were wardens, you know, and I -- I think I have -- I wa -- just plain afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Do you remember when Germany attacked the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s428">Well, I remember that -- that in the beginning the Germans and the Soviets were -- were allies, and then -- and then, of course, then the Russians became our allies.</span> <span id="s429">I mean, you know, but I remember, you know, that -- that bit of history.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: When you think back about your first year in the United States, what comes to your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Trying to adapt to school.</span> <span id="s432">Trying to adapt to learning.</span> <span id="s433">Trying to adapt to -- to -- told not to complain because that -- that grandmother who ran the house there, really gave us very, very, very poor food.</span> <span id="s434">And wanting clothing like the other children and not having it.</span> <span id="s435">And also nice times.</span> <span id="s436">I was -- I was given 10 cents to go to the movies on Saturday, and those were the days where there was like the double features and the cartoons and the news.</span> <span id="s437">You know, adjusting to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: I’m going to pause so we can change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: -- ocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Brigitte Freidin.</span> <span id="s442">This is tape two, side A and I -- I wanted to have you reflect back on -- on the year 1941, before the United States got involved in the war.</span> <span id="s443">Is there anything that stands out in your mind about -- about that year?</span> <span id="s444">W-Were you concerned -- overly concerned about what was going on in Europe or did you kind of take it in stride?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I think I was 11 years old and I was a ch -- again, I was living a child’s life and it was -- and we were moving t-to -- for the first time in what, two years, two and a half years, where we had an apartment of our own, even though I still had to sleep with my parents because the other bedroom was with a roomer, a -- where we had a roomer.</span> <span id="s446">But I remember the rash -- ration book -- books, and I remember the blackouts and you had to pull your window shades down, you know, window shades.</span> <span id="s447">And I remember the headlines and the fears that -- that people had, and that’s about all that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Do you remember what you were doing when news came out about Pearl Harbor being attacked?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: I remember very little except now it’s war, now it’s real.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: In what ways did your life change when America went to war?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Where we -- I think it was the ra -- the -- the -- the rationing -- the rationing and we had a radio where we didn’t have -- well, nobody had televisions, there was -- there was no television.</span> <span id="s452">And I think it was the constant -- the constant talk, and -- and the fear and -- and the fear of that bombs might be coming, but I think that also I -- I -- I -- I -- I think that because the conversation was about my grandmother, my uncle and the cousins and all the other relatives in -- in Germany, and what was happening and there was a newspaper called “The Aufbau.”</span> <span id="s453">I don’t know if it’s still in existence.</span> <span id="s454">It’s -- means the rebuilding.</span> <span id="s455">But people got the news, and that was really where -- where the news came about what was happening in Germany, and everybody subscribed to it.</span> <span id="s456">It was printed in New York.</span> <span id="s457">And -- and there was a-always the worry.</span> <span id="s458">That’s what I remember was tenseness and worry.</span> <span id="s459">And that it was wartime and -- and listening to the news every night.</span> <span id="s460">And I think that that’s what most people remember about that time.</span> <span id="s461">Because I had no brothers and sisters and knew no one who was a -- well, there was terrible worry because my mother’s -- had a sister by that time, whose husband -- his name was Jacob -- Jakob who died in the prison in Augsburg from a heart attack.</span> <span id="s462">He never even got to the camps, he -- and she came via Spain eventually, to America.</span> <span id="s463">And my mother and father introduced her to a widower who she then married, and lived in -- also in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s464">And her son had been part of the Kindertransport when he was 14, he went to England on the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s465">And Ken -- his name used to be Helmut, but they always change the names when you went in the army.</span> <span id="s466">Then he went to the tank corps with the Brits.</span> <span id="s467">And terrible worry about Ken -- you know, Helmut, what was happening to him.</span> <span id="s468">But that was my only big connection with somebody who would be in the service as -- as -- as a personal worry, you know, that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: The kinds of information you got from “The Aufbau,” and the kinds of information you got from the radio, was there much overlap?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: No, I -- I -- I think “The Aufbau” information was more what was happening in -- in -- in Germany and everywhere else, like with -- with the camps, and with -- with the -- with the carnage that was going -- going on, and probably about how the United States wasn’t doing anything.</span> <span id="s471">And from the newspapers I -- I really remember more when I was 14 -- well, fort -- a -- when I was 15 the war ended, like 13 and 14, I remember, you know, reading the news and -- and -- and when things looked bad being sad and -- and getting excited.</span> <span id="s472">You know, a child’s attitude is different than an adult’s.</span> <span id="s473">And again I think it made a difference, the stress level because we didn't have any relatives th-that were fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So when you reflect back on the years of 1942 and ’43 and ’44, what comes to your mind?</span> <span id="s475">What was happening in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Well, what was happening in my life, by -- by that time -- by the time I was 13 they had saved enough money that they bought a house with a thousand dollar deposit, for seven or eight thousand dollars on Dellafield Place in the upper northwest.</span> <span id="s477">And I was junior high school and I was in the ju -- JCC swim team and I was taking art lessons and I was -- I was a very busy -- very busy person.</span> <span id="s478">And, you know, I was going to school and I had -- and I had friends.</span> <span id="s479">And like all teenagers was very involved with myself.</span> <span id="s480">My parents were going to the Americanization school in 1944 because they got their citizenship in 1945, which was a tr -- and during that time -- I remember one time Mrs. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt was at the JCC and my mother, she must -- must have been the reception for German club, you know, the re-refugee club.</span> <span id="s481">And my mother wa -- came -- went there and she came home and she just couldn’t get over that the president’s wife, like the queen, should shake a commoner’s hand.</span> <span id="s482">And it was -- it -- only in America, only in America.</span> <span id="s483">But it was really such a glory and just a thankfulness to be in America.</span> <span id="s484">That was a constant refrain.</span> <span id="s485">And I would only talk English to my parents.</span> <span id="s486">I really was nasty.</span> <span id="s487">I -- I -- I wanted -- I wanted so much to be an American, and I didn’t even want to, like go out with the sons of -- of -- of -- of the other German Jews because I -- I was -- I was a f -- foolish kid in that way, where I -- but you know, there was -- my parents would talk German to me and I would only answer in English.</span> <span id="s488">And I really lost a great deal of the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: What was reaction of your family when -- when Roosevelt died?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: My mother and my father just cried and cried and cried.</span> <span id="s491">He was the hero, the great hero.</span> <span id="s492">And I don’t think that they knew how -- which now is in history, that he could have -- he could have saved millions and millions of people -- not millions, but he could have done something so that the carnage wouldn’t have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Do you remember reading about the thousand, or just less than a thousand Jews coming to Oswego for haven?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: How did you learn that the war was over in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Headlines in the newspapers, it was on the radio.</span> <span id="s497">It was yelled out on the street, it’s over.</span> <span id="s498">I remember go -- being -- going outside and yelling and screaming, it’s over, it’s over, it’s over.</span> <span id="s499">And then of course the hope that it would be over as far -- and then what -- shortly then, we bombed Japan.</span> <span id="s500">I forget how m -- it wasn’t that long a time and then that was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: What efforts did your family make to find relatives and friends in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: They -- they knew right after the war, and even during it that people that were the closest were all -- all were -- were killed.</span> <span id="s503">All were gassed, all were, insofar as family that -- that was left in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: You said that they knew during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Well, not -- not really, they guessed, they guessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: When did you begin to realize the full extent of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I think right -- I think when the telegrams came from the Red Cross that -- that the family was -- was gone, and of course in the newspapers, the American newspapers, when you started seeing the pictures of the camps and the liberation of the camps, that’s when the realities really struck.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: During this time that you were in the States, up through the war years, nobody asked you about your experiences in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did you feel justice was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I feel justice was done, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Did you follow the events in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: N-No, I really was not that concerned with Israel, with Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: In the years immediately after the war, what was happening in your life?</span> <span id="s519">So you’re now 15 years old and the war is over.</span> <span id="s520">In those first few post-war years, what was happening in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I was -- because we were poor, I was already working as a salesgirl in -- in -- in -- in a second rate department store, lower 7th Street.</span> <span id="s522">When I was 14, I ha -- I got a work permit so that I could have clothes, cause I wanted to be dressed like the other girls and the only way to get it was to work.</span> <span id="s523">And I was brought up that it was my job as much, to help with the family.</span> <span id="s524">In other words, I made the beds and started dinner for when my parents came home, because by that time my mother was working in small fur manufacturing company called Louies’ Furs, and she became the forelady fo-for making the linings for -- for the fur coats.</span> <span id="s525">And my father -- oh, my father had a -- with his friend they opened -- they bought a delicatessen on Sheridan Street, which lasted -- that was when I was 12 and 13 and my mother then went to work there.</span> <span id="s526">And that lasted about two and a half years, and she realized that I was being left alone, because it was a day and seven day a week proposition.</span> <span id="s527">And because my father -- my -- my father’s sense of values were not too good.</span> <span id="s528">He had trouble with --with what was right and what was wrong.</span> <span id="s529">He -- he actually, I think -- friend of ours who had met him and was a medical person said he’d become a -- like a psychopath.</span> <span id="s530">And this was -- this was -- a lot of it was due to his experiences at the camps in Dachau and -- and his [indecipherable] and losing everything.</span> <span id="s531">He never really adjusted.</span> <span id="s532">He didn’t learn English that well.</span> <span id="s533">My mother -- my mother learned English very well, could spell.</span> <span id="s534">I mean, she had an accent, but could read, write, spell, but he -- he never -- he never adjusted that well, as I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So you were in school and you were working.</span> <span id="s536">What about your social life?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: That’s when I -- the rejection started.</span> <span id="s538">That was when, because I went to a school called Roosevelt high school, where all the -- it was about 80 percent Jewish kids, 70 percent en -- and it was sororities, fraternities which were really outlawed.</span> <span id="s539">And I wanted to be part of, and I didn’t have the clothing, and I didn -- and I tried too hard, and that’s where I was the refugee.</span> <span id="s540">That’s where I was not treated right.</span> <span id="s541">Because I had the brains, but not the -- the -- the moxie.</span> <span id="s542">I didn’t -- I didn’t know how to be part of the American kids.</span> <span id="s543">I didn’t know, cause I was too European and too -- tried too hard.</span> <span id="s544">And that’s really -- from the Jewish kids is where the rejection came.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Did you and your family maintain any level of religious observance when you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s547">We -- my parents joined B’Nai Israel synagogue and -- which is a Conservative synagogue, and they did not -- she did not keep kosher any more, because she didn't have the money for two sets of dishes, or the kosher meat.</span> <span id="s548">And -- but it was never -- the cooking was always as if it was kosher, you know, no mixing.</span> <span id="s549">And all the holidays -- and we always had Friday night -- Friday night services, you know.</span> <span id="s550">And my mother -- my mother was really the religious one.</span> <span id="s551">There was -- she was always with the prayer book, she read -- they both read Hebrew fluently.</span> <span id="s552">And all the holidays were kept.</span> <span id="s553">And I think it was -- it -- it was -- I was brought up in -- in -- in a religious home where it was always as -- as -- as soon as the repatriation money comes from Germany, as soon as we get money, we’re going to buy dishes and we’re gonna -- we’re gonna go back to keeping kosher and then maybe she could stop working.</span> <span id="s554">And unfortunately, my mother died when I was 23 years old, of breast cancer.</span> <span id="s555">So, they had just gotten -- they hadn’t even gotten the monies yet, and I -- so she never got to -- to reap the benefit.</span> <span id="s556">But she felt God was punishing her, and made a promise to God that if she got well she would go back to being more religious.</span> <span id="s557">She -- she -- she was truly, truly a very deeply observant religious person.</span> <span id="s558">My father not as much, he -- I think he could have cared less.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: How much education -- how much formal education did you get in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I, of course, graduated high school.</span> <span id="s561">And then I had -- I went to college for three years and didn’t finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: You got married?</span> <span id="s563">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Can you tell me about your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: I met my husband when I was 16 and he was 17, and he is American born from a family that’s been -- came from Russia and Austria.</span> <span id="s566">Mother Austria fa -- in the middle 1800’s, so they’re real ipsy-pipsy Americans.</span> <span id="s567">And he was a consulting engineer, electrical engineer, and we got married when I was 21 and he was 22.</span> <span id="s568">And he went to school at night to finish his degree, and we both worked very, very hard and built up all -- also.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: And you mentioned children?</span> <span id="s570">A: I have two daughters.</span> <span id="s571">One is 45 and the other is 40, and they’re both -- they -- which I never -- I never realized it but they tell me that the Holocaust was always like over their heads, that I kept it -- that I talked about it.</span> <span id="s572">I’ve talked about the six million, and I’ve talked about their heritage as Jews and that we must never, never, never forget that they’re -- their Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: What did you do for your professional career as an adult?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I am a interior designer and I had my own business for 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Did you ever return to your hometown in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s577">I went back to -- my husband was a delegate to International Engineering Council in Denmark when I was what -- 19 -- 19 thir -- when I was 35, so, in 1965 -- ’64.</span> <span id="s578">And I went with him and he wanted to see where I was born and I didn't want to go but he insisted.</span> <span id="s579">So I went back to Augsburg then.</span> <span id="s580">And my father’s lawyer welcomed us and his wife took us sightseeing and I remembered everything, I remembered every single street.</span> <span id="s581">I remembered everything til we got to the house in the suburbs there, and there I got hysterical and broke up, and -- and -- and -- and I just couldn’t stay there.</span> <span id="s582">And we got out of Germany, fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: How were you treated by the Germans while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Well, the -- really, the only -- as a matter of fact, w-we were driving.</span> <span id="s585">We had come down the Romantic Road through Dinkelsbühl an-and -- and that whole Romantic Road.</span> <span id="s586">And it was a very rainy night and we were driving into Augsburg.</span> <span id="s587">This was beginning June, and we were lost.</span> <span id="s588">And there was a guy riding a bicycle next to the car and I asked him -- I wa -- I was looking for the [indecipherable] hotel.</span> <span id="s589">And he looked in the car, this is really weird -- I mean, I am now what, 34 - 35 years old, and he looked in the car and he said to me, he said, were you -- was your name Brigitte Mandle?</span> <span id="s590">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s591">And -- you know, in German.</span> <span id="s592">He said, I know you.</span> <span id="s593">I used to deliver the mattresses for your father.</span> <span id="s594">Follow me.</span> <span id="s595">And he took us to the hotel.</span> <span id="s596">So -- and my father’s lawyer, who had been working in the underground all those years and working fo-for -- for the Brits and became the first mayor of Augsburg and had saved the records of the Jewish people --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: You mean post-war mayor?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, post-war -- war mayor.</span> <span id="s599">He -- he and his wife treated us royally.</span> <span id="s600">And that’s really, you know, the only Germans, you know, that we met.</span> <span id="s601">We only stayed like two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Are you involved with any Holocaust related groups or organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No, I’m not.</span> <span id="s604">I’m just a volunteer at the museum, where I do translations from German into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: What special something do you bring to your work at the museum, that’s the result of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I think it’s what the museum has done for me.</span> <span id="s607">The museum has made me recognize the importance of the Holocaust, and that it can never happen again and that the world has to know.</span> <span id="s608">And I think I’m one of the greatest spokespeople for the museum, that everybody should see the museum.</span> <span id="s609">And the museum has made me realize the heritage that I have and how important it is for me to remember, and my children, and everyone else.</span> <span id="s610">It’s done more for me than I have ever done for the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Were there any special moments or experiences that you’ve had at the museum that you’d care to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: No, I --I -- I really just go and do my work, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Tell me a -- a little bit about your work.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh ma -- my work?</span> <span id="s615">I -- I think -- I think the biggest one was I did a series of translations of the letters during -- you mentioned the Nuremberg trials, of the inmates of -- of -- that they wrote home to their -- to their wives, to their mistresses, to their children, and how they never, ever, ever mention, not in one single letter, I’m so sorry, or I -- I sh -- I wish I could change things.</span> <span id="s616">They only wrote about -- now, I realize they must have been censored, these letters, but they wrote in the typical German letters, quoted from [indecipherable] and from Schiller and about life.</span> <span id="s617">Life is beautiful and I hope the flowers are blooming in springtime and I hope you have enough to eat, because their monies were taken away and their substances and their -- the families, and it was -- and how much I miss you and how much I love you and -- but no remorse and no -- nothing of the past, just worry about their families.</span> <span id="s618">And that impressed me, that I was -- that I was able to see these letters and -- and to translate them.</span> <span id="s619">And about the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s620">All the correspondence from the people, the telegrams and -- and -- and the letters that people have saved from what went on in that Saint Louis, and the -- and desperation of these people that -- I think that that’s the -- the most amazing thing that I am privileged enough to help in bringing this to the world, you know, into English.</span> <span id="s621">And ha -- I’ll add this, that I’m amazed that I’m able to do the translations, because I only had up to a third or fourth grade education in German.</span> <span id="s622">But it -- it -- now I can’t do -- I don’t do the technical things, they have other people that do the technical.</span> <span id="s623">But I am able to -- to really, really do this and it’s like -- it’s like a gift and -- and because of that I’m able to speak German again, even though I -- I speak no German with -- with this translation, but it seems to have gone from my head to my mouth.</span> <span id="s624">So this is, you know, an advantage, because it’s a language to know, like any language.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: The only public speaking I’ve done was I did a first person, in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: You mentioned grandchildren before.</span> <span id="s628">What have you told them about your -- your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: I’ve appeared in the first grade for both my granddaughters, the ones -- local ones, with -- like a -- I -- I happen to have -- that’s the only thing I have from Germany are two kiddush cups.</span> <span id="s630">So I took the kiddush cups to show that this is what life used to be, that we were able to bring things over and talked about having to escape.</span> <span id="s631">This is -- you know, an-and about being born in Germany, and about Hitler, keeping it mild, but you know, I talked with the teacher.</span> <span id="s632">But they don’t -- they -- they don’t really ask me that many questions.</span> <span id="s633">My grandchildren are -- are age three to 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So anything that we haven’t talked about that you’d like to add before we finish the interview?</span> <span id="s635">Anything that we haven’t covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: No, I think we’ve pretty well -- pretty well covered my life.</span> <span id="s637">I -- I find the older I ge -- I get, the more important I think it is, the reality of -- that the world cannot forget, and that I wish that people would just care more for each other and -- and love each other and all that, you know, sort of thing, and -- and not have prejudice, not have prejudice.</span> <span id="s638">Have no pecking orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: I’d like to thank you for doing the interview and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Brigitte Freidin.</span> <span id="s640">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">End of Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s643">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s644">PAGE
