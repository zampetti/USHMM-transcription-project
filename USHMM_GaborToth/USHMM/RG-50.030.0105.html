His name was Arthur.</span> <span id="s24">My parents name were Julius, Julius and Helena Weissman.</span> <span id="s25">Uh we lived in in in an old large home on outside of town with a hugh garden with many fruit trees and flowers, a wonderful thing for children to roam in.</span> <span id="s26">I had ten cats, all black.</span> <span id="s27">I knew all their names and uh now, you know, my children know, my grandchildren are used to me to recite the names of my cats.</span> <span id="s28">My brother had two dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Uh I used to love swimming in summer and skiing in winter and uh by and large I I had a marvelous childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Uh I went to public school first and then but only until the war broke out to Catholic school called Notre Dame.</span> <span id="s32">It was a private girls school.</span> <span id="s33">However we had the rabbi coming giving us Jewish instructions, so it was about uh I would say a quarter of of the girls in school, in my class, were Jewish.</span> <span id="s34">And that was the natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s35">I uh I really liked school very much even though I pretended I didn't.</span> <span id="s36">Uh and of course, you know, when the war came that was the end of my formal education.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Tell us what happened when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Well, I guess the danger signals were flying very high in uh in the summer of 1939.</span> <span id="s39">Uh by and large I must say it was ignored by my family.</span> <span id="s40">Uh I was away with my mother in a place called Krinitza (ph).</span> <span id="s41">Uh I even remember my my very first uh incident which inspired a great deal of fear.</span> <span id="s42">My mother and I went to a concert and I remember the setting quite vividly.</span> <span id="s43">Uh there were flowers around.</span> <span id="s44">I'm not very musical but uh that summer something caught on that day and I remember uh the crowd of people sitting there and and flowers and it was very warm, uh a day of...you know, one of the golden days of of summer, as I see it now, and suddenly a young man came running up to the podium and he pushed the conductor aside and he said, how can you all sit here listening to music when danger is coming from there, and he pointed to to the which separated us from Czechoslovakia which already had been occupied by the Nazis and and he said monsters are coming from there.</span> <span id="s45">Why don't you go home and take up arms and join...I remember moving closer to my mother and and saying shouldn't we go home and uh but pretty soon police came and uh arrested the man because he was an agitator for disturbing the peace.</span> <span id="s46">I I I still remember that that sudden fear.</span> <span id="s47">That that really was my my first memory of uh of something impending but we stayed perhaps another week.</span> <span id="s48">I don't remember exactly how long.</span> <span id="s49">However, on our way home we saw at stations an awful lot of baggage which was labeled Warsaw.</span> <span id="s50">Apparently people were going to Warsaw and when we came home uh my father had his arm in a sling and my mother naturally was terribly concerned and uh apparently he had suffered a slight heart attack and uh unfortunately and since things were moving very fast, uh that must have been perhaps the third week in August...that we received a telegram from my uncle in Turkey.</span> <span id="s51">My mother had a brother...my mother only had one brother and he lived in Turkey and uh he sent us a telegram saying that we should get out, that we had visas which were in the Embassy in Warsaw, but my mother said uh we're not going to tell Poppa about the telegram.</span> <span id="s52">Poppa is ill (ph) and he should not be disturbed.</span> <span id="s53">And I guess that my family, and I only hope and pray that my mother really didn't fully realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Tell us just what happened next.</span> <span id="s55">What did you do once you realized...</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Well, uh it was Friday morning.</span> <span id="s57">I I I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s58">I was fifteen you see.</span> <span id="s59">It was Friday morning when we heard a lot of planes and people ran into the streets and uh and there were German planes and we ran out and saw planes with the swastika flying over.</span> <span id="s60">It was terribly exciting and and a lot of activities started then.</span> <span id="s61">They were building trenches and uh and you know, uh my mother tried to keep sort of the windows down, were closed so from my father's bedroom...my father was in bed.</span> <span id="s62">My father was quite ill and that night uh there were lots of of refugees on the streets.</span> <span id="s63">You know, people running away and and there was was shooting.</span> <span id="s64">I remember one one man was carrying a goat on his back.</span> <span id="s65">Apparently it was his only possession, a small goat and people with wheelbarrows and carts and everything and my brother had a girlfriend and apparently her uh family called and said that they are going to flee into the interior of Poland and suggested that they would take my brother and me along and my father insisted that should be my brother's decision.</span> <span id="s66">I was, you know, considered too young to make a decision.</span> <span id="s67">My brother was nineteen at the time and my brother said no, we we're not going to go.</span> <span id="s68">We will stay together.</span> <span id="s69">You you'll need us.</span> <span id="s70">My father was ill, and and that was a terrible shock because, you know, my father to me was sort of the center of my universe.</span> <span id="s71">I mean, you know, when Poppa decreed something, he would do anything and that he should suddenly ask us, particularly my brother, to make a decision...such a momentous decision.</span> <span id="s72">I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when it ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he wanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I should call the family to see what everyone is doing, my father's brothers and there were uncles and aunts and so on, and I went downstairs and uh the ring of the telephone...there was no answer.</span> <span id="s73">No one answered anywhere and uh you know, I remember suddenly it was like like you were left in a world of the dead, you know, all those homes that I remembered and the phones were ringing and ringing and there was no answer whatsoever and uh when I came up my father said no one answers today, and I said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">And it was a wonderful Saturday.</span> <span id="s75">Everything was cut off.</span> <span id="s76">There was...we had no electricity, no light and it was a beautiful, calm September day, flowers outside and my parents were sort of joking.</span> <span id="s77">My father got dressed and came downstairs and we were all sitting together and it was really the the last beautiful day.</span> <span id="s78">And then in the evening they start with some shelling and my brother went out to let his dog in and when he came back he he had a hole in his trousers and he said they were shooting from the rooftops.</span> <span id="s79">The Germans were coming but we went to the basement with some other people, you know, and it was morning.</span> <span id="s80">Then I I don't remember those hours too well, but what I remember most vividly is uh that my mother called, said we should come.</span> <span id="s81">She had prepared some breakfast and we came upstairs and we sat down.</span> <span id="s82">Suddenly, this tremendous roar, the roar of motorcycles and it was the motorcycle with Nazis in it, two...one in the side car and on sitting up there, and my brother had just, he had a wristwatch, but he had just taken it out of his pocket because he carried it in his pocket, and I saw his, you know, his hand was down and it was 9:10 in the morning.</span> <span id="s83">And I remember everybody just sat there totally stunned and then we heard people uh running.</span> <span id="s84">There were more more cars and more motorcycles were coming and and people were shouting, heil Hitler, and we saw from from the house across the street the black swastika flag and I think that was the most enormous shock, that people were prepared, was our neighbors, you know, our friends, and they knew it in the very first hour and uh to me, and of course, you know, you can only see it in in retrospect and of course I lived it many times, but one of the things uh it sort of changed suddenly.</span> <span id="s85">I remember uh the coal fell out from the cradle of the fireplace and uh it went on the carpet and the carpet was sort of smoldering and and no one paid any attention to it and I remember it had once happened before...how upset my mother was and no one paid any attention.</span> <span id="s86">These were just tiny little vignettes which suddenly sort of you know changed everything.</span> <span id="s87">And uh shortly thereafter perhaps...you know, then more and more trucks of soldiers were coming and and the voices grew more hoarse, people shouting heil Hitler and I I saw a childhood friend of mine carrying white roses to to the soldiers and somebody was giving the soldiers schnapps and flowers for and the whole sort of thing and I I remember starting to cry and my brother dragged me on the carpet and he said, keep quiet, you know, you you can't do that, and he took me up to bed and he said, you know, don't make a sound and it was in the after...it was in the morning...I mean, you know, uh the whole day was sort of uh melange (ph) of many many feelings which I try to remember over the years, but one of of the worst things happened that afternoon.</span> <span id="s88">Uh the mother of the childhood friend of mine...she blessedly is alive and she lives in Israel...her name is Esther Bergman (ph).</span> <span id="s89">Her mother came and she asked where my father was and she said uh...but she knew that he was ill but she said,also to my brother that no man should go on the streets because they had rounded up all the men that they could find and they locked them in the temple and they set the temple aflame and then she sort of went out by the back door.</span> <span id="s90">And I think that was truly the first impact what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: What happened over the next few days?</span> <span id="s92">How did uh things ?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I couldn't you tell you day by day, you know.</span> <span id="s94">Uh people came.</span> <span id="s95">Our our neighbors came, our non-Jewish neighbors came...oh, one thing, yes...uh a neighbor who, you know...she...the home in which we lived in not only was I and my brother born there but my mother had been born there.</span> <span id="s96">It was a family home, you know, and our grandmother had lived with us.</span> <span id="s97">Fortunately, blessedly for her, she died the year before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s98">She, you know, never faced that.</span> <span id="s99">Uh a woman came and she asked where our flag was, the Polish flag, you know, which used to be red and white, and uh my mother said why, and she said we have to make a German flag out of it and my mother pretended to look for it in all places where she knew she wouldn't find it, you know, and then uh the woman left and she said she would be back later.</span> <span id="s100">Maybe my father can help look for it, and I think that became very clear that we better produce it because she really wanted it for our protection and she said all you have to do is, you know, keep the the red flag and cut a round circle from the white, put a black swastika on it and she came to collect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">She did it and then she said she wanted to look where Arthur was because he is very strong.</span> <span id="s102">He should hang it up and he apparently could not be found to do it, so the woman struggled to hang the flag up and she sort of said to my mother, you know, if uh if the flag is not displayed from here, it would be pretty obvious who you are.</span> <span id="s103">And uh I remember we couldn't look out of the window to see to see that flying.</span> <span id="s104">We had some other people you know living in in our home as well who uh who were not Jewish and some were sympathizers and of course they wanted that, because you know, this was the part which was German speaking.</span> <span id="s105">Bielitz before the war was Austria and later on it was also one of the first things that became uh it was they called it , you know, , uh where so we were unfortunately not too far from from Auschwitz, which was , and that became the perfect which was allegedly self-ruled.</span> <span id="s106">Of course it wasn't, you know, but we immediately became uh under the symbols as as Germany.</span> <span id="s107">So uh the people who...I suppose most people were German-speaking people, you see, and people were shouting uh heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s108">Thank you for the liberation, and things like that because they thought that you're not an Austrian Empire was coming back with, you know, Franz Joseph and the beautiful Empress Elizabeth and so on, you know, was the part had been under Poland for only twenty years, so uh uh I think there was a lot of mis...perhaps misguided feeling on behalf of the people, maybe not so much pro-Nazi at that particular point, but of course all that changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Over the next few months, what happened to you and your family and how did things</span></p> <p><span id="s110">change?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: What I can unfortunately tell you...uh fairly soon an order came that all young men between I think sixteen and fifty had to register.</span> <span id="s112">My father at that point was about fifty and since he was ill he did not have to register for a transport.</span> <span id="s113">My brother was nineteen and, of course, everyday you know, that we knew that England and France declared war, you know, that we knew right away.</span> <span id="s114">That happened Sunday.</span> <span id="s115">You know, we were occupied Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s116">Sunday afternoon uh England and and France declared war on Germany.</span> <span id="s117">Uh then you know, most of the family had fled, our family; however, my father's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the trains which which were bombed, came back with her son David and she found her apartment occupied by uh by other people, and she came to stay with us.</span> <span id="s118">David was about my brother's age, and David and also my brother went to register to whatever they were going to do and they said that they they would be in uh in some sort of labor battalion to uh build up what was uh destroyed by the war.</span> <span id="s119">The date was the 19th of October on which my brother left.</span> <span id="s120">Anyway...I tell you one thing...my my mother refused to make his bed for for months.</span> <span id="s121">She wanted to keep the imprint of his head on the pillow.</span> <span id="s122">(Pause) All things got worse from day to day, you know.</span> <span id="s123">We didn't hear from my brother for a long, long long time and when we finally did, which I believe was months later, he was uh blessedly in the Russian occupied zone.</span> <span id="s124">He was in .</span> <span id="s125">And what apparently happened was that uh they were brought into the interior of Poland uh near the I don't know exactly what location...pursued by bullets.</span> <span id="s126">Those who were good swimmers swam across.</span> <span id="s127">He was a very good swimmer and he was in in , which was uh occupied by the Russians and he worked there.</span> <span id="s128">Uh my brother was was trained in chemistry uh and he worked in some sort of a factory making germ (ph) or whatever.</span> <span id="s129">Uh that was one of the greatest, marvelous moments in the bleakness of our existence to to hear that Arthur was alive.</span> <span id="s130">Uh I cannot...I really...I mean I was sort of refreshing my memory and looking at some of the things which I had written after the war which I have the most clear knowledge as far as dates are concerned but I know that uh it probably was a few months later that we were to move into the basement of our home.</span> <span id="s131">It was very wet there and there was no electricity there and uh my father's uh condition deteriorated quite a bit.</span> <span id="s132">He suddenly looked very old.</span> <span id="s133">Uh my mother uh who up to that point you see, because my grand...we had lived with my grandmother and so I was rather pampered and you know, uh given to be very easily discouraged and upset about uh little things like uh you know, table clothes didn't iron properly, or the lace was wrong or something...uh showed incredible strength and fortitude.</span> <span id="s134">As a matter of fact she was the one who did not cry when my brother left.</span> <span id="s135">And my father wept.</span> <span id="s136">The first time I saw my father crying.</span> <span id="s137">It was sort of reversal of of roles you see and I think to to me a very devastating thing to see my father helpless and and I never saw my father helpless before and uh so we lived in the basement.</span> <span id="s138">Uh I learned new skills.</span> <span id="s139">I saw my mother uh bringing an old...it was called petroleum lampiere (ph), you know...uh lamp....I learned to clean the chimney of the lamp and if we got some guests to to make illumination like that, because we had no light.</span> <span id="s140">Uh pretty soon of course, you know, uh we exhausted our funds because we we had no no money.</span> <span id="s141">You know, everything was frozen.</span> <span id="s142">My father didn't earn anything and all those things were very hard to come by but where we lived, you know, there there were vegetables and things were obtainable and our our neighbors...I had a , you know, a nanny, who was wonderful to us and she lived diagonally across the street and she would go and get vegetables and bring things to us but uh my mother was always a wonderful needlewoman.</span> <span id="s143">She could do wonderful things with her hands, so we sort of through that we would be knitting and I learned to...I learned to knit before the war but I wasn't particularly interested in that, you know.</span> <span id="s144">I was more of a tomboy running around with cats and climbing trees and and I settled down and we would start knitting sweaters for people.</span> <span id="s145">My mother really had a wonderful reputation.</span> <span id="s146">You know, she would embroider things on sweaters.</span> <span id="s147">She did some marvelous things and uh we would be able to get candles.</span> <span id="s148">We had quite a store of candles because uh we couldn't use the lamp too often because petroleum was available, you know, on only limited things and our ration card...we got ration card, you know, with the name Jew and and there was very little to eat and uh so uh my mother and I would would knit for as long as daylight would allow and my father would sit and read to us.</span> <span id="s149">And really this is how uh my father was wonderful.</span> <span id="s150">.</span> <span id="s151">you see, I went to Polish schools.</span> <span id="s152">Even so, my first language was German...spoke German at home and when I would come home from school I would switch to German, but I couldn't read or write German, you know.</span> <span id="s153">I spoke it naturally.</span> <span id="s154">It was my first language.</span> <span id="s155">So my father unearthed my mother's books and he started teaching me to read and write German, and then my father would read to us, you know, and and we would let the candle go down.</span> <span id="s156">Then we would take take some wax and my mother made uh little wicks and we would put the candle on again and we would uh we would knit.</span> <span id="s157">We got...I remember it very clearly...for knitting a sweater, uh intricate sweater.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">You know, at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the intricate work.</span> <span id="s159">We would get uh thirty .</span> <span id="s160">Well, it was thirty if you could buy food on ration it was fine, but we had to start buying food on the black market, so I would say uh roughly a loaf of bread would cost thirty marks so for knitting a sweater we would able to buy roughly a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s161">And this is how things went.</span> <span id="s162">And then started the things of the , you know.</span> <span id="s163">It was uh to be sent away and every so often a little cart would come announcing that...as a matter of fact the first one came uh when we had not heard from Arthur, and I remember at that point my my mother sort of must have suffered a nervous breakdown, at least a momentary lapse because I remember she was she was totally out of things.</span> <span id="s164">She was calling for Arthur.</span> <span id="s165">She was in bed.</span> <span id="s166">And my father was up with her and my father told me to go and to pack.</span> <span id="s167">We we were supposed to leave with twenty pounds of our belongings.</span> <span id="s168">And uh my father bought for us sort of little suitcases and he told me to to pack some things and and word got around to uh in the community that we were selling things.</span> <span id="s169">Everybody...I mean all the Jews.</span> <span id="s170">.</span> <span id="s171">that was the way to do it, and people started to come.</span> <span id="s172">My father said whatever anybody gives you, take it, and he stayed with my mother, and then uh word got around that if...I don't remember the exact amount...let's say uh kilo gold...something like that...it might have been less, it might been more.</span> <span id="s173">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s174">If that would be given and then that would stay , so you know, everybody scurried to get whatever jewelry people had to bring it...of course that was another...was what the Germans did in order to to get the valuables which people were holding and .</span> <span id="s175">And apparently they got what uh whatever was needed for for that purpose because uh then a note came to say we could stay.</span> <span id="s176">You know, , and that would happen roughly every six, seven months, and again I I don't know exactly that, but uh but is after we got, you know, my mother seemed to bounce back and became her her strong self and and from that time on I would say until the very end, my mother was absolutely a tower of strength.</span> <span id="s177">You know, looking back now, my mother was a very young woman at that time.</span> <span id="s178">She was she was forty-one when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s179">Of course to me she was an old woman, you know, to a fifteen year old girl, you know.</span> <span id="s180">My father was ten years older than my mother.</span> <span id="s181">So the existence, you know, and worse and this is how we survived.</span> <span id="s182">This was three years...1939 through the spring of 1942.</span> <span id="s183">The very very spring...it could have been March perhaps when the order came that we had to move to the Jewish ghetto which was the shabby, remote part of our town, quite far away from where we had lived, because it was actually in you see.</span> <span id="s184">Uh Bielitz- it's called now, two , twin cities and that we lived in Bielitz and that was and way out , near a very old cemetery where we had to to move.</span> <span id="s185">And uh as I told you, my my garden hold held most of my wonderful childhood memories and uh fairly soon...I would say probably in early 1940, uh there was a sign on it that no Jews or dogs were permitted in the garden, so we naturally did not go but on the morning on which we were forced to leave our home, I jumped over the fence and went to the garden and I ran around.</span> <span id="s186">Uh I remember there were the first violets where we had a little brook... , the first violets were there, which I had picked and I remember sort of planting a branch of a tree where I used to sit and pretending what it would be like if if nothing had happened you know and I would go in and my parents would be at breakfast and my brother would be going to school, and so on, and uh you know, even so uh I always firmly believed that I'll go back home.</span> <span id="s187">That became the crutch through all the years.</span> <span id="s188">Looking back now I realize that I must have had a premonition because I remember in that I sort of really started imagining what my garden would look in all seasons, and I knew that I would not see it.</span> <span id="s189">But I don't know any longer if I thought that I'll never see it for a period of time or if there would be finality in it.</span> <span id="s190">I I really don't know.</span> <span id="s191">But, you know, you sort of take memories out like uh like cameos and hold them and look at them.</span> <span id="s192">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Tell us about going into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Well, strange as it may seem, I guess I really was happier in the ghetto than at home because I had friends there, you know.</span> <span id="s195">At home I was uh...well, that isn't quite true.</span> <span id="s196">My my father, you know, there were several girls, particularly the one who became tremendously close to me, my friend Elsa (ph).</span> <span id="s197">There was Esther Bergman who lived not too far away and she used to come, but my father would teach us and that was still at home.</span> <span id="s198">You know, he would take books out and teach us a bit of history and all those things that he knew.</span> <span id="s199">He was very knowledgeable so, you know, in a very fragmented way, but I think uh in those first three years, almost three years at home, it was my father...I I think I I acquired quite a bit of knowledge.</span> <span id="s200">He taught me all...my father my father was supposed to be a rabbi and because you know he came from...you see my mother was born in Beilitz which was uh very Austrian and they prided themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s201">My...as a matter of fact my my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, uh still celebrated Kaiser Franz Joseph, that's the Austrian Kaiser, uh birthday which is on the 18th of August which I still remember, you know and because uh and I think they all talked about the good old days, you know, the wars and you know, everybody has to think the good old days, but my father's family uh came from a place called and was the seat of the which was he was very well know.</span> <span id="s202">As a matter of fact even now I read quite a bit...his name was Freidman (ph) and my father's family was related to him and I have some wonderful childhood memories as a child going to .</span> <span id="s203">Uh should I have continued with with what I talked before...do you wish me to...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Let's let's...yeah...let's do this.</span> <span id="s205">Break it and then come...you're going into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">You started talking about....</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s208">But uh I don't remember why I wanted to to tell this particular story.</span> <span id="s209">In any event, uh my friends, you know, there was a number of girls and they...we all lived in proximity, you know.</span> <span id="s210">In the ghetto there was one large building and a number of my friends lived there, so it uh it really was in a way a bit nicer for me where, you know, because there was a very uh sharp cur...curfew that I could never see my friends like in the evenings or after five o'clock or what have you.</span> <span id="s211">Living in the same building was sort of...it was nice to see my friends, you know.</span> <span id="s212">And there was also some babies there, and I liked babies and I could go and play with the two babies, so for me in a way it was a bit easier.</span> <span id="s213">It wasn't for very long.</span> <span id="s214">As a matter of fact, looking back I realize how little time there was because uh very soon an order came that we had to go and work in uh in a shop, sort of factory thing sewing garments in a place called .</span> <span id="s215">Uh so my mother and I had to go .</span> <span id="s216">We went under guard to to a train.</span> <span id="s217">The train station was not too far away and uh we worked sewing garments there and and then my father had to go to fortify the river in Suka (ph) and that was very hard because my father could really not bend his his arm very well but he said...but he started looking a little better.</span> <span id="s218">You see that he was very pale because being home uh for so long so actively being out in the fresh air...it was deceiving but seemed to me that Poppa looked better.</span> <span id="s219">It was a very short time, really.</span> <span id="s220">Uh come to think of it, it probably was not more than than two months.</span> <span id="s221">And then I remember my uh in May eighteenth birthday.</span> <span id="s222">I was fifteen when the war broke out and I was three years...my eighteenth birthday.</span> <span id="s223">My mother decided that I'm going to have a party and uh I just had a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s224">I just had a big birthday, my sixty-fifth, and a friend of mine who now lives in Detroit met my uh children give me a party.</span> <span id="s225">She came to the party and she was in in Arizona now, and she was at that birthday party.</span> <span id="s226">The birthday party was rather grand because my mother had some oatmeal and she had made some wonderful cookies which we all swarmed.</span> <span id="s227">They were absolutely like uh tasted like uh nuts and I had a birthday party, which was crowned by an incredible thing.</span> <span id="s228">I got an orange.</span> <span id="s229">I always loved oranges.</span> <span id="s230">Only later did I find out that my mother had gone out of the ghetto, sold a diamond and pearl ring to get me an orange.</span> <span id="s231">That was the last birthday gift from my parents.</span> <span id="s232">(Pause) Uh a couple of my friends were there.</span> <span id="s233">One lives in New York and uh she reminded me of something not too terribly long ago because uh the orders came on the 28th of June...all the men had had to leave on a Sunday...my father amongst them.</span> <span id="s234">(Pause) We went to the station.</span> <span id="s235">My father stood in the...it was just dreadful.</span> <span id="s236">He wore the yellow star.</span> <span id="s237">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s238">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s240">You had just finished.</span> <span id="s241">We're back on camera, and you had just finished telling me about the orange your mother gave you for your eighteenth...</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Right.</span> <span id="s243">And then the order that my father's leaving.</span> <span id="s244">There is however one thing that I would like to mention as a tribute to my parents.</span> <span id="s245">Uh the last night before my father left...of course we all lived in one large room at that point...I heard my parents talking.</span> <span id="s246">I don't know if it was for them or for my benefit.</span> <span id="s247">They did not mention at all the parting in the morning, but they spoke about their years together.</span> <span id="s248">They were, you know, about about the happiness they had shared, about uh my brother's birth and mine, about the hopes they had for us, and I think in in death they have instilled something in me which which has been my legacy all this...uh the value of of the love, of the commitment, of the of the family, and uh you know, when the going goes rough as it was in in subsequent times, it uh it was a very comforting thing and I shall always be grateful for that.</span> <span id="s249">I mentioned seeing my father for the last time and after that, my friend who lives in New York now, uh and I went...we knew...see, they were taking all the men on Sunday and uh took place on Monday morning.</span> <span id="s250">Uh we decided, uh and I, that we should, we we knew what's going to happen to to all the books, probably prayer books and most of the books which were in Jewish families that were treasured and uh after my father was taken away, we went and collected all the books.</span> <span id="s251">I was afraid that the Germans are going to use it for unspeakable purposes and we dragged it to the Jewish cemetery which was really the ghetto, and uh we buried them there.</span> <span id="s252">And I'm sorry for not understanding my mother's grief completely at that time.</span> <span id="s253">You know, I was really terribly close to my father and that I didn't comfort my mother.</span> <span id="s254">Today I think I sort of needed to be alone, to lick my own wounds, so to speak.</span> <span id="s255">Uh there's just one more thing that I want to mention.</span> <span id="s256">Before my father left, he asked me (pause)...</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: It's OK.</span> <span id="s258">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: And my father said that uh...I'll always remember that one does not carry one's calling card in one's pocket, engraved upon one's ...(Pause) (Crying) (Pause)...anyway I'm sure that many people have given you descriptions of of the leaving one uh of leaving and I guess our's was not too much different.</span> <span id="s260">Except that my mother decided to fast on that day.</span> <span id="s261">It was a Monday, and my mother fasted every Monday since my brother had left, and uh she had a bit of precious cocoa she had hoarded throughout the entire war for a special celebration and she made some cocoa for me that morning.</span> <span id="s262">I must say it did not taste very sweet.</span> <span id="s263">We were marched through the town under the whips of the SS uh to a certain collection...I had it happen to me many times during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Later on that one sees sort of in rapid succession the things which you see as a thing which is a hoax (ph), like uh they were putting a new name of a movie on the marquee, uh watching by a shop which sold fabrics and uh remembering the type of fabric that my mother bought for a summer dress, but it wasn't colorfast.</span> <span id="s265">You know, it was such a..</span> <span id="s266">.</span> <span id="s267">and yet it's very funny.</span> <span id="s268">I remember it in .</span> <span id="s269">I remember them now you know.</span> <span id="s270">Uh seeing some neighbor peering from behind the curtain, because you see we went in from from the ghetto, through through the town again to the other side of the town to which was called the where we went.</span> <span id="s271">Uh I marched with my mother.</span> <span id="s272">I saw a man with a cane.</span> <span id="s273">He asked me how old I was.</span> <span id="s274">I said eighteen.</span> <span id="s275">He told me to go to the left.</span> <span id="s276">We were loaded on trucks sometime later and I would like to get this over with as fast as I can, OK?</span> <span id="s277">And I heard my mother's voice...I did.</span> <span id="s278">And she was calling be strong, .</span> <span id="s279">And I heard that.</span> <span id="s280">I was in the truck.</span> <span id="s281">I jumped off and I said I want to go to my mother.</span> <span id="s282">The little man in a raincoat came by.</span> <span id="s283">His name was .</span> <span id="s284">He was from .</span> <span id="s285">I don't know how he had this enormous strength.</span> <span id="s286">He was quite short.</span> <span id="s287">it was raining.</span> <span id="s288">He was wearing a raincoat and a hat.</span> <span id="s289">And he took me bodily and he threw me back on the truck and he said you are too young to die.</span> <span id="s290">So it was the man who probably sent my mother to her death decided I should not run back to her.</span> <span id="s291">We went to a place called .</span> <span id="s292">There was a lager.</span> <span id="s293">It was transient camp and there was the 29th of June, 1942, a Monday.</span> <span id="s294">A long story .</span> <span id="s295">I'll just confine it to my own....I had the opportunity of leaving there, cause of , you know, a boy who liked me.</span> <span id="s296">His parents tried to get me out of the .</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Tell me, tell us a little bit about that...</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A:</span></p> <p><span id="s299">out of the .</span> <span id="s300">(Sigh) Anyway, in my naivete (ph) I made a decision that I did not want to go to go back to Bielitz.</span> <span id="s301">There was...there were two camps in Beilitz and uh I mean again there's a story about a young man there who apparently liked me very much.</span> <span id="s302">His name was .</span> <span id="s303">He was a very fine artist and uh his family suggested he with his family that you see you could get out of the if you uh had a place of work, if you had some working permit and uh that you can put, get out to...and uh he had two sisters and they had two sewing machines and they were willing to put one in a shop to secure a place for me, which was an incredible sacrifice.</span> <span id="s304">Uh however I knew that if I did that I would probably have to marry .</span> <span id="s305">I made the decision not to go.</span> <span id="s306">Uh maybe this is a good story to tell because I that I uh I wanted to stay with my friends even though I knew I was going to camp.</span> <span id="s307">By strange, almost incredible coincidence, the man in the who came and told me that I was able to go out...his name is Jacob Chancer (ph).</span> <span id="s308">He now lives in Buffalo, New York, where of course I lived for many years.</span> <span id="s309">That decision proved to be a decision which saved my life because unfortunately the Briggs (ph) family, all of them, were deported and killed about two months later.</span> <span id="s310">And you see uh Beilitz, my home town, was renown for its textiles.</span> <span id="s311">Uh it was called of central Europe.</span> <span id="s312">And uh in the they registered your name, your age, and the place you hail from (ph), and industrialists from all over Germany would come to buy slaves.</span> <span id="s313">A man by the name of Keller (ph)...I think it's good to use the names...his name was Director Keller from a firm called .</span> <span id="s314">had several uh spinning uh weaving and uh textile-oriented and associated firms and they needed people to work in the factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">When he came and he saw that x number of girls from Beilitz were there, for some reason he thought we might have more ex in weaving or whatever and anyway they were always looking because you see that still fairly early.</span> <span id="s316">That was '42.</span> <span id="s317">They needed German speaking people to be trained, so he bought all of us for a place called Bolkenhein (ph) which was a new weaving camp in .</span> <span id="s318">And in fact this is where we went.</span> <span id="s319">In all fairness I must say that uh that camp was probably better than than most of certainly what followed because it was new.</span> <span id="s320">You see, we were only fifty girls there.</span> <span id="s321">And the person who became our lager fuhrer, at first sight she looked like a bulldog and I thought she's going to tear us limb from limb, and she was a very kind person.</span> <span id="s322">She was probably chosen for her looks but we all who were in captivity under her owe her a debt of gratitude.</span> <span id="s323">And I think by her very decency she pinned a lie to the lips of all who said they had no choices.</span> <span id="s324">I won't say she particularly loved us.</span> <span id="s325">She saved my life once for which I'll be eternally grateful and there was uh as far as I know and I do know, that as long as we were there and later in a place called Landeshutz (ph) where she also was, nobody was sent to Auschwitz from our camp, from those two camps.</span> <span id="s326">And uh she showed that people could help individually and she did.</span> <span id="s327">I only met during my entire years under the Nazis, for six years, I only met two who were really kind and I think that they should be singled out for that.</span> <span id="s328">Frau...her name was Frau Keegler (ph), with an umlaut, so uh and we first saw her and she barked and everything...I thought this is the end of it all.</span> <span id="s329">Well we...I was with my friend Yelda (ph) whom I really would like to mention and in the camp there we became as close as sisters.</span> <span id="s330">Yelda was a childhood friend only in the sense that her mother and my mother were friends, you know, but Yelda played the piano beautifully.</span> <span id="s331">She was exquisitely mannered.</span> <span id="s332">My mother always told me how how I should try to be more like Yelda, you know, and of course I hated to play with her.</span> <span id="s333">She seemed to be the paragon of all virtue, and uh we became quite close already in the ghetto when we used to go to the cemetery...it was the only place you could go, but uh in the camps, you see she had a little sister by the name of Kitty and of course Kitty was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s334">My other friend Gretle (ph) had a sister, so the two sisters...you know, everybody sort of had a buddy and Yelda and I became that to each other.</span> <span id="s335">She she showed great promises as a pianist.</span> <span id="s336">She was sent to Vienna uh two years before the war to study at the conservatory there and uh a great future was predicted for her.</span> <span id="s337">And Yelda sort of became my sister.</span> <span id="s338">As a matter of fact, we looked quite a bit alike and uh so it was and there was something else that uh perhaps would give you sort of an inkling what it was like.</span> <span id="s339">On the train to the camp, to Bolkhain, I met a wonderful girl, a vivid redhead, a wonderful, you know, called beautiful people, tall, wonderful girl.</span> <span id="s340">Her name was Suzie Kunz (ph).</span> <span id="s341">She was born in Vienna but her mother had died.</span> <span id="s342">Uh she was quite young and since she was sent to Czechoslovakia to live with her grandparents because you see uh in that particular transport were mostly girls from Beilitz and from Czechoslovakia and you know we were all German speaking and this is why we went to that camp.</span> <span id="s343">And I was standing next to Suzie on on the train.</span> <span id="s344">You know, the it's a train sort of uh...there was a certain freedom there you know.</span> <span id="s345">We were in...not confined at the .</span> <span id="s346">We were out of the and going someplace and uh Suzie said we'll never ever get out of where we are going and I said yes we will.</span> <span id="s347">And I said I'm sure the war will be over in less than a year, and Suzie said no, we're not going to make it.</span> <span id="s348">And I said I'll bet you and she said OK.</span> <span id="s349">She said let's bet a quart of strawberries and a quart of whipped cream and we shook hands on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">And Suzie died on liberation morning.</span> <span id="s351">I found her dead.</span> <span id="s352">I don't know if she knew or if she didn't...she won that bet.</span> <span id="s353">Anyway we came to Bolkenheim.</span> <span id="s354">Bolkenheim...you know uh it's a terrible thing to say but but I think because we are recording that sort of thing should be said...actually for me it it was easier then.</span> <span id="s355">Easier in terms that I didn't see my parents suffer.</span> <span id="s356">You know, I could sort of put things over there but I uh I was convinced that my parents will survive, that they are someplace which they are probably working.</span> <span id="s357">I pushed all thoughts aside and I was in a way liberated in fact but you know I wasn't worried that each of my action might spell danger to my parents.</span> <span id="s358">And you know, I know if somebody's going to beat me, they aren't going to see it.</span> <span id="s359">All the indignities that one has suffered and you know and vice versa, you know.</span> <span id="s360">But of course when you're eighteen years old you know, you have the that you don't...anyway uh Bolkenheim was rough in terms until we mastered what was expected of us.</span> <span id="s361">There was somebody there by the name of Meister Zimmer (ph).</span> <span id="s362">He was dreadful.</span> <span id="s363">And uh I used to amuse myself when he told us all things, you know, that uh that we are going to be taught decency and all the things, you know, uh that I think that that we knew so well which obviously were were designed to break our resistance, you know, and said if we behave ourselves and do these things we can live there all our lives you know, and I used to sort of speculate what he would look like when he was dead and things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s364">Uh now I..</span> <span id="s365">.</span> <span id="s366">I..</span> <span id="s367">.</span> <span id="s368">you know, fortunately uh you know I I always wrote when I was a little girl and things like that and I I could lift myself from some of the things and do other things in my mind to remove that, and I think I did that in the very first weeks when we were there.</span> <span id="s369">But you know, he used to sit with, stand with a watch, with a stop watch, and you had to do which are uh was very intricate uh...what do you call it...it's funny...I lapse into German now...uh to tie something, a knot, you know, a weaver's knot to be exact, and you had to do x number a minute and of course you can imagine when you have somebody standing with a stopwatch above you to do that uh your life on that.</span> <span id="s370">But for some reason most of us were able to do it and those who were not were put in the spinner or in other things, so nobody was sent to Auschwitz from the original fifty there.</span> <span id="s371">And it was by comparison of what came later, relatively easy in as much...I mean we were not that hungry.</span> <span id="s372">We we got some food because Mrs. Keegler was decent.</span> <span id="s373">Uh we uh we worked in the factory long hours and I think that was really the very best thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">We were so exhausted at the end of the day that you had to concentrate so much and to work, you know, that your mind couldn't absorb what...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: I think at this point we need to pause.</span> <span id="s376">We will change tapes and that will give you a chance to.....</span></p> <p><span id="s377">End of tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s379">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s381">We are back on tape.</span> <span id="s382">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s384">You were telling me about uh the camp and the weaving...</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: The weaving...(pause)...we were able to write letters and again in that uh Mrs. Keegler was quite generous because I don't remember exactly, you know, what the ratio was, how often you were permitted to, but of course you know there were...who could you write to, but I was fortunate that I had my father's address in which way my father was allegedly working on the fortification of that river and uh I wrote to my father.</span> <span id="s386">Uh I did not hear.</span> <span id="s387">Of course I heard from and I wrote to him and he started sending me letters as well as packages which again through the type of person that Mrs. Keegler was, those packages did arrive.</span> <span id="s388">Uh I wrote to my father and I waited to hear from my father and one day a most incredible thing happened.</span> <span id="s389">Mrs. Keegler was handing out mail and she called my name and I saw a letter and I jumped to get it, and then I realized it was the letter which I had wrote written to my father and on it it said, without forwarding address.</span> <span id="s390">Uh I think that we needn't go into that.</span> <span id="s391">No one think that I I lost my my speech for a day and a night.</span> <span id="s392">I I could not utter a sound.</span> <span id="s393">Anyway uh we worked there and uh the thing was uh, you see, the type of thing that I I don't know if it really comes across is the tremendous support system which existed in the camps.</span> <span id="s394">The love and the friendship and the sharing and caring and loyalties that people had for each other, the girls had for each other.</span> <span id="s395">Uh you know that was sort of the balance against the cruelty which we experienced and to me I feel that was probably one of the most important things that existed and I somehow wish that would filter down.</span> <span id="s396">I usually attempt to tell my children and now my grandchildren because in the very odd spiritual airs of those who did not survive to know that the legacy of the camps is not the legacy of the horror but of the greatness of our people, the very humanity which existed there in the face of such incredible inhumanity.</span> <span id="s397">Uh I particularly want to talk about my friend Yelda (ph) for a moment but that actually happened in in another camp.</span> <span id="s398">I I'll give you the quick progression from camp to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">We were in Waldenheim, if I remember correctly when you know we were working on looms and pretty soon uh the raw materials started to disappear.</span> <span id="s400">We we had to uh work on uh uh paper.</span> <span id="s401">There was paper that they were spinning and of course you know in the warm weather it became brittle and it would break and uh in cold weather it would disintegrate because it got soft, and uh was, you know, those things tore the things which what happened to me.</span> <span id="s402">Uh for that you could you could be sent to Auschwitz but somehow Mrs. Keegler intervened that people were not, and I remember at one time which was what I wanted to talk about Frau Keegler.</span> <span id="s403">Uh it was shortly after I received the news about my father uh that I became very ill.</span> <span id="s404">I don't know exactly what I had but I know that all my fingernails started to have pus in it and I couldn't touch my hands and and I was running a very high fever and we had sort of a little...it was called in which people were sick for a day or two could stay, and I was there and all of a sudden Lindsay (ph), you know, I think he has quite a name in the SS, he came on a sudden inspection and Frau Keegler charged into the room.</span> <span id="s405">I omitted to say my father made me wear my skiing boots.</span> <span id="s406">When I left home...I last saw my father on the 28th of June and I left home the 29th and I was separated from my mother the following day.</span> <span id="s407">Before my father left, he said to me wear you skiing boots.</span> <span id="s408">We were all avid skiers, you know.</span> <span id="s409">We lived in the the ski mountains.</span> <span id="s410">A lot of skiing there.</span> <span id="s411">And I said why and my father said I want you to wear them and I said Poppa, skiing shoes in June...you know, I ought to wear a pair of sandals and my father said you have to wear them.</span> <span id="s412">You know, you didn't argue with your father in those days.</span> <span id="s413">I wore them and I blessed them every single day because I wore them for the entire three years that I was in camp and in the in the lining I had hidden the pictures which are now in my book.</span> <span id="s414">This is where the pictures were.</span> <span id="s415">At first I was able to keep them, at the first camp, but later on and on the death march I had concealed them there.</span> <span id="s416">So Mrs. Keegler charged in and she dragged me out of of the bunk and she said Lindsay is here.</span> <span id="s417">It's a matter of life and death.</span> <span id="s418">I'll take you to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">And she stooped down and she started to lace my boots and she dragged me to the factory.</span> <span id="s420">She used to work in the factory before and I worked on four looms and she set the looms in motion and she said to me, pull yourself together and I remember I still heard the beating of the loom, you know, and everything was sort of at different angles because I was running a very high temperature and he came for inspection.</span> <span id="s421">He went through and if he would have found me there, she could not have saved me and there was no question about it, so that was how Keegler...but pretty soon it became obvious that the uh that they needed us in another camp and uh our camp was disbanded and we went to uh I think three different ones, Matzdorf (ph), .</span> <span id="s422">I really don't remember the third one.</span> <span id="s423">I was sent to Matzdorf.</span> <span id="s424">Matzdorf was a horrible, horrible camp.</span> <span id="s425">Uh we were locked on the fifth or sixth floor and uh every morning they would wake us with whips.</span> <span id="s426">I worked in the flax detail which was a dreadful place.</span> <span id="s427">Uh they were doing linens there, and flax uh submerged in a swamp.</span> <span id="s428">You had to pull it out of the swamp, you know, and uh when you opened the things and retracted the flax.</span> <span id="s429">It was terribly hot.</span> <span id="s430">It was in summer and the mosquitos were all over us when we were working there and then I I was singled out to do something else, namely to unload coal at night.</span> <span id="s431">Allegedly I give fresh answer to uh to one of the supervisors.</span> <span id="s432">They are men, and for that I was banished to work the flax during the day and at the coal detail at night.</span> <span id="s433">Uh it was an incredible time.</span> <span id="s434">Then we...I also to load the flax uh into sort of silos which were I mean I think now that they were ten stories high.</span> <span id="s435">They probably were not.</span> <span id="s436">They probably were three or four, but you know you there was no balance because those things.</span> <span id="s437">I I remember that it was nothing but torture you know.</span> <span id="s438">As soon as we went back to camp, I was called to to go and went and unload coal and that was the only time.</span> <span id="s439">You know my father had asked me earlier...I forgot to mention it...during the first when my mother was so ill...I remember standing at the window and we heard that a family had committed suicide together.</span> <span id="s440">And I remember standing at that window looking out at the garden, my mother being so sick, my father with his hand in in the sling.</span> <span id="s441">I hadn't...we hadn't heard from Arthur, you know, and I wished that my parents would suggest that.</span> <span id="s442">My father and I were both very close and he always knew what I was thinking, and I remember he came behind me and he said, without looking at me, he said, what you are thinking now is cowardly.</span> <span id="s443">He said promise that you are never going to do that.</span> <span id="s444">I didn't answer him and he took his hand and he turned my head towards him and he said I want your promise now.</span> <span id="s445">And I promised him.</span> <span id="s446">And I remembered it during the working in the coal trucks.</span> <span id="s447">There were trains going by.</span> <span id="s448">I didn't know if they were going to Auschwitz or whatever, and I remember sort of the tracks beckoning in the moonlight and I thought, you know, it would be over very quick.</span> <span id="s449">One jump and one pain and that's going to be it because it was so dreadful there.</span> <span id="s450">And at one moment I think I really came fairly close.</span> <span id="s451">I felt a very strange pain in my neck.</span> <span id="s452">Anyway, obviously I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s453">So...when things were really very very hard in Matzdorf we worked in the swamp one days and I think that was really one of my lowest hours, when...we had a lager fuhrer in there who was the exact opposite of Mrs. Keegler.</span> <span id="s454">She was maybe eighteen years old, sort of an over-blown thing and she was wearing rings on every finger and uh and her great joy was to have a little wagon, like a child's wagon, and she had us pull her around in that wagon.</span> <span id="s455">She was having a whip about it...I mean, you can't imagine the calibre of or the intelligence of that person.</span> <span id="s456">And all of a sudden she came with somebody else, with a man, and they said...they were calling numbers.</span> <span id="s457">You see we all had numbers, of course.</span> <span id="s458">And they were calling numbers and I was working next to Yelda and heard them call her number, and I sort of looked up.</span> <span id="s459">I must have been dazed, and she pointed and the lager fuhrer and said you idiots.</span> <span id="s460">Don't you even know your own numbers, and Yelda pointed to me and she said that is her number.</span> <span id="s461">I didn't understand what she was doing.</span> <span id="s462">She obviously wanted to get me out from whatever it was, so the lager came and naturally slapped me and she said don't you even know your own number, you idiot and so I..</span> <span id="s463">.</span> <span id="s464">and since they called my real number and we didn't know what was happening or maybe Yelda...I'm I'm really not quite sure on that, but what happened was as we came to the camp, there was Director Keller from Waldenheim.</span> <span id="s465">Also I have an interesting thing to tell you about him.</span> <span id="s466">And Yelda fell to her knees and she said my sister, you don't have her number, something like that, and he looked at me and he says I know you.</span> <span id="s467">You worked on four looms.</span> <span id="s468">You're coming along.</span> <span id="s469">They needed more people for uh working on looms in another camp called Landeshutz (ph) and this is how I got out of Matzdorf and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a truck and we went to Landeshutz which was the other, the sister camp.</span> <span id="s470">You see if they had crossbars behind the open Landeshutz to Matzdorf and one more and when we got there, who would be there but Frau Keegler was in charge of that camp, so that was like a homecoming.</span> <span id="s471">So this is how...I had one incident with Keller.</span> <span id="s472">He called me into his office once and I just remember this most incredible thing.</span> <span id="s473">There was that hugh hugh room or at least to me it seemed hugh with a single carpet and a desk on it and he sat alone at the desk and what struck me is that probably in a room of that size, fifty of us slept.</span> <span id="s474">You know, I think that...and he had a letter in his hand and he said to me you have smuggled out a letter from the camp .</span> <span id="s475">I said I never smuggled a letter.</span> <span id="s476">I said I have written some letters and and when I glanced over it I saw...I had an uncle in Turkey who was in the textile business because, you know, most people from Beilitz were in the textile, and my unc...and I gathered that he knew my uncle because it was a letter later on my uncle told me he had written to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Who had written to who?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: My uncle had...when he found out in what camp I was, had written to my, to Keller about me because he had that thing in his...Keller looked at me and he asked me a number of questions.</span> <span id="s479">Interesting thing was that apparently my uncle had sent a package and they encouraged me to write for more packages.</span> <span id="s480">The packages apparently contained chocolate and things which were not obtainable, which I never saw.</span> <span id="s481">They said the package must have been ripped up but it looked in a very sturdy wooden box but I was only too happy to write to my uncle that I received the packages I was told in very good order because apparently they wanted those things but this way I knew that my uncle was...I mean I knew my uncle was safe.</span> <span id="s482">He was in Turkey but that he knew where I was.</span> <span id="s483">Anyway getting back to the thing...of course we came to Landeshutz which like heaven by comparison with Matzdorf.</span> <span id="s484">Uh only in Landeshutz we then faced an...another difficulty.</span> <span id="s485">And that difficulty was that we worked the night shift only.</span> <span id="s486">So you know, we didn't see any light of day except, you know, uh if you got up during the day you you could and we worked there from probably a year or maybe even longer, on the night shift, but you know Frau Keegler was there.</span> <span id="s487">Things got worse there because there was very little food but uh she she went on in the same vein that she was before, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Tell us a little bit more about Landeshutz and Frau Keegler...</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Uh for instance, you know, if somebody was ill, if somebody got ill, you know, there were not the things which happened in other camps, sent to Auschwitz or beatings or things like that.</span> <span id="s490">Uh you got some sort of care or understanding or it was...things were covered for you a bit, you know, as far as work was concerned.</span> <span id="s491">Uh she tried to to get vegetables.</span> <span id="s492">I don't know what rations there were, you know, but it it whatever was so- called coming to us and believe me things were uh laughable but we got it.</span> <span id="s493">Uh I remember when this one thing that I always tell young people.</span> <span id="s494">Uh you know they knew of the Jewish holidays and there was one Yom Kippur when they marched us out and told us about the holidays and told uh that if anybody would be foolish enough to fast that that would be construed as sabotage and sabotage was punishable by death, and everybody fasted and uh we were given noodles and sugar and nobody touched it and I think you know those are the things that I think future generations should know and to me this was...and I remember then that night when we got our miserable smelling vegetables or whatever it was, there was such a feeling of sanctity, I think almost holiness, you know, and they really jumped.</span> <span id="s495">She tried to to see that we you know if if we didn't...everybody worked with uh uh you know al..</span> <span id="s496">.</span> <span id="s497">almost with with such fervor and things that we couldn't falter.</span> <span id="s498">And I think that without such a oneness, such a..</span> <span id="s499">.</span> <span id="s500">I saw so much nobility of spirit in the camps which somehow I wish would be better recorded, you know, when people reached out, you know...somebody had a birthday so uh we would uh save...on Sunday we had margarine, a little margarine on the bread, so you know you would cut off some of the bread and scrape the margarine and and give it to the person on the bread that she would have a lot of margarine on on her piece of bread.</span> <span id="s501">On Hanukkah, we knew it was Hanukkah and that was still under Mrs. Keegler, and she was busy celebrating...Hanukkah and Christmas are together...you know, and she closed an eye to that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s502">We uh made a menorah (ph) out of potatoes and uh of course we knew that you know we couldn't light but we made a menorah out of potatoes and I I still have the things which I wrote about the story about Hanukkah which we sang.</span> <span id="s503">I would like to translate it and give it to you.</span> <span id="s504">I had a wonder...if I may skip for one minute just to make a happier thing...when I went to Israel for the first time in 1961 I my friends surprised me.</span> <span id="s505">I knew of three that were in Israel but actually ten showed up and I was the eleventh, and they got out of the elevator in Tel Aviv, singing a song which we had written for the first Hanukkah in camp, and we carried the menorah which I naturally have now, a beautiful old silver menorah that they give me in memory of the menorah which we made out of the potatoes, and you know when you made it out of potatoes it meant you didn't eat that night because, you know, you didn't have potatoes.</span> <span id="s506">You can imagine what that menorah means when my husband kindles the lights and we see our grandchild reflected in that...it's truly .</span> <span id="s507">Uh so you know, that was possible under Frau Keegler and one of the things that we did was Yelda and I dressed as grandmothers and you know, under the looms which we worked there was sort of a white powdery substance.</span> <span id="s508">We put it on our hair to grey and uh and we had a performance between the bunks under one naked electric light and see the faces in the bunks, you know.</span> <span id="s509">What we did is we started out with uh you know there were two grandmothers and everything, and comes to the and says oh .</span> <span id="s510">That's how how it started out and then we of course predicted a brilliant future for everyone and then our two granddaughters came to listen to us.</span> <span id="s511">Strangely enough the person who played my granddaughter...her name is Hilda Steinhart Goldschmidt (ph).</span> <span id="s512">She lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s513">Her son was one of the heros of the Six Day War.</span> <span id="s514">Hilda never lived to have a grandchild and so the one who played her granddaughter did not survive and our granddaughters listened to our tale of the past and uh I'll say it in German.</span> <span id="s515">The exit line on that was uh .</span> <span id="s516">Do you understand German?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Translate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Uh come and look.</span> <span id="s519">I'll show you my newest , you know, what the granddaughter says... , OK.</span> <span id="s520">Then the , because old people uh exaggerate so much and then we see them exiting.</span> <span id="s521">Now mind you we were eighteen years old at the time and we say to each other, .</span> <span id="s522">Dear children, let us just say that uh humans endure more than they think they could.</span> <span id="s523">And I think somehow uh considering how how young we were, we must have touched the core of our existence, the hope that someday to live in a world where our children and grandchildren would live, but best of all to live in such a climate where they will not believe our tales of the past.</span> <span id="s524">And that was possible under Frau Keegler.</span> <span id="s525">I mean she didn't exactly hear the performance, you know, and and we would sing songs in which we would say, you know, would make probably sound like a summer camp there you know for her ears and and then we would throw in a few things in Polish, you know, which were exactly not meant for her ears, but but by and large uh that part in contrast of uh...of course you know we were fortunate, quote, unquote, that we were taken early yet, you know, before Auschwitz was in its full aspect of the...because after that people didn't go to working camps anymore.</span> <span id="s526">OK.</span> <span id="s527">Briefly uh and finally Landeshutz was liquidated and we went to the most miserable and bitter camp called Gruenberg (ph) in .</span> <span id="s528">Uh Gruenberg was an enormous camp.</span> <span id="s529">Uh its factory was one of the most beautiful in Germany in as much that it boasted the most beautiful collection of roses surrounding the factory.</span> <span id="s530">It was direct contradiction of the beauty the was in.</span> <span id="s531">Uh I don't remember his name now...we called him LaLouche (ph).</span> <span id="s532">I will have to remember his name.</span> <span id="s533">That was the most brutal, sadistic uh...I don't know if he was director but he was one of the people there.</span> <span id="s534">He wore a signet ring on his hand and and he would jump like a cat and beat his victim until blood showed, mostly beat the faces.</span> <span id="s535">He would have sort of a glazed look on his face.</span> <span id="s536">I don't know if...I tried to suppress the feeling...we called him Lalouche.</span> <span id="s537">He was a beast.</span> <span id="s538">Uh things changed very drastically then.</span> <span id="s539">I still worked in uh for a very little time in the weaving factories, but pretty soon they had very little raw material for that and I was moved into what was considered sentence of death...spin ...spinning.</span> <span id="s540">Uh we were spinning fabrics or rather threads which came from raw materials which...the raw material consisted of clothing which came from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s541">It came to a place called .</span> <span id="s542">are hugh machines which sort of shred that.</span> <span id="s543">Uh it was not difficult to imagine that some of the clothes belonged to our parents.</span> <span id="s544">Uh I worked most of the time on the night shift there and I remember when whenever the the horror of some of that became overwhelming, one or at least I played a game.</span> <span id="s545">I perfected it.</span> <span id="s546">And that was to imagine my homecoming, with all the details being there including the sort of things that we had long sold but it was the miracle of freedom would always be there.</span> <span id="s547">In any event, the most dreaded thing on in Gruenberg was that...I'm not quite sure now if it was every four or every six weeks...we would go to a doctor's office to be x-rayed because tuberculous was rampant and whoever displayed anything was immediately sent to Auschwitz, so you had to leave some life, usually between four and six weeks...I don't remember now if it was four or six weeks.</span> <span id="s548">Uh there was something there with those x-rays.</span> <span id="s549">I uh did a thing which I will always regret.</span> <span id="s550">Uh the last day that I was with my brother, we had to go to the which was something that like the Jewish Federation, you know, when he did his registering, and we uh next to it was the ruins of the temple and we climbed over the debris and we sat there for a moment and one column of the eastern wall stood un...undisturbed and everything else was in ruin and Arthur picked up a little stone and he handed it to me and he said just look at that column and always remember that our people will survive.</span> <span id="s551">And he give me the stone, and I made a little sack of it and I carried it on my neck, and when we went to to x-rays I took it off and I had it in my pocket and I don't know...it was later probably...I think it was on the death march that I lost it.</span> <span id="s552">And that was the one thing that I would...you know, pictures survived because I had them in my boot, but I lost that piece of stone.</span> <span id="s553">Anyway, this was about Gruenberg.</span> <span id="s554">Gruenberg was a miserable camp.</span> <span id="s555">There was a lot of people being sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s556">And and then see we knew that things were going bad with the war because there were uh not bombings but we had uh sirens were blowing every so often and uh we had to stop working.</span> <span id="s557">There was no electricity, and they were going crazy being vicious.</span> <span id="s558">Everybody there was incredibly bad.</span> <span id="s559">They made us stand outside for for hours on appell, you know.</span> <span id="s560">And uh if a piece of bread flew over the fence, which it once did, everybody was beaten and to say who who got it.</span> <span id="s561">I'm proud to say about our people that nobody gave away the culprit.</span> <span id="s562">We all knew who it was, and I think that this is that...you know, uh what has troubled me so much that I have read some of the accounts that people say how cruel people were, how they stepped on each other, or they make it sound like it was like a snake pit that people for survival.</span> <span id="s563">Look, I don't know what happened in other camps, and this is why, you know, I have always used my maiden name on everything that I have written .</span> <span id="s564">I would say that people behaved in the most incredible manner imaginable by and large.</span> <span id="s565">And I think that this would be something that cannot be emphasized enough.</span> <span id="s566">It was in Gruenberg that Yelda once found a raspberry in the gutter on the way to the factory.</span> <span id="s567">She carried it in her pocket all day long and presented it to me that night on a leaf which she plucked through the barbed wire, had washed it, and gave it to me as a present.</span> <span id="s568">I asked her to take a little bit of a bite and she wouldn't.</span> <span id="s569">One single raspberry.</span> <span id="s570">A total possession.</span> <span id="s571">She gave it to a friend.</span> <span id="s572">There were other acts like that, many.</span> <span id="s573">They unfortunately are not recorded.</span> <span id="s574">And I think this is probably the greatest tragedy of them all.</span> <span id="s575">The nobility and the love that was felt.</span> <span id="s576">Anyway when things got really bad, you know, you sort of knew when things are going bad for the Germans, they're probably going to finish us.</span> <span id="s577">When things are going good for for them or well for them I should say, uh they aren't going to let us go.</span> <span id="s578">I know we will forever be slave, you know.</span> <span id="s579">It sort of varies what is going to happen, and that became our obvious in January of 1945 where one day uh we knew...we were told we were not going to go to the factory any longer, to gather our meager belongings of whatever that was.</span> <span id="s580">Uh the night between the 28th and 29th of January, with great commotion and suddenly the doors opened.</span> <span id="s581">The camp, you know...we we were then about two thousand girls.</span> <span id="s582">An additional transport of two thousand came from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s583">They told us they had walked for I don't know how long from Auschwitz and we were going to to go on a march the following morning.</span> <span id="s584">Destination later on we heard Orianienberg.</span> <span id="s585">Orianienberg was a murder camp also, small enough known near Berlin which fell into the hands of the Allies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on Berlin and we started to march now to to...the death march, 29th of January.</span> <span id="s586">I remember I had a terrible cold.</span> <span id="s587">I was coughing terribly.</span> <span id="s588">Uh we were told to assemble in four abreast.</span> <span id="s589">Was Yelda, Suzie and Leisle (ph).</span> <span id="s590">Leisle was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen.</span> <span id="s591">She sort of...she moved like a deer, had hugh brown eyes, .</span> <span id="s592">She and Suzie were were sort of like sisters as Yelda was and I, you know, but the four of us together.</span> <span id="s593">Lei...Leisle was from from Czechoslovakia and Suzie was from Czechoslovakia and Yelda and I from Beilitz and the four of us sort of formed friendships, you know.</span> <span id="s594">Leisle was the sort who looked after me.</span> <span id="s595">I would say oh, it's raining today.</span> <span id="s596">Do you think I should wear my green raincoat?</span> <span id="s597">And she would say no, wear the navy blue one and have you been to the garden to pick up apples yet.</span> <span id="s598">I mean she would fall into any imaginary game and I remember that morning very vividly.</span> <span id="s599">You know there's such scenes in Dr. Zhavigo (ph) when you see this incredible uh almost like a wasteland of white...it was freshly covered snow.</span> <span id="s600">The snow, it had snowed during the night and the whole thing in front of the camp in effect...it was all all covered with snow and uh we were assembled and and they lifted their whips and forward, march.</span> <span id="s601">And I remember Yelda said to me, she said I don't know how you're going to make it.</span> <span id="s602">We'll all make it.</span> <span id="s603">And I was coughing so hard and we started the first step and I remember taking that step and I remember saying to myself this is the last chapter.</span> <span id="s604">But you know, I never had any doubt that we'll make it.</span> <span id="s605">And Yelda was to my left, Leisle next to me and Suzie on the extreme right.</span> <span id="s606">And I'm the only one left.</span> <span id="s607">I think the march is documented in I'm sure many other stories.</span> <span id="s608">(Pause) It was unspeakable.</span> <span id="s609">I had my skiing boots.</span> <span id="s610">I was the best equipped because I had my boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">It...(pause)...at first we still had a little bit to eat that we took along and hoarded.</span> <span id="s612">We marched I don't know how many miles a day.</span> <span id="s613">We came to rest sometimes in in a barn.</span> <span id="s614">A lot of...we stopped in a camp called where blessedly a few of our girls escaped.</span> <span id="s615">I didn't.</span> <span id="s616">Uh people were shot continuously.</span> <span id="s617">If somebody stepped out of line, then you would see snow being red and there through the forest, beautifully covered with snow and birds chirped sometimes and uh we were marching.</span> <span id="s618">Everyday the number got smaller and then we came (sniffling) to a place called Flossenberg and in Flossenberg, Yelda was already very sick.</span> <span id="s619">Leisle, Suzie and I were still going pretty strong.</span> <span id="s620">One time we had nothing to eat so we started eating snow which was a terrible thing to do because the more you eat, the more thirsty you are.</span> <span id="s621">And of course then diarhhrea and all was rampant.</span> <span id="s622">Uh when we left one morning, one time they uh put us outside.</span> <span id="s623">They would spray us with water and then they would herd us, literally hundreds into a small and everybody started to perspire, put us out again and pneumonia was just like that (snapping fingers)...people died like flies.</span> <span id="s624">Then one morning we were told, for example, we were going to leave there.</span> <span id="s625">I remember Yelda was frantic.</span> <span id="s626">She said that's going to be the end.</span> <span id="s627">I don't want to leave.</span> <span id="s628">And I said if we are so much better off out in you know in the open.</span> <span id="s629">Maybe we'll have a better chance.</span> <span id="s630">And all of a sudden came in an incredible announcement, that President Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s631">Then I knew it was too late to run because you know we reconstructed at the time was and jubilation broke out, that all the enemies of the Fuhrer will perish in such a manner.</span> <span id="s632">It was a horrible blow, horrible.</span> <span id="s633">But we found something that day which sort of compensated us a little for that.</span> <span id="s634">We found a wrapper of margarine and there was still some little vestiges of margarine stuck to it, so we licked it dry.</span> <span id="s635">We thought we'll certainly get very strong.</span> <span id="s636">And things got very bad from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Yelda was really very, very bad.</span> <span id="s638">And one night we slept in...we all used to sleep outside and uh it started to snow and sort of reminded me of the story, you know, there's little and went around that everybody don't sleep, get up, because if you fall asleep and it started snowing, you know, you'll never wake up.</span> <span id="s639">Some people said it's the best thing we can do is fall asleep like that, and uh then one...we came to an orchard and before we came to that orchard sort of something incredible happened.</span> <span id="s640">Oh yes...one time before that, because I thought Yelda was so sick, I said to her well we heard, you know...we saw a lot of people on the road already...it was an evacuation and people were on wagons sort of similar to when the war started, you know.</span> <span id="s641">And those people were running away from the front, and we heard somebody talking in a similar dialect, German dialect, that we had, so we concocted a whole sort of story, that we will run away in the next thing, and we will say that we, you know, will take our and we would say that we were with our mother on the on the wagon and we got lost, you know, and that we are from Beilitz because we had a similar dialect and of course with names like Yelda and Gerda you know, it was...and we we really had a whole thing how we are going to do it and Leisle and and Suzie were doing something similar, and we said our father was in the Wermarcht and in order to get the numbers if we felt you know , we used our house numbers and 1939 when the war...had to make it a long number that, you know, if they asked, so they will see that we tell the truth.</span> <span id="s642">And we came into that little forest where we rested, and uh sort of took a signal to each other that we are going to stay there when they say everybody assembled.</span> <span id="s643">And suddenly Yelda looked up at me and she said I'm afraid.</span> <span id="s644">And I was going to say come on, you know...and I didn't.</span> <span id="s645">And when we got out of the forest, they rounded up fourteen girls, some of our best friends were in the forest and we saw them all being shot.</span> <span id="s646">Right then and there I decided no matter what happens I'm never going to run away.</span> <span id="s647">I'll go to the end whatever the end is, but I'm not going to attempt to run away, you know, because we've had people already running and, you know, and uh the Gestapo, the SS was not too much in charge and, you know, it would be it would be OK, but we made a pact until then I said we're never going to run away.</span> <span id="s648">We were just saved by by her not, by her saying, you know, don't run.</span> <span id="s649">And we...it was either that day or the next day...I don't remember, an incredible thing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">People were running in the streets and threw bread at us.</span> <span id="s651">And so we had bread and that night we rested in an orchard.</span> <span id="s652">It was again it was snow...it started to...it was spring already.</span> <span id="s653">It was April and this was after President Roosevelt's uh death...it was something like maybe the third week in April.</span> <span id="s654">And uh I told Yelda to watch the bread, to hold on to it.</span> <span id="s655">She was really very funny, already at this point.</span> <span id="s656">And my very dear friend uh ran away and she survived.</span> <span id="s657">She's in in Detroit.</span> <span id="s658">That's quite a story to tell you about her...how I found, how we found each other after the war.</span> <span id="s659">And uh what we didn't realize was that we had crossed over to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s660">And those were the Czech people who were throwing bread and you see, if I would have known that I would have stayed because they would have hidden us.</span> <span id="s661">We would not be, you know, because if you could make it and went to a barn or something, very possibly so the German farmers turned the girls over to be killed.</span> <span id="s662">But never in Czechoslovakia...the Czech people threw us things and then there was a wagon and they threw something.</span> <span id="s663">It landed and it was an egg, and I was sure that that egg is going to make Yelda get well.</span> <span id="s664">Hadn't seen an egg in years and years.</span> <span id="s665">And Yelda didn't even feel like having it.</span> <span id="s666">And then one night we were again out in a meadow...snowing or raining...and a very dear friend of mine...her name is Keller...she lives in Israel...came by and she brought two potatoes.</span> <span id="s667">I don't know where she found it.</span> <span id="s668">And I remember I devoured mine.</span> <span id="s669">I was so hungry and Yelda had the other one and Yelda said I'm not hungry.</span> <span id="s670">I just couldn't believe it that she wasn't hungry.</span> <span id="s671">And she said to me you eat it.</span> <span id="s672">And I said maybe she'll feel better later, so I kept it and said I'll hold it for you.</span> <span id="s673">(Pause) She said she was thirsty, and I went to try to get water for her, and an SS man came and kicked her and she said why.</span> <span id="s674">(Pause) And then I tried to catch some water in my hand for her.</span> <span id="s675">(Pause) Then she said something incredible.</span> <span id="s676">She said I'm not angry at anyone.</span> <span id="s677">I hope no one is angry at me.</span> <span id="s678">And then she said to me, you are going to survive.</span> <span id="s679">And she said if my parents survived, don't tell them how I died.</span> <span id="s680">(Pause) (Crying) And then she said something else.</span> <span id="s681">She said to me you have to promise me that you are going to go on for one more week.</span> <span id="s682">A week was a very long time.</span> <span id="s683">And she said promise.</span> <span id="s684">And I said I'll try.</span> <span id="s685">When daylight broke, and I had...there were some, there were some blossoms on the trees and I had gone earlier and I had gotten a blossom for her to smell, and I showed her the blossom...it was all dead, probably from her fever, and when the sun got up, it was over for her.</span> <span id="s686">And we were told to bury the dead of that night.</span> <span id="s687">I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s688">It's strange...I know she was buried because my friend told me under a tree.</span> <span id="s689">I remember the most minute details and places, names of cities and towns where we went through...I still and I cannot remember the name of the place where she died.</span> <span id="s690">I can't.</span> <span id="s691">And sometimes I wonder perhaps it is so that that every tree sort of reminds me of her.</span> <span id="s692">You know, she's become over the years my my alter ego, my with my childhood.</span> <span id="s693">And every year on the 29th of April I sort of step back and did for me some incredible things that happened on the 29th.</span> <span id="s694">In the past how many years, forty-eight years...no, forty-five, forty-five years.</span> <span id="s695">Forty-nine...from 1945.</span> <span id="s696">I didn't see Suzie and Leisle.</span> <span id="s697">I didn't know where they were because by that point I couldn't walk very well myself and I don't know now if it was a few days later, whatever, they really descended on us, and with tremendous vengeance, screaming it was all our fault because the Fuhrer is told...you know, Hitler is dead.</span> <span id="s698">We felt if it was true then either they're going to kill us now or maybe we will survive.</span> <span id="s699">It was uh we came to a place in Czechoslovakia...things were really quite crazy, you know.</span> <span id="s700">A lot of people were on on the roads again and uh soldiers running away and but we were still with the group.</span> <span id="s701">We had one woman SS with us and a couple of men.</span> <span id="s702">I don't know to to how few our group had uh...it diminished enormously from thousands to a handful, maybe a little over a hundred and I I think I was quite ill already, you know, because...I know, I mean I was ill anyway and and terrible upset about, you know, Yelda's death and uh one evening we came to rest...was a place...oh, a place in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s703">We were in Czechoslovakia at that point, of course.</span> <span id="s704">And and that place was called which I only realized that later.</span> <span id="s705">Uh we were sort of outside.</span> <span id="s706">It was quite quiet suddenly and uh a truck came.</span> <span id="s707">We were going to go some place and my friend...oh yeah, and one SS woman came and told Keller...the one who's in Israel...to take off my boots.</span> <span id="s708">Apparently she wanted...she saw I had good boots.</span> <span id="s709">She liked my skiing boots.</span> <span id="s710">And said to me, I'll come, I'll hide you, and she hid me in some , pretended, you know, there wasn't...she never took them off.</span> <span id="s711">And then said to me, uh and a truck came and the truck was going to take us someplace.</span> <span id="s712">I have no idea where.</span> <span id="s713">And she said you better get on that truck, so that she shouldn't see you.</span> <span id="s714">And I suddenly said to her, you know, I really want to stay here.</span> <span id="s715">I don't know what but I'm in no hurry, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s716">And it sort of was a feeling that it is probably going to happen now.</span> <span id="s717">They're going to kill us and I uh it was sort of at that point quite warm.</span> <span id="s718">After all the snow, you know, it was a balmy night and I thought to myself it's all over.</span> <span id="s719">I'm going to start thinking what it would be like for a night like that being home, being in the garden with my parents, so if they kill me that's the memory I want.</span> <span id="s720">And the people, trucks came and some of our girls went on it.</span> <span id="s721">I didn't.</span> <span id="s722">We waited and waited and waited but the truck did not come back and fortunately I heard that on that truck uh there was one of the SS women who was pregnant apparently.</span> <span id="s723">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s724">And uh I don't know if they were shooting, and she was hurt and one of the SS men then turned and killed fourteen girls on that truck.</span> <span id="s725">Fourteen.</span> <span id="s726">No, I think it was fourteen before.</span> <span id="s727">You know, it's funny how how you play with numbers...fourteen or was it twenty-five.</span> <span id="s728">I really don't know but a goodly number of girls.</span> <span id="s729">And we stayed there and uh and they came back for us and took us into sort of a barrack or a hole or something like that and they locked us up there.</span> <span id="s730">We heard a lot of commotion.</span> <span id="s731">There was uh shooting and there were planes overhead and everything, and then the story had it uh that they uh attached a time bomb.</span> <span id="s732">It was strange...we just went my husband and I to a reunion of the 5th Division Medical Corps who were our liberators and they spoke about that bomb and how the was there.</span> <span id="s733">I mean, you know, for a while we thought you know maybe they just threatened it was a bomb or something but apparently that was so, and they barricaded the doors with chains and things and we, you know, we sort to moved.</span> <span id="s734">They told that we are going to be killed and I think before that there was some shooting.</span> <span id="s735">I remember some shooting was going on like it was here and there.</span> <span id="s736">Nothing nothing happened...just a little skin, and uh you know, at that point I must confess that I'm not absolutely clear.</span> <span id="s737">Must have been quite ill already or or whatever but I remember sort of that night it was quite turbulent and I remember them curling up and sort of uh the SS left and they left their coats and things behind and I sort of went and and tried to sleep there.</span> <span id="s738">A lot of people were very ill.</span> <span id="s739">We knew the Americans were coming.</span> <span id="s740">I saw two the night before, and then there was the crazy night and in the morning I asked where...I asked Leisle...she was...this was the biggest irony of them all.</span> <span id="s741">They were shooting from planes and Suzie was hit in the foot.</span> <span id="s742">Not Suzie, Leisle.</span> <span id="s743">And she was lying there on the straw and I asked her where Suzie was.</span> <span id="s744">It was morning and she told me that Suzie went to find some water at the pump and I went to look for her and there she was, lying in the mud and she was dead.</span> <span id="s745">And I didn't want to go back to tell Leisle that.</span> <span id="s746">So I I went out.</span> <span id="s747">You see, I had seen...there were two Americans the night before.</span> <span id="s748">I spoke to them sort of.</span> <span id="s749">But that that is very vague to me.</span> <span id="s750">But I remember all the things of that morning and that was after I had found Suzie and I couldn't tell Leisle so I went outside and I stood sort of in the doorway.</span> <span id="s751">It was a brilliant morning.</span> <span id="s752">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s753">I have to tell you that I saw that morning on a steeple of the church a homemade white flag of peace.</span> <span id="s754">And I remember that was the first time I cried in many many months.</span> <span id="s755">It was a strange thing that I remember that my tears...you know, it's funny because now I cry at the slightest provocation.</span> <span id="s756">I cry when I see a dog or cat or something like that but didn't cry for many years.</span> <span id="s757">And uh and I was standing there and saw and all of a sudden I saw (pause) a strange car coming down the hill, no longer green, not bearing the swastika, but a white star.</span> <span id="s758">It was sort of a mud-splattered vehicle but I've never seen a star brighter in my life and two men sort of jumped out, came running towards us and one came toward where I stood.</span> <span id="s759">He was wearing battle gear.</span> <span id="s760">I have to think...you know, his helmet was this mesh over that and he was wearing dark glasses and he spoke to me in German and he said, does anybody here speak German or English, and I said I speak German.</span> <span id="s761">And I felt that I could tell him we are Jewish and didn't know if you would know what the star means or anything, but you know and I uh I was a little afraid to tell him that but I said to him, we are Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s762">And he didn't answer me for quite a while.</span> <span id="s763">And then his own voice sort of betrayed his own emotions and he said, so am I. I was...it was the greatest hour of my life.</span> <span id="s764">And then he asked an incredible question.</span> <span id="s765">He said, may I see the other ladies?</span> <span id="s766">You know, was we have been addressed for six years and then to hear this man.</span> <span id="s767">He looked to me like a young guard.</span> <span id="s768">I have to tell you I weighted sixty-eight pounds.</span> <span id="s769">My hair was white.</span> <span id="s770">As you can imagine, I hadn't had a bath in years.</span> <span id="s771">And this creature asked for the other ladies.</span> <span id="s772">And I told him that most of the girls were inside, you know.</span> <span id="s773">They were too ill to walk and he said won't you come with me.</span> <span id="s774">And I said sure.</span> <span id="s775">I didn't know what he meant.</span> <span id="s776">He held the door open for me and let me precede him and in that gesture he start me to feel and that young American today is my husband.</span> <span id="s777">(Pause) And that's my story.</span> <span id="s778">(Pause) I was very ill after that.</span> <span id="s779">They established a hospital.</span> <span id="s780">I was in the hospital for quite a while.</span> <span id="s781">I was told I was going to die.</span> <span id="s782">Leisle unfortunately died a few days later of the wounds that she sustained.</span> <span id="s783">I was in the hospital for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s784">He told me...he asked me if he could do something for me, and I said if you could write to my uncle in Turkey and tell him I was alive and see if he had any news about my parents and my brother, and I didn't see him for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s785">You see, the following day the war was over too, and how I found out about it when we went to the...they was making a hospital out of a school house and uh I remember the incredible things.</span> <span id="s786">As a matter of fact, as I just told you, we had a reunion with the Medical Corps of the Division...</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: We're going to have to interrupt.</span> <span id="s788">We have about a minute.</span> <span id="s789">And you've come to liberation.</span> <span id="s790">Tell us in a minute...your liberator was your husband.</span> <span id="s791">Tell us uh...you came to America and you have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, we were married a year later in France.</span> <span id="s793">My husband came back after being uh discharged from the Army.</span> <span id="s794">He came back.</span> <span id="s795">We were married in Paris and I came with him to the United States.</span> <span id="s796">I landed here on the 30th of August, 1946.</span> <span id="s797">Came to Buffalo, New York on the 13th of September.</span> <span id="s798">Have three children and eight grandchildren.</span> <span id="s799">Do I have one minute to make one statement?</span> <span id="s800">I wrote in a preface of my first book something which is very dear to me.</span> <span id="s801">It goes like that.</span> <span id="s802">As I finished the last chapter of my book, I felt at peace at last.</span> <span id="s803">I have discharged a burden and paid a debt to many nameless heros resting in their unmarked graves.</span> <span id="s804">I'm haunted by the thought that I might be the only one left to tell their story.</span> <span id="s805">Happy in my new life, I've had the last sentence of my past.</span> <span id="s806">I've written my story with tears and with love and in the hope that my children, safely asleep in their cribs, should not awaken from a nightmare and find it to be reality.</span> <span id="s807">I have just put my youngest grandchild, three weeks old, to her crib.</span> <span id="s808">It is with this prayer in my heart for all children everywhere...I hope the world will remember all children.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">END OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
