<html><body><p><span id="s1">Interview with Anita Frank [Date not labeled on tape]</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Question: So, I thought maybe we should start with some of those, just a couple things about the war that you didn’t cover too much in the previous interview.</span> <span id="s3">You mentioned that there were a lot of times that you and your brothers, brother and sisters were almost caught.</span> <span id="s4">You told one or two stories but I wonder if there were some other moments that you remember coming close to being caught by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Answer: Well the, the only ones that I’m aware of were when they were going to interview us on the, on the train, when they were, they found the teacher with the Communist books and so on.</span> <span id="s6">That’s the only time that I’m aware of and I’m not sure I mentioned then, I, I, as I said, I’m not sure I remember this then but I, I, we just went back to Holland and for the first time we visited the house where we had been in hiding during the war in Biltoven(ph) and we had, had to move out of that house.</span> <span id="s7">And I can remember a couple of times, not in, when we were in that house but when we moved to I think the third house that we lived in, in Bilthoven(ph), that several times we were told to leave the house because there was, was gonna be a raid on the house and that we had to go into the back yard and go to neighbors and that we had to stay away, until, in effect, we were told to come back.</span> <span id="s8">So, clearly, there was a lot of suspicion that, that the family we stayed with, the Bookas(ph) were hiding children, but, and I’m not sure what they did with our clothes but there were other children there who were not Jewish so, that, they could easily have probably used our things to say those don’t belong, those belong to the children who were clearly not Jewish.</span> <span id="s9">So, anyway, so several times that we had to, to disappear, to avoid the raids and that is, that is something I remembered only later as we visited the third house, actually, we went past it this past April.</span> <span id="s10">But, but what I’ve done is I’ve done some reading since I did that interview about my parents.</span> <span id="s11">My parents have, we asked them to put their memories on videotape, on audiotape.</span> <span id="s12">And they, I, I didn’t realize how very often they came close to being taught, caught, that, that, at least four or five times the police were after them because, because my grandfather lived with them and, and his story was that he was from Switzerland but he didn’t have his papers and other papers didn’t come on time and then my father didn’t have a job so any of those situations aroused the suspicion of the police.</span> <span id="s13">And at one point, actually, my mother, it was a guy named Pete, Pete who worked in Falkenburg where, where my parents were in hiding, came to visit them and, and, and interrogated them.</span> <span id="s14">And my mother basically said to him, “Pete, do not ask any more questions, because you don’t want to know.”</span> <span id="s15">And Pete, who was not a Nazi and not a traitor, said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s16">So, it, it was times like that or, another time when in effect they were told that unless the papers came, were available they would be taken to, to police headquarters and they frantically tried to contact the man who had Mr. Frompinksteron(ph), who, who in effect had provided us with the false papers.</span> <span id="s17">And, and how my father, he couldn’t telephone of course, from the town, he had to walk about ten or fifteen kilometers to a, to a place to make telephone calls so he wouldn’t be traced.</span> <span id="s18">Situations like that, that I, we weren’t aware of because we weren’t with them but it, they happened many a time because my parents also lived out in the open like we did.</span> <span id="s19">That in a way they were continually exposed to danger and that’s why they had the razor blades.</span> <span id="s20">They had their razor blades handy and miraculously we encountered, we encountered, they encountered police that were not with the, with the NS Bay,(ph) which was the Dutch Nazi Party.</span> <span id="s21">At least four, five times, so, it was tenuous.</span> <span id="s22">And, and the reasons they had the raids, they didn’t want to betray us.</span> <span id="s23">They did not.</span> <span id="s24">They hoped that if they were caught, at least that we children would be safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And the Dutch, just before this interview when we were talking for a couple minutes, you mentioned that it was a small percentage of the Dutch who, who actually didn’t betray Jews.</span> <span id="s26">Can you talk a little bit more about, I mean, obviously that’s how you survived, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Was because we were not betrayed.</span> <span id="s28">I need to stress, I, what, what my sense about Holland during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in retrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that many who actively tried to help Jews if, I’m not sure there were that many, who were, who risked their own lives.</span> <span id="s29">And they were truly the noble, the very noble people, because it’s hard to ask people to do that for others.</span> <span id="s30">So, about five percent perhaps that, I’m not even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something.</span> <span id="s31">My feeling is that 80 percent didn’t care.</span> <span id="s32">I’m not saying that they would have betrayed but also that they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s33">But we had a significant, I would say fifty to twenty percent who were traitors.</span> <span id="s34">A huge percentage that were part of the, they belonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who actively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews.</span> <span id="s35">Most Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding.</span> <span id="s36">I think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed.</span> <span id="s37">That’s a significant number.</span> <span id="s38">Probably mostly by the Dutch.</span> <span id="s39">Dutch people who got a few dollars for it, a few guilders which the Dutch thing.</span> <span id="s40">They got guilders so each person had a, had a monetary value attached.</span> <span id="s41">And Holland only now is coming to terms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, I hate to say this, they were not all that different from the German people in that a lot of them just turned their heads.</span> <span id="s42">Most just turned their heads, let it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did you ever talk to Betty Booka(ph) about this, later?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What were her thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, she was truly one of the extraordinary heroines, a remarkable woman who, because of her background, the Quaker background, she was British, one of the Cadbury(ph) families.</span> <span id="s47">She couldn’t tolerate what was happening.</span> <span id="s48">From the very beginning, she couldn’t tolerate this kind of injustice and absolutely, absolutely made it part of her, her life, her commitment to save as many as she could.</span> <span id="s49">And this was who she was.</span> <span id="s50">This was her, her mission in life and that’s what I gather, was true for most of the rescuers.</span> <span id="s51">They saw something happening that was so intolerable to them that, that they could not live with themselves and let this, let this happen to others.</span> <span id="s52">And they, they, they basically did what they, they did what they did because they couldn’t do anything else.</span> <span id="s53">Those are the rescuers.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: How many people did she save, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Oh, she, tens I would say because, I didn’t realize there were other Jewish children in the house, course we didn’t know that there were.</span> <span id="s56">But there were others, she hid other Jews and helped others to hide others and there was a whole system the __________ she and her husband Case(ph) created.</span> <span id="s57">They, they.</span> <span id="s58">there was a group of Jewish children living close by that they took care of and tried to save.</span> <span id="s59">So they, throughout the war, went out of their way to, to save, to save Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: And could have died themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact, one of the terrifying stories was that, there was a, an act of sabotage.</span> <span id="s62">Some, some underground, members of the underground blew up a, a train with Nazi munitions and they, they took Case Booka(ph), in to, to the prison and they said, “unless those who had planned this act, this sabotage and who had done it, that, that Case Booka(ph) would be shot.</span> <span id="s63">And one of the, one of the, one of the perpetrators of this, of blowing up, who blew up the train was a young Jewish man.</span> <span id="s64">And he gave himself up.</span> <span id="s65">He did not want Case(ph) to be killed.</span> <span id="s66">And he was immediately tortured and shot, this young man.</span> <span id="s67">And he was part of the, he was in the Underground but he was Jewish, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: In 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: My God.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s72">Oh yeah, they endangered themselves, the Bookas(ph) endangered, anybody who hid Jews endangered themselves.</span> <span id="s73">And the family, it was interesting cause I just spent, as I said, we were in Holland in April, just, just a few months ago and I spent quite a bit of time with the daughters, three of the daughters of the Booka family.</span> <span id="s74">And I asked them if they knew we were Jewish and you know what?</span> <span id="s75">They really didn’t.</span> <span id="s76">They, it wasn’t discussed, it was never discussed.</span> <span id="s77">They just knew that they, that they had to help hide people.</span> <span id="s78">But it was all, it was all hidden and it was just part of their, of their ethic that they would not cooperate and collaborate with the Nazis and they would do what they could to help those in need.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Do you think Betty and Case(ph) didn’t tell them just, to not give them information that they might betray by mistake?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Right.</span> <span id="s81">Not to implicate.</span> <span id="s82">Right.</span> <span id="s83">And it was Betty by the way, it was, in retrospect, it was Betty who insisted doing this, not Case(ph).</span> <span id="s84">I don’t know, we’re not even sure Case(ph) knew we were Jewish, because they took in other children.</span> <span id="s85">It was Betty who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What kind of woman was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Extraordinary, a gentle, little, beautiful, sweetest face in the world, kind, caring, concerned, loving, extraordinary woman who, who just, she couldn’t do anything different.</span> <span id="s88">And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she came to visit us and whenever we went back to Holland, of course, we visited her until she died.</span> <span id="s89">And, and the interesting thing about her is, she was so concerned about others that in some way, she neglected her own children.</span> <span id="s90">She had eight children, they had eight children themselves and, and that, you see that often in those who are truly committed to the well-being of others that, very often, there is some, you, you sort of assume your own children will manage.</span> <span id="s91">So I think, I, I think there’s some bitterness there now, among her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You sense that when you talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s94">Yeah, they admired her, they loved her very much but I still have a real sense that they themselves did not probably, did not get what they needed because Betty was so concerned for, for others.</span> <span id="s95">You only have so much energy.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did you ever see her show emotion during the war over the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No.</span> <span id="s98">No, because basically we were told never to tell anybody and so, we didn’t except those little lapses.</span> <span id="s99">And I didn’t even know that she knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s100">I can remember, and that was, that was just the whole thing that I was so torn up about.</span> <span id="s101">I mean, we were told never to tell anybody, so as far as we were concerned, we were non-Jewish children living with these people and I had no idea who knew and who didn’t know.</span> <span id="s102">So I couldn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s103">So it was that, that horrendous fear of being discovered that stayed with me and the inability to talk to anybody about it, for two years.</span> <span id="s104">So all I knew was that we had to be there because we’d be killed but I did not know that Betty knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s105">It turned out she did but really, most others didn’t, in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Have you seen any of the other children who stayed in that house at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No.</span> <span id="s108">Yeah, well no, that’s not true, where, as a matter of fact yes we did, I did, just in, in April.</span> <span id="s109">Eric, Eric State(ph) was there, the whole time we were there, my brother and I were there.</span> <span id="s110">Eric lived there and Eric has, he had a, I don’t know, I think he had a serious illness and so he’s, he’s, almost a form of autism and he’s now, so we saw him, I saw him for the first in 50 years.</span> <span id="s111">We visited him in his, in his apartment.</span> <span id="s112">In Julia,(ph), no it was Kondia Booka(ph) and I went to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: But your brother went with you to Holland?</span> <span id="s114">Who, who did you say went with you?</span> <span id="s115">Or did you go with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Oh with my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, no, my brother tragically just died.</span> <span id="s119">My, the, my brother with whom I was in hiding, Norman, just died April, May 28th, May 29th of pancreatic cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yeah, yeah, that was very sad and that was the terrifying thing of going to Europe and knowing, not knowing whether he would live.</span> <span id="s122">He didn’t, he did live until we returned and we were able to be with him but now he tragically died.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Oh boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: You said that your, your father said your mother’s couraged, courage saved the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Can you elaborate on that please?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: It was my mother, my father admitted that he was in total despair at times and that when they were in hiding in Falkenburg, well in the first place, she saved my father’s life by taking the, I talked about that on the tape, taking the Cross of Merit to the, that her father had earned in World War I to the German commander of our town.</span> <span id="s129">And who in effect excused my father from that transport where they took first, they first took the men to, totally debilitate the families.</span> <span id="s130">And so she did that and then my father said many times that during the war, when in effect the, the police would come and when in effect they were told to produce papers that they couldn’t produce, and when in effect these threats were made of transporting us, of, of interrogating us on the train because they notified my parents this might happen, that my father said she, he would just be in despair and my mother just would support him and encourage him and say, “No, let’s, let’s go and see what we can do and let’s contact Frompinksteron(ph) but be careful about it,” and she just, she just, she just is the one who, who persevered.</span> <span id="s131">She’s the one who said to Pete, this policeman, “Pete, you don’t want to know these questions, don’t ask us.”</span> <span id="s132">I mean, she would come up, it’s almost like her intuition allowed her to do the right things at the right time.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Because that was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Exceedingly dangerous.</span> <span id="s135">It would have been the end of it again.</span> <span id="s136">I, had he been with the Nazi, the NS Bay(ph), that would have been the end of the family.</span> <span id="s137">But she took risks, somehow almost intuitively knowing what was to, at the same time, she didn’t want him to continue asking because she did not want him to know this information.</span> <span id="s138">So it was just amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: I wonder what, how he answered to his superiors when he didn’t get ...</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: He said things are fine, probably.</span> <span id="s141">Probably went back and said things are okay, and looked at the papers and things are okay.</span> <span id="s142">He covered up for them, whoever this Pete was.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: But then after the war, my mother suffered horrendously.</span> <span id="s145">She never recovered.</span> <span id="s146">Then she had her nervous breakdowns and then she turned from really this, this very positive, I gathered from my cousin who still lives in Holland who adored, who lived a year with my parents before the war, who, she just said my mother was the most loving and positive and, and, and affectionate woman.</span> <span id="s147">But after the war, she just, that was all.</span> <span id="s148">I can’t say it was all lost, she remained very caring but she became so bitter and so unhappy and so distraught, so desperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Well, your family had a very difficult time in those early years right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Economically, housing ...</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: What were, besides the British censorship job, what were some of the other jobs your father did?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, he didn’t, I think that was his first job.</span> <span id="s155">We came, we were liberated in, in September, September 17th, ’44, in Lindbergh,(ph), in Howtem(ph), we stayed and then we moved to, we moved to a house where the, where the, traitor’s house where he was in prison and the woman was forced to take us in.</span> <span id="s156">Then in April of ’40, ’45, just before, just before the end of World War II in, in Holland which was May, I think it was May five, May 5th, when Holland was liberated.</span> <span id="s157">In April we went to, back to ________ and we lived in this bombed-out house and his first job there was with English censorship so my mother was left alone with us.</span> <span id="s158">And then he came back from that and then he went back to the Ferda(ph) which was the, the clothing factory with whom he’d worked before the war so he went back to them and then, after that, he left them and went to another clothing, worked for another clothing manufacturers, as a representative.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: A salesman?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: A salesman, yeah.</span> <span id="s161">They called them factory representatives.</span> <span id="s162">He would go to stores and, and, and, yeah, sell their, their line of clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Which probably, or was that a difficult job after the war given the, the economy of the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah, it was very hard but he had some old customers who when they, who had, as a matter of fact one of his customers was very helpful to us during the war.</span> <span id="s165">They hid some of my parents’ silver and they lived in Lindbergh(ph), northern Lindbergh(ph), and Findlow(ph), and they were, they were very helpful to my parents.</span> <span id="s166">So when my, my father again took that job, they, I think they bought from him.</span> <span id="s167">He was a lousy salesman.</span> <span id="s168">He, he should never have been into sales.</span> <span id="s169">But it was his whole family’s business but my father was an intellectual and he should never have been a salesperson.</span> <span id="s170">He was, hated that, wasn’t good at it, totally honest, totally ethical, totally non-pushy, totally not the characteristics of somebody who’s going to make it big in sales, exact opposite.</span> <span id="s171">Oh, I’m probably insulting salespeople now.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: So, in other words, those first few years, economically your family was, would you describe it as on the edge?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Oh, we were continually on the edge.</span> <span id="s174">I mean, we came back with nothing.</span> <span id="s175">Our, my, my mother, because she came from a very wealthy family had, had, we’d lived in this house and my mother had all these gorgeous things which were all mostly taken away, also by Dutch people who didn’t return them to us after the war.</span> <span id="s176">“After all,” they said, “you gave them to us.”</span> <span id="s177">And so, like my parents knew who had taken the, the bedroom set, which was a gorgeous bedroom set, people absolutely refused to return these things to us.</span> <span id="s178">It’s hard to believe that Dutch people, _______ support from what they called the __________ Commission or something like that so we got a little bit of money but that was not until I think a year afterwards which allowed my parents to buy some furniture.</span> <span id="s179">We never got any reparation, we were never got a penny for what happened to us during the war.</span> <span id="s180">Not from the Nazis, not from the, not from the Germans, we call them Nazis, not from the Germans, not from the Dutch government, except a, a little bit that allowed my parents to buy some furniture.</span> <span id="s181">And, and the reason we survived the war was not because my parents had any money but my, my aunt and uncle in, in Ossin(ph), my father’s sister and her husband who had been very close to my parents.</span> <span id="s182">They made money available to us and their two daughters survived the war.</span> <span id="s183">One is the, and one tragically killed herself after the war.</span> <span id="s184">Another, another consequence of the war.</span> <span id="s185">And, and, and, they in effect allowed my parents to survive because my parents did have to pay for us.</span> <span id="s186">Not much, but they paid the Bookas(ph), I saw the, I saw the records, they paid the Bookas(ph) to have us stay there.</span> <span id="s187">And of course they had to live themselves.</span> <span id="s188">But that was made possible because my aunt and uncle who tragically were taken out of, they were both very ill and taken out of the hospital and put in cattle cars and died before they got to, to Poland.</span> <span id="s189">And that, and so that money was gone by the end of the war and it was, it was very rough financially, there was no money until my father sort of got back into selling some stuff and so we lived carefully.</span> <span id="s190">And, and then when he got his new job, he did okay, he did, actually remember one year we actually made enough on commissions that we had a little bit of extra which allowed me to go to Paris, in 1940.</span> <span id="s191">I was fifteen so that must have been 1951, before we came to America.</span> <span id="s192">One of the soldiers who had been in the Liberation Army in Lindbergh(ph), a wonderful young man, Jewish, and we had stayed in touch with him and he’d gone back to America, married a journalist.</span> <span id="s193">And they went to Paris.</span> <span id="s194">They, and they lived in Paris and invited one of us, and as the oldest girl I had privilege, to come and spend six weeks in Paris.</span> <span id="s195">And I remember, finally, my parents having little bit of extra money they could afford the train fare to, to Paris.</span> <span id="s196">It was a big adventure and it was the same summer they were able to rent a, a cabin on the beach.</span> <span id="s197">So I remember there was the one summer that we had a little bit of money.</span> <span id="s198">But for the rest, it was, it was minimal.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Do you remember the food that you ate before the war, during the war, and right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Not before the war.</span> <span id="s201">It was good food.</span> <span id="s202">My mother was, she had some help and my aunt, my mother’s only sister, they had gotten her out of Germany in 1936 so she lived with us for awhile and my parents, and my mother’s parents lived with us.</span> <span id="s203">So I think my mother’s mother did much of the cooking until she died in 1938.</span> <span id="s204">But it was the Dutch eat potatoes and the, the staples really were bread and potatoes and a little bit of meat, porridge, food like that, vegetables.</span> <span id="s205">But meat was very expensive.</span> <span id="s206">Eggs were very expensive so you didn’t have much of that so it was mostly the carbohydrates.</span> <span id="s207">And then during the war, I remember very clearly getting minute portions of butter, it was margarine, just like perhaps two tablespoons of butter, that, the margarine had to last us the whole week.</span> <span id="s208">So, I, I, what I remember were the, the extreme small rations we had and how you had to just be so careful that you just took a little bit and put that on your bread.</span> <span id="s209">And, and again, mostly what we ate were bread, potatoes.</span> <span id="s210">That, that was most of our staples.</span> <span id="s211">It was, I think severe vitamin I think we lacked, had severe vitamin deficiency.</span> <span id="s212">Not, probably not protein, not, protein yes but not calorie deficiency but certainly vitamin deficiencies which manifested itself in me when I was in 1943, we went to visit our parents for Christmas.</span> <span id="s213">It was the first time we went to see them and we were hit by a sleigh.</span> <span id="s214">We were watching people coming down the hill and we were hit by a sleigh and it made a huge gash in my leg and it got horrendously infected and that infection lasts from Christmas to Easter.</span> <span id="s215">And I remember Betty taking me to the doctor every week.</span> <span id="s216">I just had sores all over my legs and I just didn’t heal.</span> <span id="s217">And I think that had to do with, just deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies, more susceptible to illness.</span> <span id="s218">And then after the war, there were severe shortages again so really the whole time that I was in Holland until ’52, things were rationed.</span> <span id="s219">I can remember seeing my first orange, getting it from the Americans, as first orange.</span> <span id="s220">Seeing my first pineapple in 1949 or so, in a store which was just sort of put there prominently and I not knowing what a pineapple was, so very simple foods after the war when, after things became, Holland was in horrendous shape because of the war.</span> <span id="s221">And it took a long time and that’s where the Marshall Plan was so incredibly helpful.</span> <span id="s222">It took a long time for the economies of Europe to begin to recover from the horrors.</span> <span id="s223">And I can remember, we would have meat once a week.</span> <span id="s224">And we’d have one chicken which we’d divide and we’d get just a little piece and we’d have an egg if we were lucky once a week.</span> <span id="s225">We would have cheese though, cheese and jams, those things were our favorite.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Do you think your gaining a bit of weight in California later at all was a compensation for that lack of food?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Hadn’t thought about that.</span> <span id="s228">Yeah.</span> <span id="s229">You live with shortages and then all of a sudden this, [talkover] unending supply of food.</span> <span id="s230">Yeah, it became my, my salvation.</span> <span id="s231">Some salvation.</span> <span id="s232">But that, that’s, that’s very possible, yes.</span> <span id="s233">This, like, eat it now because it may disappear.</span> <span id="s234">Hadn’t thought about that to be honest.</span> <span id="s235">I just, I knew it became a crutch for me and it was my antidepressant but it became like food was something I could fill my empty soul with.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And all those years of lack.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s238">Yeah, makes, it makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: See, maybe I should have been a counselor.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Just kidding.</span> <span id="s242">Let me see what else I have on the war.</span> <span id="s243">Time.</span> <span id="s244">I wondered if after the war you had any recurring dreams or nightmares?</span> <span id="s245">Or during?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I don’t remember about the dreams and nightmares.</span> <span id="s247">What I do remember were feelings of I will never leave my parents, meaning I couldn’t imagine that I would ever marry and want to leave my parents, that they represented my safety, my base, my solidity, my comfort.</span> <span id="s248">And that I had a very strong sense that, that, that they, that they represented all that was good for me.</span> <span id="s249">And, and I think that had to do with not having had them during the war, not being with them.</span> <span id="s250">I remember being, of course, horrendously ashamed and I’ve talked about that, I think.</span> <span id="s251">[End of side 1 of tape 1].</span> <span id="s252">Okay, so these, these, the feelings and that, that, so that involved fear and also it was because during the war, I, I had this real sense that I had to be perfect, that I couldn’t make any mistakes, that I couldn’t do anything wrong, I mean that was, as long as I just stayed perfect, that wouldn’t, I wouldn’t be killed.</span> <span id="s253">I mean, I wouldn’t betray myself, or even more so, as long as I stayed perfect, nobody would betray me to the Germans, nobody would think I was a bad person and, and betray me to the Germans.</span> <span id="s254">And that sense of having to be this perfect child became part of who I, who I, I was after the war.</span> <span id="s255">And it meant that I couldn’t assert myself.</span> <span id="s256">I was afraid of, I was afraid of asserting myself.</span> <span id="s257">And I remember having a feeling of, crazy, that I saw other children doing, doing bad, quote, bad things, not terribly bad but being disobedient or being rude and I can remember thinking, and I was about 11 years old.</span> <span id="s258">I can remember thinking, why can’t I be like that?</span> <span id="s259">Why can’t I be a little bit bad?</span> <span id="s260">So, so, clearly, there was, there remained an overriding fear in me that I had to be, I had to be good, I had to be perfect, otherwise something bad was going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s261">But there was also something in me already that said why can’t I be like other children?</span> <span id="s262">And, and that, that need to please others, that need not to disagree with others stayed with me.</span> <span id="s263">And then, I remember one occasion.</span> <span id="s264">We were playing ball on the street.</span> <span id="s265">Tennis balls, we had tennis balls.</span> <span id="s266">And a woman was riding her bicycle and she, she hit one of the balls and she fell and she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s267">And she, she ripped her stockings.</span> <span id="s268">And I can remember, she came and she was really angry at us and I can remember saying to her, “Well, you should have looked out,” or something like that.</span> <span id="s269">I was being rude and it was like, it was almost like something in me said, now is your opportunity to be rude and it was most inappropriate really.</span> <span id="s270">I mean I chose the wrong person and then, but she came into our house.</span> <span id="s271">My mother was very felt, was very apologetic and paid for new stockings and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s272">And thank heavens the baby wasn’t harmed.</span> <span id="s273">But, but I can remember that was my one moment of rudeness.</span> <span id="s274">But the way, the way this came out was, and I mentioned that, was that I became immobilized in school.</span> <span id="s275">I stopped learning.</span> <span id="s276">It was just like something in me got just so blocked is, the ability to be who I really was.</span> <span id="s277">And I’m not saying I’m a a bad person or I wanted to be rude, but I, this, this sort of need to, to, to speak up for what you think or what you want didn’t have, I, I just couldn’t do that so that sort of came out then in school where I just became emotionally, just horrendously blocked.</span> <span id="s278">I couldn’t, couldn’t study, couldn’t work and there, not being this perfect person, not being this top student which I always have been, I, I, that was just something I had no control over, I felt, so, I, I felt very bad about it because I knew I disappointed my father because he had such high expectations of me.</span> <span id="s279">But at least I felt I had no control over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: For a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: For a long time, yeah.</span> <span id="s282">For a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: You mentioned that a key turning point was making the friendship with Elizabeth Dixon(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Are you still friends with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, I’m sadly enough not.</span> <span id="s287">She, we had a, so we were great friends until I married my husband and then she went through a very difficult time.</span> <span id="s288">She got divorced and I’m afraid that, of, I went to go and visit her one day and, well, I don’t particularly want to tell the story.</span> <span id="s289">But very unfortunate things where she got furious with me for not having notified her.</span> <span id="s290">I did, I wrote, I called her, I wrote her.</span> <span id="s291">She said to me come anytime you want to.</span> <span id="s292">I took her at her word.</span> <span id="s293">I sent her a card from, from New Hampshire where we were then, saying we’ll be there on that day, and we got to the house and she had tickets to the ballet or something.</span> <span id="s294">And wrote me this furious letter about how inconsiderate I was and thoughtless I was.</span> <span id="s295">And I, I’m afraid that this, she, because of her own miseries, she projected a whole bunch of her anger of me and I had been sort of the good little girl.</span> <span id="s296">I mean, I was the one who just adored her and admired her and, and just thought a world of her and then when I married, I became this independent woman and no longer this adoring creature who needed her as much.</span> <span id="s297">And I think that type of role, I mean, I may be analyzing it too much.</span> <span id="s298">But it was very tragic, this soon after a marry, this, after I was married, I just, our relationship changed.</span> <span id="s299">And it ended, sadly enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: And yet you said the friendship was key for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: It, what was key was that after, after coming to America and having my ego totally destroyed, I feel, no, that’s nonsense.</span> <span id="s302">Having my ego severely damaged even further by Henry Coster(ph) who, I, I think I told that story where, basically he, when I, when I was promised I could go to the opening of the rope(ph) and then was told to stay home with Peter because he was sick and, I, I dared, here, for the first time, I dared complain.</span> <span id="s303">I dared express some of my needs and that was literally the first time I’d done that.</span> <span id="s304">Since, since the war because I had been so careful, I have no needs.</span> <span id="s305">I just, I just managed, I just coped.</span> <span id="s306">I had no needs.</span> <span id="s307">So there, I, first time that I remember basically going to Peggy Coster(ph) and saying, “I’m really sad, I really, I really had been looking forward to this and I’m really unhappy.”</span> <span id="s308">And then Peggy telling Henry Coster(ph) that I had complained and Henry Coster(ph) calling me in and telling me I had no right to do that.</span> <span id="s309">That devastated me.</span> <span id="s310">That absolutely confirmed the fact that I had no right.</span> <span id="s311">I had no right to complain.</span> <span id="s312">I had no right to express my feelings or express my needs and it, that stayed with me for years and years and years and make me feel I had no value.</span> <span id="s313">Until I went to the Soviet Union and with, and Elizabeth Dixon(ph) was there on the second exhibit, no it was the first exhibit, and where in effect she seemed to really like me.</span> <span id="s314">And she was lonely there and she was a real friend to me and I, she provided me with a home and I remember very distinctly thinking she is a person of value.</span> <span id="s315">She values me so there must be some value to me.</span> <span id="s316">I, I absolutely went through those thought processes.</span> <span id="s317">And then that, that was enormous boost to me, that she’d really cared about me, the first person in this country to really do so.</span> <span id="s318">And that was a long time after I’d been here, that was in 1962.</span> <span id="s319">That was ten years, ten years after I’d come to this country, that, that’s, that’s when I really began to feel there had to be something worthwhile in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: How do you view Henry Coster(ph) now in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well, again, I’m intensely grateful to him because he was our sponsor and he made it possible for us to come to this country.</span> <span id="s322">And coming to this country, notwithstanding the miserable first ten years, was liberation, was, was our, was for me true liberation.</span> <span id="s323">Because eventually allowed me to come, become the person who I am today.</span> <span id="s324">Tragically, he, so there I’m very grateful to him.</span> <span id="s325">But tragically, he was, he’s part of this Hollywood garbage dump.</span> <span id="s326">And, and what a fake life those people lead.</span> <span id="s327">Nothing is real, nothing is authentic.</span> <span id="s328">I’m exaggerating as usual.</span> <span id="s329">But very little is authentic and, and, even, naïve and innocent as I was when I came to California, living in this fake environment, even I knew that these people weren’t real.</span> <span id="s330">Even I knew that these expressions of interest meant nothing.</span> <span id="s331">And so he, he did not, and I’m not blaming him, but he clearly and neither did Peggy, I think, Peggy is a, was a sweet, she was always very sweet, I need to stress that.</span> <span id="s332">But, but Henry ruled the roost.</span> <span id="s333">And I don’t think he had any sense of what was going on with me at all.</span> <span id="s334">And I don’t know whether I can blame him for that or not.</span> <span id="s335">I don’t blame because I don’t hold him, he did what he knew how.</span> <span id="s336">But you know, you live, you grow up in that world of fakery and you grow up in that, you live in that world where all these people play pretend and so little is real and people don’t even know what is real and what is not real.</span> <span id="s337">And I gather there now, there’s a group now, stars that may have a somewhat stronger grip on reality.</span> <span id="s338">But in those days, it was just about as fake as you could imagine.</span> <span id="s339">Yeah, I don’t think he knew any better, so, I, I prefer to look at him and say thank you for bringing us to America.</span> <span id="s340">I, I like not, I don’t, I don’t focus on the bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: But no, no one in that family ever asked you about your wartime experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No.</span> <span id="s343">Never.</span> <span id="s344">That’s, that’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s345">We lived, it was like secrets.</span> <span id="s346">It was like, it was like, that was, I think, the horror of, of the war years.</span> <span id="s347">It wasn’t just the war years, it was afterwards when quote, nothing had happened.</span> <span id="s348">It was as if we had to, we had to continue our whole lifestyle as if nothing had happened.</span> <span id="s349">As if we had just had this normal kind of life.</span> <span id="s350">And so that’s what we believed, that we just had to go on as if nothing had happened to us.</span> <span id="s351">And so we couldn’t ever get in touch with the horrors of the war and we couldn’t even, we, we couldn’t even, sort of begin to think about it and say hey, how did this impact us?</span> <span id="s352">Because it was never talked about, it was never discussed.</span> <span id="s353">In contrary, on the contrary, we just had to go on and we had to be good, good kids and we hadn’t, shouldn’t cause anybody any problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Have you maintained any contact with his children since you left the babysitting job?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Well, yes, as a matter of fact, Peter the younger son, Nicky, Nicky tragically died.</span> <span id="s356">He was a psychiatrist and died of, under very unfortunate circumstances.</span> <span id="s357">And Peter and his mother Peggy were here a year and a half ago, almost two years ago.</span> <span id="s358">They, they came to visit for the first time, the first time I’d seen Peter.</span> <span id="s359">Henry Coster(ph) died in, about ten years ago.</span> <span id="s360">But Peggy was, was very nice to see her and Peter came with his wife.</span> <span id="s361">So we had a lovely, lovely reunion here.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Did you guys talk at all about, was she surprised, for instance to see how much you changed and grown and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yeah, I think so, escept(ph) what was so amazing is my parents had four children, and Henry Coster(ph) had two children is really, that given our circumstances, is how well the four of us had done.</span> <span id="s364">And that yeah, that, this little fat girl that stayed with them for year and a half had sort of turned into rather competent human being and, I think they were.</span> <span id="s365">But you know what, I could not talk to them about my real experiences there.</span> <span id="s366">I could, I did not feel that I could say to them, do you know what happened to me?</span> <span id="s367">And so it, it remained superficial.</span> <span id="s368">The discussion wasn’t a real, sort of recognition of what had happened those, that year and a half I stayed with them it was.</span> <span id="s369">Talking about people we knew and things we’d done and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Well, then, they would have to accept some responsibility for not being more sympathetic and understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s372">And I didn’t, I didn’t, I didn’t want to bring this up now.</span> <span id="s373">Peter, of course, had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s374">I always adored Peter so Peter was just six, bless his little heart and he was a marvelous child.</span> <span id="s375">So it was, it was with Peggy, and I just didn’t want to do that because I don’t think she would have understood.</span> <span id="s376">I don’t think she would have understood.</span> <span id="s377">And that’s too, when you have just one day together, you don’t want to, one evening together, you don’t want to bring up those issues.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: At least I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Well, also, there’s that, that balance thing where they also sponsored you and gave you this opportunity ...</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s382">For which, in the long run, I mean, I have recovered from that.</span> <span id="s383">For totally, for sure, in spades as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s384">And, and in, indeed, I am unbelievable grateful that they made it possible for us to come to this country.</span> <span id="s385">So, that’s, that’s more important to me than the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Did you ever find out more about how your father and Henry Coster(ph) became friends in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: No.</span> <span id="s388">Really, all I know is that they had my, they had a friend called, a woman named Tanta Onna Headsfeld(ph), I think her name was.</span> <span id="s389">And they met through her and she was my mother’s sister’s mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s390">‘Kay, so, my mother’s, my mother had a sister, Tanta Powla(ph), it was her husband’s mother who was the one who brought my father and Henry Coster(ph) together.</span> <span id="s391">And all I know was that was in the twenties and my father was traveling in Germany and the Dutch economy’s doing well, reasonably well, that the German economy was disastrous and my father helped Henry Coster(ph).</span> <span id="s392">And they were pretty good friends but again, it was really sad because after, when we came to America and when my parents moved to California in 1958, we, in ’52 we went to St. Louis and ’58 they moved to California.</span> <span id="s393">Henry, really, had nothing to do, they, they really, perhaps saw my parents once every two years.</span> <span id="s394">But there was no effort at really having a relationship with my father.</span> <span id="s395">Because he was, he was a hotshot director and my father was a lowly, __________, let’s see in California he ran, he managed a motel.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: What was that like for your parents to come to America and have to take minimum wage jobs and basically start all over once again?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: That’s, I’ve thought about that a lot.</span> <span id="s398">Again, they never had an opportunity to talk about anything so they, like the rest of us, they just did what was expected of them.</span> <span id="s399">And they came to America for us and so my father, my mother who had never worked outside the house, took these job, first job was in a handbag, handbag factory.</span> <span id="s400">My father worked in a paint factory, got horrendous paint, lead poisoning there, practically died.</span> <span id="s401">They never did anything for him there.</span> <span id="s402">They had, cheap(ph) job as custodians, I mean, they had these, my mother worked as a nurse’s aide in a hospital.</span> <span id="s403">Horrible jobs.</span> <span id="s404">Horrible jobs.</span> <span id="s405">Never complained.</span> <span id="s406">Never complained.</span> <span id="s407">Never even regretted having left Holland because even though that, it must have been just so hard for them to totally shift focus.</span> <span id="s408">They did it.</span> <span id="s409">They were totally remarkable and, and what, they did it for us.</span> <span id="s410">And they, I think all of us, perhaps all of us felt a strong obligation to our parents.</span> <span id="s411">That was never ever lost throughout that lifetime that, that we, we also made sure that when we became adults and we were capable, we took care of them.</span> <span id="s412">So they never, I bought ‘em a house in Washington, after they, my father retired from the motel.</span> <span id="s413">I lived in Washington.</span> <span id="s414">They came to Washington.</span> <span id="s415">My sister and I bought ‘em a house and then I supported ‘em in the house.</span> <span id="s416">And they lived in that house in, in Rockville, Maryland.</span> <span id="s417">Nice little house for about, until from 1965 until 1971, I think.</span> <span id="s418">And then my sister came with her husband.</span> <span id="s419">They, she had been in the Air Force in Thailand, and then they moved my parents, lock, stock and barrel to, to Florida.</span> <span id="s420">And then they lived with my sister there for 20 years.</span> <span id="s421">And then after my father died, my mother came and lived with my other sister in Baltimore and her last eight months, she lived with me.</span> <span id="s422">That we, I just could not tolerate sending, she was, she had mild dementia, she’d broken hips and she was crippled and I, we could never have put her in a home.</span> <span id="s423">I, I, and she died.</span> <span id="s424">Both my parents died at home, thank God.</span> <span id="s425">So they were never abandoned.</span> <span id="s426">We never abandoned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: How old were they when they died?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: My, both, both 90.</span> <span id="s429">My father was 90 when he died of a, of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s430">My mother was 90 when she, basically she, she had TIAs, transeedischemic(ph) attacks and just these little strokes and, and just mentally was confused but she lived with me and then in, in July she had a stroke which left her paraplegic.</span> <span id="s431">And then she died in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Did your family speak English while you lived in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: My father did.</span> <span id="s434">My father spoke three languages fluently.</span> <span id="s435">I studied English in Holland and, it was a, I still don’t know I did it, studied just for two years, came to America, went to Beverly Hills, California and started school.</span> <span id="s436">We came to, we arrived in America December 7.</span> <span id="s437">I went to California about December 16th and started school January and I took finals end of January in public speaking and English and I did better than a whole bunch of the kids who’d been in class.</span> <span id="s438">I learned English just, just in no time.</span> <span id="s439">Just, I still don’t know how I did it but I was pretty fluent in English in a very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: What about the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Not as quickly.</span> <span id="s442">My, my mother had the hardest time.</span> <span id="s443">My younger sisters learned it in school.</span> <span id="s444">When you’re young, it’s easy to learn another language.</span> <span id="s445">My father spoke it.</span> <span id="s446">My mother had the hardest time learning English but bless her heart, she did.</span> <span id="s447">Unlike a lot of foreigners who just never learn, she did.</span> <span id="s448">So we ended up all, in a way that was sad, we all ended up speaking English to each other, instead of Dutch.</span> <span id="s449">But I’ve, I’ve kept my Dutch up.</span> <span id="s450">I, I can still speak it.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Did your mother also read English?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s453">Oh yes, oh, devout reader of the paper.</span> <span id="s454">Every morning she’d read the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: How do you think your parents worked on their recovery?</span> <span id="s456">Did you say that they didn’t really recover say as fully as you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: My mother never recovered.</span> <span id="s458">As a matter of fact, one of the great horrors to, to think about how, how you can never forget, is because you never forget, is that as she became, as she became more demented, I hate that word, as she began to lose her memory more, the past started coming back and she became terrified that the, that the Gestapo was around.</span> <span id="s459">When she was my sister she said, “Who are these people outside?</span> <span id="s460">Are they, is that the Gestapo?</span> <span id="s461">Close the windows, don’t let ‘em see us.”</span> <span id="s462">When, when she was me, I start crying every time I think about that, is that she, at one point, she was sitting at the table and she said, “Anita,” she said, “Did my sister die a natural death?”</span> <span id="s463">I know, her sister died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s464">And I said yes she did.</span> <span id="s465">I mean,I wasn’t about to say to her, no she died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s466">But, and then, and then when friends came to visit and they were very lovely to her, after they left she said, “Do they know we’re Jewish?”</span> <span id="s467">So she was back, she was back.</span> <span id="s468">And then she would sit in the chair and she’d say, “I want to go home.”</span> <span id="s469">And I said, “Where do you want to go?”</span> <span id="s470">And she was thinking, she want to go home to her parents.</span> <span id="s471">That’s, that’s, and I said, “I’m afraid, I’m afraid that your parents aren’t here anymore.”</span> <span id="s472">And she’d say, “Oh, that’s right, they’re dead.”</span> <span id="s473">But she wanted, she wanted something, I know, I know what she, she wanted to go back to a place where she was safe.</span> <span id="s474">And really after the war I don’t think there was anymore safe place for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: She’d just been through too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Through too much.</span> <span id="s477">And again, no recognition, no, no acknowledgment after the war about what had happened to Jews.</span> <span id="s478">Basically, the message in Holland was to Jews, is come on, why don’t you just forget it, just, just, like this woman I heard on television, why don’t you just go forget it, go on with your life?</span> <span id="s479">And this deliberate effort to, to pretend that what had happened to the Jews was not different from what happened to other Dutch people.</span> <span id="s480">And you got that from the Dutch.</span> <span id="s481">Well, we have suffered too.</span> <span id="s482">Well, they had no concept of the difference between their suffering.</span> <span id="s483">Well, my brother had to hide, yes, my brother had to hide.</span> <span id="s484">They had no concept of the difference between quote their suffering.</span> <span id="s485">And I’m not saying the Dutch didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s486">But I’m also saying that there was no recognition of the difference between what happened to us and what happened to the rest of the Dutch who were not singled out, who suffered as a people, but we were singled out because of who we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Why don’t you tell that story that, about the restaurant in Chicago where the woman was interviewed after the Berlin Wall fell?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s489">Well, again, it’s, it’s, I even heard this from a friend of mine, “Why don’t you just forget it?”</span> <span id="s490">It’s, it’s the kind of thing even though I personally feel that I have done extraordinarily well because I’ve dealt with it for so many years now.</span> <span id="s491">I’ve, I’ve been able to come to terms with happened and recognize how present behaviors are related to the past and made every effort not to allow the past to control my, my present behavior.</span> <span id="s492">But the, the reality is, is that those of us who went through it will never forget.</span> <span id="s493">And so to listen to people telling me that we should just forget it, I, I want to shoot ‘em.</span> <span id="s494">And one of the most striking memories is when the Berlin Wall came down, PBS had a program in which they talked about how wonderful it was to have the wall come down but recognizing that, that some of the Jew survivors, the Holocaust survivors weren’t so happy about the wall coming down, that in effect, that, that there had been several expressions of deep concern about a united Germany and what that meant.</span> <span id="s495">Basically, what it meant to Europe.</span> <span id="s496">And, and the interviewer went to an ethnic restaurant, a German ethnic, in Chicago I think it was and talked to this woman and said, well they were celebrating, they were celebrating the wall coming down.</span> <span id="s497">And this interviewer saying to this woman, “Well, what do you think?</span> <span id="s498">There are some people who are deeply concerned about this wall coming down, about, in terms of what it means for a united Germany?”</span> <span id="s499">And her response was, “Ahh, why can’t they just forget it?”</span> <span id="s500">I wanted to kill her.</span> <span id="s501">I, I, not that I never would, because I can’t but that’s, that was my thought.</span> <span id="s502">You miserable witch.</span> <span id="s503">If I, if I had been there, I, I don’t know what I would have done to her because how can we forget?</span> <span id="s504">Yeah, we survived but our families didn’t, our relatives didn’t.</span> <span id="s505">We had, we came to America and fortunately I have three cousins who survived.</span> <span id="s506">Two who live in California with their families and one who still lives in Holland and that’s it.</span> <span id="s507">And, we had to start from scratch.</span> <span id="s508">I went to a wonderful wedding yesterday with Jewish family, dear wonderful, wonderful friends and they were blessed.</span> <span id="s509">Hundreds, they had a hundred of their relatives there and their families had left Europe, thank God, in the, in the early 1900’s, came to America.</span> <span id="s510">Even though they’d lost distant relatives, they were able to come with their families and build and have this wonderful extended family and how I envy them because they have got, they’ve got the cousins and the aunts and the uncles.</span> <span id="s511">We don’t.</span> <span id="s512">We had to start from scratch.</span> <span id="s513">We’re starting with our little family and I must say, we lost more than most.</span> <span id="s514">We lost most, my father had seven brothers and sisters and only he and the older brother survived with some cousins.</span> <span id="s515">My mother had just one sister and her daughter and they were murdered so, that, that leaves very little family.</span> <span id="s516">And so you come here and you start from scratch.</span> <span id="s517">_________ you start from scratch without your, but you also, you have the memories, you don’t, you don’t forget that.</span> <span id="s518">You live with that.</span> <span id="s519">I, there, rarely a day I don’t think about my, my aunt or my cousins who were murdered.</span> <span id="s520">I just, that’s not something you forget and every thing that reminds you of them makes, and those people who were killed in the concentration camps, those are not strangers, that’s family.</span> <span id="s521">So you don’t forget, you can’t forget and you shouldn’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And is it like when you hear someone being so insensitive, like the woman in the restaurant in Chicago, is it like that person is denying your experience, your suffering, your, your loss?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yeah, yeah, right, that’s, that’s what they do.</span> <span id="s524">It’s, it’s, what kind of assininity is that?</span> <span id="s525">What kind of stupidity is that?</span> <span id="s526">They should go through something like this for them to understand.</span> <span id="s527">And I’m thinking of the horrors of Bosnia.</span> <span id="s528">They’re not gonna forget.</span> <span id="s529">It’s gonna be etched in their minds and their memories and they’re gonna live forever with the loss of their, of their families and their relatives.</span> <span id="s530">They’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s531">Ruwanda.</span> <span id="s532">The horrors of the Tootsie(ph) Massacres.</span> <span id="s533">It’s just, it’s beyond my understanding that people can think these things can happen and you don’t remember.</span> <span id="s534">Or you’re not gonna, you’re gonna forget.</span> <span id="s535">You can’t ever, ever forget.</span> <span id="s536">You live with that for the rest of your life and your children will live with it, like my son.</span> <span id="s537">He’s got, well he’s got no grandparents and thank heavens I have two sisters and my brother tragically is gone but he’s got two children and his wife is still there and his two children each have three children so he’s got cousins.</span> <span id="s538">He’s, he now has cousins for which I’m very grateful and I’ve got a, I’ve got two sisters whom I love very much with their families so we have that.</span> <span id="s539">And we’re in touch, close touch with my cousins in California which is nice.</span> <span id="s540">But that’s it.</span> <span id="s541">And then, and then just knowing that the rest just didn’t live their lives but they were murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Have you, how do you reconcile in your mind that a man like Hitler could come to power and convince so many people of this superiority?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Well, that’s, that’s sort of the million dollar question.</span> <span id="s544">The way I look at it is that, I think historically...</span></p> <p><span id="s545">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, you asked, you asked why, how, how was Hitler possible and, and I just, as I said we had answers to that, we’d know better.</span> <span id="s548">But I mean I, when I put in context is, is we have had two years, two thousand years, perhaps that’s a little bit, no, really two thousand of unmitigated anti-Semitism in, in, in Europe, perhaps 1500.</span> <span id="s549">But, certainly, the Crusades, the, the Inquisition in Spain, I mean, blaming Jews for the plague.</span> <span id="s550">I mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look at the Bible, this increasing anti-Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews.</span> <span id="s551">You see that developing in the Bible, it wasn’t, that was not the original, the original disciples were not, they were Jews themselves.</span> <span id="s552">But you see, as, as Rome became Christian, they of course had to, to blame Jesus’ death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they had to blame it on the Jews.</span> <span id="s553">And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an increasingly more anti-Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers.</span> <span id="s554">And that became the great montra(ph) in, in European Christianity.</span> <span id="s555">Both Catholicism, Lutheranism is Jews the Christ killers, Jews the blood-suckers, the Jews the Damned, Jews are not gonna go to heaven, it’s only the select Christians who somehow have got the one right answer who are gonna go, who are gonna go to heaven.</span> <span id="s556">And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is, in, in Europe.</span> <span id="s557">You’ve got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that they’re damned and they’re gonna go to hell and they’re, they suck the blood of Christian children.</span> <span id="s558">It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones, the dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the Jewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a, in effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirty for Christians to lend money.</span> <span id="s559">So they could do the dirty jobs.</span> <span id="s560">And then Jews become successful there, they’re being killed because they did.</span> <span id="s561">They became the money lenders and you have Shakespeare and Merchant of Venice and Charlotan(ph), that perpetrating those horrors.</span> <span id="s562">And, and so you’ve got a whole culture of anti-Semitism which was, you have it in France with the Dryfuss(ph) Affair, I mean you have it all through Europe.</span> <span id="s563">In, in eastern Europe with the progroms, you have it all through Europe throughout with intermittent periods where in effect certain rulers(ph) who’d be tolerant of the Jews because they could use them.</span> <span id="s564">So it wasn’t unmitigated, I mean it wasn’t totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of, of some, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish.</span> <span id="s565">And I must say that’s where Holland has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but certainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the Sofottic(ph) Jews with the Inquisition to come to Holland and Holland has had a relatively, extraodinarily wonderful history of, of religious freedom.</span> <span id="s566">And has allowed its Jews to live in relative peace.</span> <span id="s567">But in Germany, Germany with all of its, its effort that becoming a nation-state which it didn’t become until Bismarck with all of its in-fighting and then, and, and a population which is the same as in Holland, this, this, a population that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic belief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God’s word and you do it, then good things are gonna come to you.</span> <span id="s568">And that basically, you obey.</span> <span id="s569">It’s very important to do what you’re told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic of, of, of children must listen to their parents, children must obey, children must not question.</span> <span id="s570">Father knows best.</span> <span id="s571">So you’ve got this, this sort of a cultural pattern of not questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to people, they deserve it.</span> <span id="s572">And then a historical pattern of extreme anti-Semitism, then you’ve got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for Germany in World War I which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then, this, this terrible inflation that impoverished millions of people.</span> <span id="s573">What you do is you find a scapegoat.</span> <span id="s574">And Hitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s575">But people become very vulnerable to, becoming comfortable to, yes, it’s all the Jews’ fault.</span> <span id="s576">Blame somebody else, I mean we do it in this country all the time, is blaming somebody else.</span> <span id="s577">Blame the immigrants.</span> <span id="s578">Blame, blame the illegal aliens.</span> <span id="s579">Blame everybody.</span> <span id="s580">Even blame outside terrorists when we’re breeding our own terrorists.</span> <span id="s581">We have the militia who is so dangerous here.</span> <span id="s582">So you blame, you start blaming others.</span> <span id="s583">And then everybody else is doing it and it becomes really comfortable and then you obey orders and you don’t question and you become self-satisfied and smug because things are getting better.</span> <span id="s584">It’s not, not difficult then to understand the Jews, the traditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here.</span> <span id="s585">And then with German propaganda, they did an unbelievable job of painting Jews as rats.</span> <span id="s586">As vermin.</span> <span id="s587">Destroying the fiber of the great Aryan nation.</span> <span id="s588">And that propaganda is, is staggering, you see some of those propaganda films.</span> <span id="s589">So you put all that together, it’s not surprising.</span> <span id="s590">It’s not difficult to make people hate others.</span> <span id="s591">And that’s why for me, questioning, always questioning, never accepting what people tell you without really examining the validity of any of it and never allowing others to dictate your moral stands.</span> <span id="s592">It’s just so vital.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: But weren’t Jews fully integrated into German society and wasn’t there a lot of interchange ...</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: So didn’t the Nazi propaganda contradict what people’s daily experiences were?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">But that didn’t seem to bother most people in Germany.</span> <span id="s598">That was exactly right because Jews were given a chance.</span> <span id="s599">It’s been just remarkable.</span> <span id="s600">Jews, I don’t know how they manage.</span> <span id="s601">But they have, they’re like that little ball that you put down it comes on up, Jews have always been like that little ball.</span> <span id="s602">They just, they just somehow cope.</span> <span id="s603">And so indeed, in the early 19, in the early 1900s, there had been a period of, of freedom for Jews and Jews had done extraordinarily well in Germany and they were the heart and soul of the cultural scene in Berlin.</span> <span id="s604">I mean that was the great _______ and others, _________ great artists, great painters were Jews and, and merchants and, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Intellectuals and professors [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Oh, absolutely the intellectuals, I mean, my goodness.</span> <span id="s607">They came to America, Albert Einstein and many of the great physicists who fled.</span> <span id="s608">Yeah, they, they, the Jews had just, had become integral part, I mean my grandfather is a perfect example of that.</span> <span id="s609">My grandfather had some stores, was a very wealthy man and a very prominent man in his little town which before the war was Germany.</span> <span id="s610">After World War I became part of Poland.</span> <span id="s611">Zupolni(ph), it was Simpleburg(ph) then and he had given hundreds of thousands of marks for the German war effort.</span> <span id="s612">That’s how come he got his, his cross, he got his Cross of Merit which saved my, my father’s life, but my grandfather, yes, he was a German.</span> <span id="s613">And yeah, right.</span> <span id="s614">And so, yes, you’re absolutely right.</span> <span id="s615">And it’s amazing how easy it is to turn that around and so your neighbors whom you, whom you loved before are now become your enemies.</span> <span id="s616">You see it in Bosnia, you saw it in Sarajevo, you saw it in Mostar(ph), where Muslims and Croats who’d lived and served, who’d lived together as friends, all of a sudden start betraying and even murdering each other.</span> <span id="s617">It hasn’t changed.</span> <span id="s618">It just hasn’t changed.</span> <span id="s619">And don’t ask me what it is in human nature that allows us to become such animals.</span> <span id="s620">I, no, I, I insult the animals when I say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Well some of it must be based on a fear for your own security somehow, don’t you think?</span> <span id="s622">Or, or at least that plays into it?</span> <span id="s623">[talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I think it’s a copout, I don’t know, no, no, it doesn’t have to be like that.</span> <span id="s625">All it has to be is some evil, evil men and it’s mostly men who feed into people’s stupidity, ignorance and then who will light that what is evil in men and then, and then makes them justify the murder of their neighbors.</span> <span id="s626">And they do it.</span> <span id="s627">I mean, in, in Bosnia, it’s, it’s happened there.</span> <span id="s628">Neighbors murdering neighbors.</span> <span id="s629">People been friends.</span> <span id="s630">Explain that.</span> <span id="s631">Look what’s happening in Ireland still.</span> <span id="s632">In the name of what?</span> <span id="s633">Religion?</span> <span id="s634">It’s not really religion.</span> <span id="s635">It’s, it’s, it’s how the, how few people can destroy, no, it’s how individuals allow themselves to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s636">I still won’t, I won’t even blame the people because if people weren’t so stupid, they would recognize the horror of what these people are pronouncing.</span> <span id="s637">We’re seeing it here, some blacks, there’s some horrendous anti-Semitism of Farakhan(ph) is doing.</span> <span id="s638">Is evil, is total evil in what he is saying about the Jews as blood-suckers.</span> <span id="s639">And those blacks who believe in that are just as evil because they’re perpetrating, they’re perpetrating that what makes them possible to kill and murder.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: And this, despite the fact that there’s been quite an alliance between Jews and blacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Jews have more than almost any other group has tried to help blacks.</span> <span id="s642">And then, and, and as far as I’ve concerned, because I’ve, I’ve been, I’m totally committed to other people’s well-being but unless, unless, and they’re have been, I must also admit that Farrakhan(ph) is, is not the spokesman for all blacks that there have been many blacks who’ve spoken out strongly against that and that I haven’t heard lately too much that he is continued to spout his, his venom but unless there is a, a total condemnation which some blacks have done, thank God, of that, that to me is evil and needs to be, needs to be dealt with as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Did your experiences in World War II cause you to reexamine your relationship to God or to ask is there a just God or things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s645">I, I don’t believe in the God of Christianity and Judaism at all.</span> <span id="s646">I, I cannot imagine a God that allows these kinds of things to happen and I think it’s man who does it.</span> <span id="s647">Basically, I have this very peaceful concept of what I, I look at the world roundly and I say there was something greater than just we humans but I see it as a great spirit of love that allows for all the best in us to flourish.</span> <span id="s648">Basically, it’s a life on earth here that is the test of what we do with our lives but that in terms of a God, whatever happens to us afterwards, there is no discrimination there.</span> <span id="s649">God does not discriminate, a God does not perpetuate evil, a God does not condone, a God is not petty the way the Christian god is, a petty god who says you’ve gotta do it this way, you’ve gotta do it that way, otherwise you’re gonna be damned.</span> <span id="s650">That’s not a god, that’s a human, that’s a human being.</span> <span id="s651">That’s the kind of petty judgmental pronouncement that humans make but not a god, not a great spirit of love, so, I’m, yes, I’m sort of anti-organized religion as far as I’m concerned.</span> <span id="s652">I realize it does a lot of good for a lot of people.</span> <span id="s653">I respect people who believe those things, that’s their business.</span> <span id="s654">And if it brings them happiness and if it helps them be good people, and then, I’m, I’m all in favor.</span> <span id="s655">So I don’t judge them for what they believe but for myself I absolutely am at peace that the god of Christianity and Judaism is certainly not my god.</span> <span id="s656">Because I couldn’t live with a god like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: What is your problem with the god of Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: It’s a pretty, pretty judgmental god, too, it’s too judgmental.</span> <span id="s659">It’s, it’s a god that tells people what to do and what not to do.</span> <span id="s660">If you look at it, it’s, show your belief in me by sacrificing your, your son, Isaac.</span> <span id="s661">It’s, it’s a punitive god, not, as I said, I, I, people say man was created in God’s image, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s662">I think God was created in man’s image.</span> <span id="s663">And that men, and I mean men again, men have used religion to control the world and they have misused, misused God to perpetrate their own evils.</span> <span id="s664">They and, and then as soon as you say you do something in the name of God, then people can’t, then, then it’s above and beyond, it becomes you no longer are responsible because you’re doing for, for, for God, well, I, I think of whatever great spirit there is, that, that how horrendous that has been misused.</span> <span id="s665">Because it’s, I think religion has been used to, to control and to perpetuate, perpetuate this control.</span> <span id="s666">That’s how I think of religion.</span> <span id="s667">That’s why I can’t belong to any organized group.</span> <span id="s668">I just can’t because even though I know that a lot of good is done in the name of religion, I, I think that the bad outweighs the good.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So you don’t go to the synagogue now?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span> <span id="s671">I don’t go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Does your husband go?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No.</span> <span id="s674">He’s not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No.</span> <span id="s677">We don’t.</span> <span id="s678">I can’t, I just can’t.</span> <span id="s679">I can’t listen to all this and I, I, as a matter of fact, I, my mother, when she was, she had a cancer operation, she was in the hospital and she was not doing well so I went to visit her.</span> <span id="s680">My brother, by the way, converted to Christianity and became extremely religious.</span> <span id="s681">His two children are very religious Christians.</span> <span id="s682">And my mother was telling the nurse who was also a very religious man, Christian, she was telling him about the war experiences and about how we were saved, miraculously saved and his words were, “Well, God must have had very special plans for you.”</span> <span id="s683">And I just exploded.</span> <span id="s684">And I said, “If God had special plans for us, then did he have special plans to let six million other be murdered and massacred?”</span> <span id="s685">“No, that’s not what I mean!”</span> <span id="s686">I said, “You can’t have it both ways.”</span> <span id="s687">We weren’t any better than those other six million.</span> <span id="s688">If God picked us out then, then that God was responsible and I’m not gonna make that God responsible for the evil of men.</span> <span id="s689">That is not what God is all about in my opinion.</span> <span id="s690">I can’t listen, I can’t listen to that kind of stuff because it’s putting onto God something that men has perpetrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Is there something, in your opinion, about religion, say both Jewish and Catholic and Protestant and all that, Christianity to group them all, is there something that you think also perhaps perpetuates people not thinking for themselves completely and taking responsibilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s693">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s694">You can’t think too much.</span> <span id="s695">As a matter of fact, it’s really interesting.</span> <span id="s696">My son is involved with a lovely young woman who is Catholic and she wanted to, she decided she was gonna be Catholic, she wanted to be the best Catholic possible so she thought of becoming a nun.</span> <span id="s697">And then she said, “Well then I better really go and know, read the Bible.”</span> <span id="s698">And she said she started reading the Bible.</span> <span id="s699">And the more she read the Bible, the more she began to see the internal contradictions that, that the Bible is full of because she’s a real scholar.</span> <span id="s700">She’s a real intellect.</span> <span id="s701">And she said, she said, then she said she went to her friends and said, “Please convince me how to be a good Catholic,” and none of her friends could convince her.</span> <span id="s702">And because basically, in order to be a good anything, you can’t read, read the Bible from a scholarly perspective.</span> <span id="s703">So I discussed it with some very lovely, lovely young people who are also devout, devoted Christians and I said, “Well, how do you deal with this?</span> <span id="s704">That the innumerable contradictions in the Bible.”</span> <span id="s705">And they said, “Well, basically, it’s important to study it but you can’t go too far because what you need to have is you need to have faith that basically what the Bible tells you is correct.</span> <span id="s706">So you can’t,” they said, their words were, “the theologians who really examine the Bible carefully, they just, they just go too far.”</span> <span id="s707">So there is a limit to what you, you can read the Bible but don’t read the Bible too far and I gather in Catholicism this has been the thing.</span> <span id="s708">That’s why you had the catechism because the catechism gives you the one correct line.</span> <span id="s709">Yes, and then this whole issue of control.</span> <span id="s710">As long as I tell what the right way is and if there’s only one right way.</span> <span id="s711">and if you question, you’re gonna be damned.</span> <span id="s712">Just think of the power and control involved in that, how dangerous that potentially is.</span> <span id="s713">It’s dangerous for you when people stop thinking.</span> <span id="s714">When people stop thinking, anything is possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Let’s see ...</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Gee, this is really ...</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: I know, they didn’t actually tell me to get so intellectual but to me the, well actually Nina Ellis(ph) did bring up God because she said a lot of people have done some very, very critical thinking about religion since the war.</span> <span id="s718">Who lived, why me?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Why, why us?</span> <span id="s720">Pure unadulterated luck.</span> <span id="s721">That’s why we survived.</span> <span id="s722">Not because God chose us.</span> <span id="s723">That’s an evil God who would do that and there’s no such thing as an evil God.</span> <span id="s724">That’s contradictory, it’s a oxymoron.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And, and she told me that a lot of survivors have had a pretty difficult time coming to terms with God and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Rabbi Kushner(ph) wrote a book “When Bad Things Happen to Good People”.</span> <span id="s727">His son who died of this, I forgot the name of the disease but it’s where there’s the rapid maturing and then death and he also, he also had asked God “Why me?”</span> <span id="s728">and also came to conclusion that this, that’s not the god of, of really, that’s, it’s not the god who decides you and not you and I, I must say if I were to pick one religion, well perhaps, I find the eastern religions really more acceptable because they’re much less judgmental.</span> <span id="s729">Buddhism for example is a, although they, they become then just as controlling.</span> <span id="s730">It’s not the religion that is so bad, it’s the people are so bad.</span> <span id="s731">But I still would, I could never, never be a Christian because of its horrendous judgmental perspective.</span> <span id="s732">But I could, I, I, Judaism still is the most attractive religion to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: It is a, an intellectual religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes, it’s a questioning religion, it’s an exploring religion so it is for me still, it’s, it’s still the one religion that I’m by far the most attracted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Was there a, a Quaker religious class in your school in, during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So they didn’t push their religion on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: No, after the war, after the war, after liberated I had to go to a Catholic school and boy did they push religion there and again, that’s why in this country, this, this separation between church and state is so important because they don’t have that in Holland.</span> <span id="s739">The, the state supports all sorts of religions and what it breeds is, is, is separatism.</span> <span id="s740">Now again the Dutch, bless their hearts, are, are really quite remarkable.</span> <span id="s741">They’ve, they’ve seen the light and our, have become many ways probably among the most tolerant of all people in this world.</span> <span id="s742">I’m very impressed with them, at least the ones I’ve met.</span> <span id="s743">But, but you have to go to Catholic schools, very painful to be only non-Catholics and soon as, course soon as we were liberated there was, we could tell people we were Jewish, then there were immediately excluded.</span> <span id="s744">Dirty Jews, Christ killers.</span> <span id="s745">Right smack after we’re liberated, the war wasn’t even over.</span> <span id="s746">As long as we weren’t Jewish, it was safe but as soon as we were freed and we became Jewish, it became unsafe again and so that’s why we had to hide it.</span> <span id="s747">It wasn’t safe to be Jewish in Holland and, and, it’s very interesting, I just read in the paper last week about a group of young Germans who want to atone for their parents’ and grandparents’, sins of, they, they have come to America because there are no Jews left in Germany or very few.</span> <span id="s748">They’ve come to America to work in homes for the, for the aged.</span> <span id="s749">Really wonderful.</span> <span id="s750">I’m so impressed.</span> <span id="s751">And they said that it’s, they were so grateful that they were not, they were not judged here.</span> <span id="s752">They were so grateful that they were not damned here and they said it was also wonderful for them to get to know Jews because she said in Germany being a Jew is still bad.</span> <span id="s753">And I was saying yes, I know it.</span> <span id="s754">Even in Holland, people are uncomfortable with people who are Jewish.</span> <span id="s755">When I tell people I’m Jewish, you can feel the discomfort.</span> <span id="s756">Not all, but some.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: And you mentioned in, in your first interview and brought it up again briefly during this one that there’s, you, do you still have some discomfort being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: No, not anymore.</span> <span id="s759">Totally not.</span> <span id="s760">I wear my little hi(ph) around my neck and say to the world this is who I am.</span> <span id="s761">If people know what it is.</span> <span id="s762">All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: But that took a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Forty years.</span> <span id="s765">Took me forever, forever.</span> <span id="s766">And now I will never deny the six million, ever, ever, ever.</span> <span id="s767">So in my heart I’m totally Jewish, I’m just religious wise, I’m not.</span> <span id="s768">But in my heart, I’m completely Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: What about your sisters?</span> <span id="s770">Do they practice religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: No, none of us do.</span> <span id="s772">We, the town we lived in before the war had a synagogue, had Jewish life after the war, 152 in the Jewish Museum in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s773">I, on the little computer you can, you can get those numbers.</span> <span id="s774">There were 152 Jews before the war in Braydare(ph), 12 of us survived.</span> <span id="s775">Twelve came back and we were six of the 12.</span> <span id="s776">I know all the ones who survived, can tell you, even give their names, still give you their names.</span> <span id="s777">There was no Jewish life left.</span> <span id="s778">I remember once after the war, it must have been 1948 and we went at night.</span> <span id="s779">It was, I think, was it Yom Kippur or was it, may have been Yom Kippur, we went to, because then there was no, no Jewish community left, no temple, we went to a Jewish service.</span> <span id="s780">And we went at night when it was dark, so it was fallen, it was dark and it was just like we still had to be careful not to be seen.</span> <span id="s781">That was the only time I remember that we had some Jewish celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: I think ’48.</span> <span id="s784">And then nothing after that.</span> <span id="s785">There were no Jews left, they killed everybody.</span> <span id="s786">So, and then so, you, you combine the fact that the destruction of all your Jewish life and then of all your fellow Jews and then living in the country being a Jew was a bad thing, because that was basically the message to us still, but being a Jew, much safer for you to keep your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s787">And as far as I’m concerned, most Jews who still live in Holland are still in hiding.</span> <span id="s788">I went to a conference in 1992, the first conference of the Hidden Children.</span> <span id="s789">Five hundred of us _______ were there, in Amsterdam, was a wonderful experience for me.</span> <span id="s790">And about a quarter of the Jews, the surviving Jews emigrated to, mostly to America, Canada, Australia and of course, Israel and, and so a bunch of us came back.</span> <span id="s791">It was, was wonderful but there were Jews there, survivors, who had know each other and had not known they were survivors.</span> <span id="s792">They knew each other as Jews but not as survivors.</span> <span id="s793">You didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s794">You went on with your life.</span> <span id="s795">You didn’t deal with it.</span> <span id="s796">I’ve got, not my cousin, but my cousin’s cousin in Holland, I don’t want to deal with this, just, just forget it and just from the, my cousin, my one surviving cousin in seething with anger.</span> <span id="s797">She is seething with anger.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: She hasn’t really recovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: She’ll never, she’ll never recover.</span> <span id="s800">She’ll never recover.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Are you one of the few people she’s spoken to about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Well, no, I mean, she has, I have asked her questions and she talks about it but it’s too painful for her.</span> <span id="s803">She survived because she escaped the Dutch concentration camp and she was there with her little sister.</span> <span id="s804">And, oh gosh, you think about this.</span> <span id="s805">She was there with little sister, she was there when her parents were taken to the concentration camps, taken out of the hospital, taken to Westerbork, and put on the train to Auschwitz and she begged them to please leave her little sister, was exactly my age, little, few months older, Lainie(ph) was her name.</span> <span id="s806">She begged them to please... [End of side 1 of tape 2]...___________ begged her, she, she was, she was, she was at Westerbork, the Dutch concentration camp, she was there when her parents then came.</span> <span id="s807">And they were both very sick and they first took the sick and they, to the gas chambers and she begged them to please leave Lainie(ph) with her because that somehow was still possible.</span> <span id="s808">Her parents insisted Lainie(ph) would go with them.</span> <span id="s809">To Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s810">That’s what she has to live with.</span> <span id="s811">This hard.</span> <span id="s812">When we were just in Holland right now, we went to the, May 4th is Memorial Day and so we went to the Jewish Cemetery in Ossin(ph), which is, most of my father’s family was all from northern Holland, from Ossin(ph), Emmen,(ph), Hoanigan(ph), that area, and there was, we went to the Jewish, Jewish Cemetery in Holland which miraculously was not destroyed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s813">And they have Memorial there, too, to the 500 Dutch Jews who were either taken to Auschwitz from that little town or those who died in the concentration camp in Westerbork and there is my aunt and my uncle and my, and her, and it’s my, my cousin’s sister and her parents.</span> <span id="s814">And so the great blessing of, of being America is at least I don’t have the daily reminders of that either.</span> <span id="s815">That at least, here you can, here, not you cannot forget it but at least you don’t have the continual reminders of what happened.</span> <span id="s816">Where you were, easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And what about the other two cousins, you said there’s two others who came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: How are they doing?</span> <span id="s820">Where are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Exceedingly well.</span> <span id="s822">I must say, we’ve all done so well in this country.</span> <span id="s823">Yeah, my, they, they were my father’s oldest brother who survived, he’s the only one who survived, children.</span> <span id="s824">He had three children.</span> <span id="s825">Their son, Bertus(ph), was I gather, just a wonderful young man.</span> <span id="s826">He was among the first one killed because he was on the train and made some anti-Nazi remark.</span> <span id="s827">When they found out he was a Jew, they were shot immediately.</span> <span id="s828">He had two daughters who all, they survived in hiding.</span> <span id="s829">Hetty(ph), the oldest, who just turned 80 as a matter, no, is turning 80 in August 16th, she, she married and, and, she married in 1940, I think just before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s830">No, just after the war had broken out.</span> <span id="s831">She married July 4th to a very nice guy and then she had a baby in 1942 and that baby was put in, in with hundreds of other, I don’t know how many hundred, shuffled from one family to the next, her name is Betty, after her brother.</span> <span id="s832">And then there was Sarai(ph), who was 12 and they, they also, they survived on hidings like we did except I think they were, they were not out in the open the way we were.</span> <span id="s833">And so they, after the war, we came to America in 1952, Hetty(ph) and Herman(ph) came in 1953.</span> <span id="s834">And we left Holland because Holland just, just was not a good place to be in those days.</span> <span id="s835">And they, they came to California and did extraordinarily well.</span> <span id="s836">Her, she had then three children when the came and those three young ladies all married and have children and have sort of lived the American dreams.</span> <span id="s837">However, however, as far as I’m concerned, there is horrendous damage in all of them because of the war.</span> <span id="s838">On the surface, they are the absolute, outstanding examples of survivors but I know, I know what horrendous pain they’ve gone through and how, what horrendous damage has been done.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Are there any ways that you can describe them when you’re with them that you see that come up?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I have to be very careful because what’s interesting is that Hetty(ph) and Herman(ph) who I adore, just absolutely wonderful people, they did exactly what the rest of us did, is that forget it, forget it.</span> <span id="s841">Try to forget it, go on with your life.</span> <span id="s842">Don’t talk about it, don’t deal with it but for heaven’s sakes, and I think that has been a hallmark for at least our family, is prove that the Germans, that the Nazis were wrong, prove that you’re okay.</span> <span id="s843">Prove that you’re a person of value.</span> <span id="s844">And so how do you prove that?</span> <span id="s845">By accomplishing things.</span> <span id="s846">And by golly, did they accomplish.</span> <span id="s847">But in that effort to accomplish, they, the children, except for the youngest, the two older girls had to fend for, had to fend for themselves a great deal and were to some extent neglected.</span> <span id="s848">And not because they wanted to do that but because they, they had, they felt they had to work so hard to, to make it in this country.</span> <span id="s849">And they did make in this country.</span> <span id="s850">And then all of that tension and all of the pain was never discussed so it, it affected their lives and these girls grew up knowing about their background partly but not dealing with it.</span> <span id="s851">Not, it, without it being discussed.</span> <span id="s852">And so they become adults and they, they have to deal with it in, in their own way, and, and, again I don’t wanna talk about their circumstances because that’s not up to me to do so.</span> <span id="s853">But I know, because of my background, that tremendous harm was done and that, there was enormous pain and my, the oldest one, Betty, who is, who, who was born during the war, I mean she knows it, she’s done a lot of talking about it and, and she is aware of, of, she’s aware of the horrendous pain.</span> <span id="s854">And she also’s been trying, try to do her best and yet has not really actualized herself the way I, phenomenal potential, highly intelligent young woman.</span> <span id="s855">They all are very bright, very competent.</span> <span id="s856">But unlike my family, where my parents never were successful, though they spent, so they spent a lot of time with us, we, we have, I think, my sisters, we have all really truly actualized ourselves, intellectually, emotionally.</span> <span id="s857">I don’t, except for the youngest, who came along young enough that I think her parents had more time for her, the other two just haven’t.</span> <span id="s858">And I think it’s causing, it’s caused a lot of pain.</span> <span id="s859">And then the war years, again, the, the lack of open discussions, up until lately, up until just the last couple of years, means that there’s all this stuff in your background and you, you know something went wrong but you don’t, you don’t discuss it.</span> <span id="s860">You pretend everything is just perfect and wonderful and they’re prototype of that.</span> <span id="s861">Everything is perfect and wonderful always.</span> <span id="s862">Particularly with Hetty and Herman(ph), when you talk to them, man, it’s always perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Like the Ozzie Nelson family?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: The Nelson family?</span> <span id="s866">What was that show, Father Knows Best?</span> <span id="s867">We, in America we had all these programs that made the typical American family seem so perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Perfect, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Nothing ever went wrong, no one ...</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: ever humiliated the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Absolutely and everybody’s always doing, everybody’s always doing perfectly and the kids are always great, and this is fine and this is fine and this is fine.</span> <span id="s873">That’s, you get that particularly from the parents more than from the, from the daughters.</span> <span id="s874">And you just, I wanna, sometimes say for God sakes, that’s not really what’s going on and I know it and how much healthier to be able to deal with it and recognize that there is pain and misery.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: And your sisters, is there a contrast in how they dealt with recovering from those traumas?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s877">I’ve been by far the most verbal, by far.</span> <span id="s878">That’s because I have the best memory, too.</span> <span id="s879">They, Ingrid is two years, one year younger and Helga’s two years younger.</span> <span id="s880">So, I was six when the war broke out, Ingrid’s five and Helga was four and I have much better memories than, than they do.</span> <span id="s881">I also, I also developed myself intellectually, I’m the, I’m the only one who immediately went to college and then to graduate school and ended up with a PhD.</span> <span id="s882">They, I have enormous, enormous respect for my sisters.</span> <span id="s883">They, they both went to nursing school and became nurses.</span> <span id="s884">But then my youngest sister went on and went to college and got her degree and then went on and became a, a nurse pediatric clinician.</span> <span id="s885">So, and this, she is a remarkable young lady, I mean was, she, all of us did very badly in Holland.</span> <span id="s886">Academically, all of us fell apart.</span> <span id="s887">And Helga, my youngest sister developed a horrendous thyroid condition and, and stopped learning and stopped, she just, oh, tense and miserable and unhappy.</span> <span id="s888">So when, so she didn’t go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s889">So she was 14 and missed enormous amounts of school.</span> <span id="s890">We came to America, again thank God, and, and, and she, we came to America in December of ’52 and the following summer, she was operated on in Jewish hospital and they took out this huge goiter.</span> <span id="s891">It was benign and she grew five inches.</span> <span id="s892">She was just tiny developed and went back to school and she’s a very bright young lady.</span> <span id="s893">But she had to, whereas I sort of followed the classic route high school and college and graduate school, she, they went to nursing school which doesn’t really, in those days, she didn’t go to the university but to a hospital nursing program so they never had the chance to really develop their, oh how do I say this, their intellect in a way that I had.</span> <span id="s894">And so they did it later and then Ingrid also went to college and ended up as a, she, she graduated also from college so they, in their adulthood, they did phenomenally and Helga, my youngest sister is, has just done spectacularly.</span> <span id="s895">She worked for the World Council of Nurses and does workshops around the world on delivering primary care in underserved areas.</span> <span id="s896">She is a expert on, on infant and maternal healthcare.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: But so did their recovery come later if they examined some of these issues later?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: You know we all have different backgrounds.</span> <span id="s899">I was the child who tried to be perfect, so I had this total sense of worthlessness so my recovery had to be believing myself again.</span> <span id="s900">My middle sister, I don’t think, I mean my middle sister has also accomplished a great deal.</span> <span id="s901">Build a business but I think still suffers tremendously from low self-esteem, a lack of self-worth.</span> <span id="s902">So I don’t think, I don’t think she has recovered and they have not dealt with it as extensively.</span> <span id="s903">My youngest sister, it’s hard for me to say.</span> <span id="s904">She functions exquisitely.</span> <span id="s905">She is married, has four children, is a grandmother, just, just also has fulfilled the American dream.</span> <span id="s906">A wonderful mother, wonderful grandmother, but also I don’t think has, we can talk.</span> <span id="s907">She and I can talk.</span> <span id="s908">But I don’t think she has worked as extensively as I have at sort of making all the connections so I cannot, okay, the way, and so the way it manifested for her that she, like me, when she was raising her children, she also had to be perfect.</span> <span id="s909">She also had to do everything right.</span> <span id="s910">She also had to cope.</span> <span id="s911">She also never could complain.</span> <span id="s912">She’s another one of those, and so is my middle sister too, unbelievable women who just do.</span> <span id="s913">Just like my mother.</span> <span id="s914">But in the process of doing for others, that’s not so hot either because then your children don’t really get the message that they need to do for themselves so what we have done to our children, we’ve done too much for our children.</span> <span id="s915">And I think that I, more than the others, was aware of that.</span> <span id="s916">I think that’s the big difference, that in raising our son, that I would, that I was over, I was overprotective of him but from the very beginning I would say to him, “Loren(ph), this is my problem, not your problem.</span> <span id="s917">I am sorry that I need to know where you are all the time.</span> <span id="s918">It’s not because I don’t trust you, it’s because inside of me, I cannot still cannot believe that you’re really, that, that you’re gonna be with me.</span> <span id="s919">That I just to know.</span> <span id="s920">So please, please understand where I’m coming from.”</span> <span id="s921">So from the very beginning I, I would, I would, when I did those things that could have been destructive, I let Loren(ph) know that it wasn’t his fault and that was my problem and because he is so incredibly bright and sensitive, he understood and tolerated that.</span> <span id="s922">So he, he has all his life been willing to, to work with me and let me know where he is, I mean that’s been the major thing.</span> <span id="s923">Let, just let me know where you are and he’s always done so, throughout his adolescence.</span> <span id="s924">If he would be late, he’d call me up.</span> <span id="s925">Never resented it.</span> <span id="s926">And, and I think part of it was that I let him know that, I let him know what my problems were because of the war.</span> <span id="s927">My overprotectiveness, my fear of losing him.</span> <span id="s928">Whereas my sisters, I think did the same thing but in a, they, they didn’t quite communicate all these ideas to their children.</span> <span id="s929">Now the kids have been, they’re fine but, but, but whereas Loren(ph) has extraordinarily high self-esteem, extraordinarily, I mean, is so confident about who he is and so directed and so purposeful and so at peace with himself.</span> <span id="s930">I, he is, he is a, he’s one of the healthiest people I’ve ever met in my life.</span> <span id="s931">And I think that a lot of it has to do with, with my understanding of my own neuroses.</span> <span id="s932">And talking about those things with him from the time he was very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: And where is he now?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Loren(ph) is at MIT.</span> <span id="s935">He is a third year graduate student at MIT, in cognitive systems neuroscience.</span> <span id="s936">He is a, he is a, he is an incredible, wonderful young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: And he graduated, did he graduate from Carlton(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: He graduated from Carlton(ph).</span> <span id="s939">He went here to the Academy, Albuquerque Academy, and graduated from Carlton(ph) College just ...</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: In Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: In, in Northfield, Northfield south of Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s942">Summa cum laude and the whole bit.</span> <span id="s943">Phi Beta Kappa and whatever else and got a National Science Foundation Fellowship which is to, to MIT.</span> <span id="s944">Pretty much had his choice of where he wanted to go and has just been this incredibly, incredibly bright, but more, even more important than that, sensitive, aware and healthy.</span> <span id="s945">This, this incredibly healthy human being who is the exact opposite of the classic Nazi follower.</span> <span id="s946">Loren(ph) doesn’t take anything for granted.</span> <span id="s947">Loren(ph) will question anything.</span> <span id="s948">Loren(ph) will explore.</span> <span id="s949">Loren(ph) will research.</span> <span id="s950">Loren(ph), I mean I, it’s one of the great joys, Loren(ph) thinks for himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Which is probably one of your larger goals with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: From the very beginning.</span> <span id="s953">We would have, my, Alan is a psychiatrist and I’m in this field also and so we discuss always discuss ideas with him, always.</span> <span id="s954">And ask his opinion and he, from the time he was very young, had these remarkable insights into people!</span> <span id="s955">Incredible insights into people.</span> <span id="s956">But the very beginning we would encourage these discussions and encourage the questioning and, and never insist that he do it our way, just really encouraging to do it his way within a framework of course, of limits.</span> <span id="s957">I mean, I’m not saying there weren’t limits, there were limits, but, and it’s just had such a huge payoff because he’s so inner directed and motivated and at peace with himself with who he is.</span> <span id="s958">The exact opposite of who I was, it’s just amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Does he see the world as a very safe place for him basically?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I think he sees himself, which is to me the clue to happiness, he sees himself as being safe in this world.</span> <span id="s961">It’s not that the world is safe and I don’t, I know the world isn’t safe but I also now feel safe in this world because I know I can cope.</span> <span id="s962">And that’s how Loren(ph) feels.</span> <span id="s963">Loren(ph) is safe.</span> <span id="s964">Loren(ph) is convinced that he can do what he wants to do, meaning, not in that he can do anything he wants to do but that when he sets his, when he sets his mind on accomplishing something, he will accomplish it.</span> <span id="s965">He’s totally inner directed, he has complete sense, internal sense of locus(ph) control.</span> <span id="s966">And, and a complete belief that things will work out for him because he is safe in this world.</span> <span id="s967">And it’s amazing, I feel safe in this world now, too.</span> <span id="s968">It’s amazing when you feel that way, how things do go right.</span> <span id="s969">And it’s not because the world is safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Right, I asked the question sort of backwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Yeah, no, but I, I think you’re hitting critical perspective from my, because, because we were raised, I mean we, my sisters, my brother and I were raised in this horrendously dangerous world.</span> <span id="s972">I mean the world was so unsafe for us and it remained unsafe for so many years and the clue to happiness, the clue to no, the clue to our well-being has been to be able to begin to feel safe in this, in this world.</span> <span id="s973">And that’s not an easy transition to make because it basically means you stop looking at the outer world to become safe for you but you, you become safe within yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: How do you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Hard work.</span> <span id="s976">Hard work.</span> <span id="s977">It’s, it’s, as I work with people, that’s what I really try and teach them is how do you do that and, and, for me, the, the single most important clue is that when I was so unsafe and felt so defeated, I let the whole world define me.</span> <span id="s978">It was Anita who had to be this perfect, obedient, good, accepting, non-creative basically, because if I did anything creative, my goodness, it might annoy people so this trapped in a, in a box person who tried to please everybody and tried to avoid making anybody mad so that at least I would get positive input from others.</span> <span id="s979">I mean going back to Elizabeth Dixon is, she, I had to translate that at least she values me.</span> <span id="s980">Well, if she values me, there must be some value to me ‘cause I didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s981">So it is stopping that, it’s stopping looking to others to make you feel safe and begin to really get to know yourself and define yourself.</span> <span id="s982">It’s at self-definition.</span> <span id="s983">It’s knowing who you are.</span> <span id="s984">It’s knowing your strengths, knowing your weaknesses.</span> <span id="s985">It is when people are mad at you, it’s not to say oh my gosh, I’m a bad person but to say, oh, you’re mad at me.</span> <span id="s986">Well, who’s problem is it?</span> <span id="s987">Is it your problem, is it really something I’ve done?</span> <span id="s988">If it’s something I’ve done, that’s something I can learn from.</span> <span id="s989">What do I need to, I need to work on changing that so it’s not closing myself off from others, it’s remaining open to the input that others give me but at a very, on a very limited basis.</span> <span id="s990">Because I recognize that everybody else is probably crazier than I am and to let other people define me, hah!</span> <span id="s991">What a joke that is.</span> <span id="s992">I mean we, the Nazis defined us as dirty, filthy Jews worthy of extermination.</span> <span id="s993">No one will ever define me again.</span> <span id="s994">So it’s partly again, it’s a reaction to that.</span> <span id="s995">Nobody will define me.</span> <span id="s996">I will define myself.</span> <span id="s997">But within the context of my environment so to avoid becoming this extreme narcissist, you, you want to remain open to input but you want to weigh it against what you know about yourself.</span> <span id="s998">That’s, and this way you keep on growing and the, and the most wonderful thing is the more at peace you are with yourself, the nicer you can be to other people.</span> <span id="s999">You don’t, cause you don’t have to destroy others to feel good about yourself.</span> <span id="s1000">As a matter of fact, it hurts you to be negative or destructive to others and so you know that those who are destructive, there’s something wrong with them.</span> <span id="s1001">Because if you truly feel good about yourself, you don’t, you don’t want to hurt others, cause it hurts you if you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Did you ever go through any psychotherapy and examine these kinds of issues?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1004">I’ve done a lot of it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: And you married the man who is in the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1007">Who never psychoanalyzed me, ever, ever, ever.</span> <span id="s1008">Whose greatest gift to me I still think is to basically say, Anita you’ve gotta go take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s1009">And Anita thought, okay, I don’t particularly like that but that makes a lot of sense.</span> <span id="s1010">And who said, okay, I’m gonna do this and that has been Alan’s lack of control over me and lack of need to, to have me be a particular way but whose support for me, for myself, whoever I wanted to become was always there.</span> <span id="s1011">Was just my, has been my perfect partner.</span> <span id="s1012">Absolutely perfect partner.</span> <span id="s1013">I don’t think I would be the person I am now without sort of having, without having been with that person who was so wonderful about letting me be who I basically had a potential to be.</span> <span id="s1014">Was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Sounds great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: It is.</span> <span id="s1017">It’s wonderful, it’s rare.</span> <span id="s1018">It’s so rare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: And even more rare probably for people in their fifties and, and in terms of man being that way...</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Oh yes, and particularly for a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1021">My goodness, after all they know how the world works.</span> <span id="s1022">As far as he was concerned, he didn’t and it was up to me to figure it out for myself.</span> <span id="s1023">And I, what is interesting in my work with people, I’ve learned a lot from working with people.</span> <span id="s1024">They have been my teachers.</span> <span id="s1025">Right now I work at the medical school.</span> <span id="s1026">I have a wonderful job at the medical school but when I worked with patients, I learned from them.</span> <span id="s1027">And I learned what not to do and I, I, I integrated and incorporated all those ideas in my own, in my own behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: And that’s when you were counseling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yeah, then I, for years I did counseling.</span> <span id="s1030">My way.</span> <span id="s1031">Never anybody else’s way, always my way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: What does that mean?</span> <span id="s1033">What rules did you break?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Oh, I broke all the rules.</span> <span id="s1035">I broke every rule and that is that the classic rules of counseling are that all these worries about transference and counter-transference and all this other garbage and how you need to let the patient come up with all the solutions and how you don’t insert yourself into it and how you don’t, all these things.</span> <span id="s1036">I broke every single one of those rules.</span> <span id="s1037">And what I basically, what I, the way I perceived it, it was more reeducating people, the way I had to reeducate myself and that is to help people to begin to define, learn how to define themselves and, and begin to appreciate themselves and how, how to do that.</span> <span id="s1038">I’ve got a whole schema for doing that and, and I would come up with ideas but always in such a way that I would say look.</span> <span id="s1039">I’m just gonna share these with you.</span> <span id="s1040">These are tools.</span> <span id="s1041">It, everything is in your control.</span> <span id="s1042">Everything is within your power so always leave you the power and leave in the control with, with my clients.</span> <span id="s1043">And as a result, I could develop very equal relationships and people never saw me as telling what to do but it was a sharing which was super healing.</span> <span id="s1044">It, it just, and it was amazing how quickly people, not everybody but an overwhelming majority were able to just begin to look at their life from a different perspective and learn different ways of dealing with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: So in other words, you didn’t exercise that power that the authority figure or expert has?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Exactly, never.</span> <span id="s1047">I was never the expert.</span> <span id="s1048">I always let them know they were the expert.</span> <span id="s1049">All that I had were some tools and some ideas that I was willing to share with them.</span> <span id="s1050">But they had to tell me whether they fit it, they might not, and I would tell them, look, this may not be right for you.</span> <span id="s1051">Let me know, you know better than I do.</span> <span id="s1052">If we talk about something that, that you don’t, you find offensive, let me know.</span> <span id="s1053">So that it was, I was, I’ve never been the expert.</span> <span id="s1054">I mean, and I, in my work at the medical school, I’m trying to teach our medical students, that as future physicians, it’s still the patient who is the expert on the patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: That’s novel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: It’s not the physician.</span> <span id="s1057">The physician may be the expert on the disease and on some treatment but the patient is the expert on, on what’s wrong with the patient and if you don’t respect that and don’t elicit from the patient what’s going on and what they think what’s going on, you’re gonna lose three quarters of your information.</span> <span id="s1058">And particularly true in management of illness is that, always three quarters of that is within the patient’s domain.</span> <span id="s1059">Because I can’t prescribe, I mean, that’s why I will tell with my clients, I mean I can suggest that you might try this but it’s up to you to do it.</span> <span id="s1060">Now is this going to be possible for you?</span> <span id="s1061">And some of them will say, yes and I say well, how do you see yourself doing this?</span> <span id="s1062">It’s letting always your clients come up with a plan, always have them, have them come up with the ideas as much as possible about what’s gonna work for them.</span> <span id="s1063">And have them be in charge of their own healing because only then is there gonna be a chance that they will actually pursue the ideas.</span> <span id="s1064">But if I tell somebody else what to do, the chance of ‘em doing it are very small.</span> <span id="s1065">It shouldn’t, and so to that, and, but where I differ from classic counseling is that I will come up with, I will say, I won’t say a lot of counseling is how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this.</span> <span id="s1066">I, like you feel about it is only marginally useful.</span> <span id="s1067">I much more focus, okay, what are you gonna do about it.</span> <span id="s1068">I’m much more focused End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Well, it’s, it’s going back to, to my, my the difference is that, and that, that has, that goes back to my history is you need to understand how your past has impacted on you.</span> <span id="s1071">That’s critical because otherwise you remain a victim of your past.</span> <span id="s1072">But then you need to free yourself from your past as much as possible.</span> <span id="s1073">Now, I won’t ever be able to free myself completely and that’s okay because I should never forget.</span> <span id="s1074">But what I can do and what also my clients mostly need to do is they need to overcome the horrendous messages of their childhood.</span> <span id="s1075">They need to take control over their lives and so I prefer focusing on the healing process instead of on the, just ________ on the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: And, and it worked for you ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Exactly right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: And you’ve seen it work for your patients as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1080">It works unbelievably well.</span> <span id="s1081">Unbelievably well with my clients.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: And what is the actual class that you teach, at, is it U and M Medical?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I don’t teach, I don’t teach classes necessarily.</span> <span id="s1084">I teach on the behavioral scientists for the, we have a problem-based learning curriculum at our medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: A what based?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Problem-based learning.</span> <span id="s1087">It basically means that they have, it’s a modified problem-based learning so they meet in tutorial groups and there is a lot of responsibility for self learning, for hypothesizing.</span> <span id="s1088">I mean all the things, all the things that I think are important, thinking, problem-solving, analyzing and my job as the behavioral scientist, I see as my major job is to, to teach our medical students to see patients at the partners, as their partners and not as diseases because medical school is heavily biological and so our, our physicians are trained to look at the disease process and at very little else.</span> <span id="s1089">And so my major job is to keep the patient in mind, and to keep the patient as the focus and to deal with the patient as a partner and not just as the carrier of a disease.</span> <span id="s1090">And it’s very exciting and, and I’m particularly interested in the management treatment part of it where basically the patient should, we should have very different approaches.</span> <span id="s1091">Physicians have a tendency to tell patients what to do, this is what you should, without explaining much, without looking at a patient’s circumstances to see whether in effect they can one, buy the medicine, take, take the medicine.</span> <span id="s1092">Can they relax, can they adhere, do they understand what’s going on?</span> <span id="s1093">What are the pressures, what are the miseries, what are the situations at home?</span> <span id="s1094">I mean, you can tell somebody to stop smoking, well, that’s not gonna to do a bit of good.</span> <span id="s1095">You need to understand what role smoking plays in this, this person’s life.</span> <span id="s1096">And are they interested in quitting?</span> <span id="s1097">And where are they and how often have they tried?</span> <span id="s1098">So, it’s a, it’s a much of a comprehensive, patient-centered approach.</span> <span id="s1099">Very respectful of the patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Sounds awfully new to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: That’s what most people say.</span> <span id="s1102">But that’s what we are, we hope to accomplish at our medical school and we’re succeeding.</span> <span id="s1103">Our, our young, our medical students are wonderful, wonderful.</span> <span id="s1104">Not all, but most.</span> <span id="s1105">And very tuned into this.</span> <span id="s1106">It’s really, it’s wonderful to talk with them and, and see their sensitivity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: How old or new is this program?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: We’re going in our fourth year.</span> <span id="s1109">So.</span> <span id="s1110">We’re having our fourth class.</span> <span id="s1111">Our, our first class is graduating next year and they’re sort of my babies.</span> <span id="s1112">They’re, I came in with them and they’re, I’m gonna miss ‘em a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: It’s exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: It is.</span> <span id="s1115">They’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s1116">It’s a great place to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: It also sounds good on the level that I interviewed a doctor for a story I was working on recently and he said, “People don’t realize how prone physicians are to problems; drug problems, stress, enormous, enormous stress.”</span> <span id="s1118">So it sounds like perhaps this gives them some tools to work on their problems too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1120">Very nice.</span> <span id="s1121">Yes.</span> <span id="s1122">Because we expect physicians to be super-human.</span> <span id="s1123">And they’re just people, bright people on the whole, and caring people on the whole.</span> <span id="s1124">But that’s all they are.</span> <span id="s1125">And one of the great tragedies is is that in the traditional approach, our physicians are taught, it becomes, because they tend to be obsessive-compulsive, they tend to be perfectionists, they tend to be hard-driven and so on.</span> <span id="s1126">What they want to do is they want to fix things.</span> <span id="s1127">And they’re happy when they can fix something.</span> <span id="s1128">And when they can’t fix something, they get very unhappy and very stressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process when they can’t do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient.</span> <span id="s1129">Because they can’t do anymore.</span> <span id="s1130">And so you see this avoidance behavior.</span> <span id="s1131">That’s because they’re uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1132">They can’t, they can’t fix, the other focus for me is is that there is very little fixing you guys can do.</span> <span id="s1133">If you’re lucky you can cut out a, you can cure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you can do, you can do some other things that truly fix things.</span> <span id="s1134">But most of the time, it isn’t as simple as that.</span> <span id="s1135">Most of the time you just have to learn to work with your patient to make it as, to make it better.</span> <span id="s1136">But that means you need to be in partnership with your patient.</span> <span id="s1137">And don’t worry so much about fixing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: And, and don’t take all the responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Don’t take all the responsibility.</span> <span id="s1140">Leave the responsibility where it belongs but then behave in ways that you communicate that clearly.</span> <span id="s1141">I, that’s certainly what I’ve done in my counseling, always left the power with my clients.</span> <span id="s1142">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: And you learned that through your own experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1145">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1146">And, and even in my, that, that has worked so well for me because even when I was, when Loren(ph) was small and I was raising him and as he went on to high school, middle school and high school, we’d have discussions about smoking and drugs and work and I’d say, I’d, I remember saying, “Loren,”(ph), remember this conversation, “Loren(ph), do you think you’ll, you’ll”, well I knew he would never smoke.</span> <span id="s1147">Because when he was three years old, my husband’s ex-brother-in-law came who sat in this house for two days smoking two to three packs of cigarette a day, cigarettes a day and drinking all our sherry.</span> <span id="s1148">We had a bottle of sherry.</span> <span id="s1149">And smoking in the bedroom and putting the cigarette, his butts, his butts and his matches next to the bed.</span> <span id="s1150">Anyway, Loren(ph) came home from school that first day and the house was covered in smoke.</span> <span id="s1151">It was gray and he said, “Mommy, it stinks.”</span> <span id="s1152">He was three years old.</span> <span id="s1153">I said, “Yes, that’s cigarettes.”</span> <span id="s1154">He says, and I took him outside, I didn’t wanna be him, I didn’t him to be in that environment.</span> <span id="s1155">Well, I tell you, as far as he’s concerned, cigarettes have always stunk.</span> <span id="s1156">So he never smoked.</span> <span id="s1157">But then when he went to high school, I talked to him about, I said, “Loren(ph), what do you think about alcohol and drugs?</span> <span id="s1158">Do you think you’re ever going to try those things?”</span> <span id="s1159">And his response to me was, “I don’t know, how can I tell ya?”</span> <span id="s1160">I said, “Well, what do you think right now?</span> <span id="s1161">Do you think that you’re, that, do you see yourself as experimenting with, with drugs?”</span> <span id="s1162">“Well, I might.”</span> <span id="s1163">I said, “Well, Loren(ph), I just want you to know, it’s gonna be your life that you’re gonna louse up.</span> <span id="s1164">I mean, it’s gonna hurt me but it’s gonna be your life, not my life.”</span> <span id="s1165">I said, “You’ve got this magnificent brain, if you wanna destroy it, you wanna ruin it by getting into drugs, it’s gonna be your problem.</span> <span id="s1166">And I just, it’s hard for me to imagine that you would be that stupid.”</span> <span id="s1167">Left it at that.</span> <span id="s1168">Same thing with working.</span> <span id="s1169">“Loren(ph), if you decide not to work here, we’re paying a lot of tuition, if you decide, I mean, your part of the bargain is for you to, to put in your effort.</span> <span id="s1170">If you decide not to do that, I’m gonna regret it but again, you’re gonna be doing the most harm to yourself.</span> <span id="s1171">And, and, in the, I’m not interested in paying a lot of tuition for you to louse up so again, you make those decisions.”</span> <span id="s1172">So, early in the game I let him know where I stood, what my hopes were, but always leaving the responsibility with him and he got drunk once in college ‘cause he wanted to find out what getting drunk was like and that was the first and last time he did it.</span> <span id="s1173">He hated it.</span> <span id="s1174">He didn’t like being out of control.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Does he drink at all now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Barely.</span> <span id="s1177">Nope.</span> <span id="s1178">Never used drugs.</span> <span id="s1179">Never smoked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Coffee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: No.</span> <span id="s1182">Drink, does he drink coffee?</span> <span id="s1183">I know.</span> <span id="s1184">Not because, we, we offer him a glass of wine.</span> <span id="s1185">We will have some wine sometimes.</span> <span id="s1186">He doesn’t like alcohol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Interesting when you have the freedom to abuse yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: He didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s1189">He didn’t have to because he knew that, he knew that as far as we were concerned, he would punish himself the most.</span> <span id="s1190">If he was, and I used that word stupid several times.</span> <span id="s1191">I said, “If you’re gonna be that stupid or it’s hard for me to think that you would be that stupid.”</span> <span id="s1192">So, basically I expressed my total disdain for that kind of behavior.</span> <span id="s1193">That I could not imagine that somebody as bright as he, and then what I, and the other things I did with him, I always expressed my total confidence in him.</span> <span id="s1194">I just said, “Loren(ph), you’ve got this just remarkable”, even if he didn’t do well, I said, “Loren(ph)”, I said, “I just think you have the intelligence that is going to make you shine as you get older.</span> <span id="s1195">I just believe so strongly in your potential.”</span> <span id="s1196">So that even when he wasn’t, when he wasn’t working hard, wasn’t doing well I never, it was never ahhh!</span> <span id="s1197">It was just, just my total overwhelming belief in him, as just a young being of enormous value, with enormous value.</span> <span id="s1198">I wanted to give him everything I never felt or I hadn’t felt when I was his age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Or that you would have felt had it not been for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1201">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Sounds like your parents were pretty respectful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1204">Yes they were.</span> <span id="s1205">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1206">My father, even when I did so badly in Holland, what saved my life was his belief in me as an intelligent person.</span> <span id="s1207">I know that.</span> <span id="s1208">If he hadn’t been there for me, the whole time.</span> <span id="s1209">I knew that he thought I was smart.</span> <span id="s1210">Even though my, my performance absolutely denied it.</span> <span id="s1211">It was just like, and then indeed, I did better and better and better after I came to America.</span> <span id="s1212">It seems like even now I’m doing better and better and better all the time.</span> <span id="s1213">It’s amazing to me.</span> <span id="s1214">I’m continually learning.</span> <span id="s1215">My life is continually expanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Well, is part of that because you’ve recovered so, so much, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1218">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: And that you’ve worked so hard on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1221">There’s little doubt in my mind that I have freed myself from those evil messages of my past.</span> <span id="s1222">I truly have because they controlled me.</span> <span id="s1223">I truly, I truly have freed myself from those.</span> <span id="s1224">Totally.</span> <span id="s1225">Nah, that’s not true, not totally.</span> <span id="s1226">I still have some fears that I can’t get out.</span> <span id="s1227">I still, I still, when my husband doesn’t come home when I expect him to, there’s immediately, my heart just sinks.</span> <span id="s1228">I still, I’m in terror of losing him or, or my family, my child, yeah.</span> <span id="s1229">I still have that.</span> <span id="s1230">I, I don’t seem to be able to get over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: I think a lot of people have that fear about losing a loved one but do you think yours is greater?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1233">Because I can try to talk myself intellectually out of it and I just, it just, just, it just, my feelings, the feelings overwhelm me.</span> <span id="s1234">Even though, statistically, I should not worry about it.</span> <span id="s1235">But and, it’s gotten better.</span> <span id="s1236">I’m much better now than I used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Have you thought of buying them cell phones for Christmas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: No, I’m not, I’m not so worried about Loren(ph) anymore because Loren(ph) now has a, has a young woman in his life who looks after him so I have now a, and for me, instead of a threat to me, it’s a joy because there’s somebody else who loves him and who will look after him so that it’s not totally my responsibility.</span> <span id="s1239">And I just, it’s wonderful for me to know there’s somebody else there who cares about him and loves him.</span> <span id="s1240">So that’s, makes, gives me a great sense of peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1243">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Well, would you like to take a little break?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: I think that’s a great idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Okay, I’ll just go one by one.</span> <span id="s1247">I wondered when you left Holland if your family had a thought or talked at all about going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1249">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1250">No.</span> <span id="s1251">No.</span> <span id="s1252">America was always the land of opportunity.</span> <span id="s1253">A lot of the Jewish, the survivors, the Holocaust, the concentration camp survivors, I think, went to Israel and certainly after the war, the children whose parents had been killed and, in Holland, if, if they had fled to Holland from eastern European countries to escape Nazism, and, and if those parents were killed, the children were put in hiding, those children were all sent to Israel.</span> <span id="s1254">So, I’m not sure Israel ever came up for us.</span> <span id="s1255">It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Maybe you just didn’t have an opportunity or no one invited you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: No.</span> <span id="s1258">No one invited us.</span> <span id="s1259">I don’t think it even dawned on us.</span> <span id="s1260">I mean, it was going to America really was to a land of opportunity to sort of, my parents felt that there was little opportunity for us in Holland.</span> <span id="s1261">I think they just wanted to get away from it.</span> <span id="s1262">So, Israel was, I mean too much stress and tension, I mean you, after all these years, I think it would have been very hard to go to a country where that was still the midst of turmoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: And still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: And still is, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Let me move this a little bit closer.</span> <span id="s1266">Is that okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Thanks.</span> <span id="s1269">And you took a ship [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Oh yeah, the ______ I got so seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: I just wondered what that was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Awful, it just, I remember there were two other Dutch girls and fiancee, left Holland, they were just going for a visit and of course we went with my family.</span> <span id="s1273">And everything we had, my parents sold the furniture because that’s to pay for the voyage so we just had I think, 16 or 17 suitcases and boxes with us, perhaps not that many, nine, I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s1274">But that was all we had.</span> <span id="s1275">And it was amazing, it was November and it was rough and all, what I remember most from that journey was just being so sick to my stomach and throwing up in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1276">And then when we got to New York, it was sort of amazing too, ‘cause we got to New York, and Henry Coster(ph) and his wife, Peggy, happened to be in New York for, for film, to watch, to watch films or plays or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1277">And they knew when we were, when, I guess they knew that, our arrival time.</span> <span id="s1278">And, and, but we had no idea they would be there so we really had no idea what to do when we got to New York.</span> <span id="s1279">So it was really interesting.</span> <span id="s1280">We were waiting for all our luggage to get off the boat.</span> <span id="s1281">There I saw this man looking and I’d seen his picture and I went up to him and I said, “Are you Henry Coster(ph)?”</span> <span id="s1282">And he says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1283">And ‘cause he didn’t recognize us and here we were, you think a family with four children.</span> <span id="s1284">But I, I, and why, I just remembered him from his picture, so, which was, which turned out to be very nice.</span> <span id="s1285">He’d rented a big car and found us a cheap hotel.</span> <span id="s1286">So we stayed a couple of days in New York and then took the bus to St. Louis.</span> <span id="s1287">And then seven days later or four days later, I took the bus to California.</span> <span id="s1288">So, I’m taking a bus ride and coming, coming through Albuquerque for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1291">It was exciting.</span> <span id="s1292">It was hard for us to imagine what America would look like and arriving New York is so overwhelming, all these buildings.</span> <span id="s1293">One most terrifying things were the, the ambulance sirens, I mean, because they sound just like our sirens during the war and that was terrifying.</span> <span id="s1294">Every time we heard sirens, we ducked.</span> <span id="s1295">So it was really hard getting used to the, to the fire engines and the ambulances, the police cars.</span> <span id="s1296">That was the most distressing part.</span> <span id="s1297">But it was sort of amazing to be in this huge city and I can remember we would buy food and eat in our hotel room.</span> <span id="s1298">And my mother had some ancient aunts who lived in New York, we visited them.</span> <span id="s1299">Tanta(ph), they were, as a matter of fact, they were my grandfather’s sisters.</span> <span id="s1300">Tanta Rebecca(ph), Tanta Rosa(ph).</span> <span id="s1301">And, and then we, and then my mother had some distant cousins in St. Louis who had agreed to help us and so we stayed there for couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1302">My parents did and I went to California.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: I wondered also if you have, still have contact with that Jewish American soldier you met during the Liberation time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Bob Fenton(ph)?</span> <span id="s1305">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Is that his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: The one who also brought you to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1310">No, he died, he died of melanoma, I think, many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s1311">But, and his wife remarried, Mary Fenton(ph) and they moved to the east coast and I think my youngest sister, Helga, has had some contact with her but I haven’t.</span> <span id="s1312">We did, after we came to America because he lived in California and when my parents moved to California in 1958, they spent some time with him.</span> <span id="s1313">And so they were friends, they remained friends.</span> <span id="s1314">But then he, I forgot my, and then in 1965, my parents moved to Washington because that’s where I was and I think we lost contact then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: And, and how was it that you actually met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Oh, my sister, my youngest sister Helga would pick them up.</span> <span id="s1317">I, she, this was, we lived in, in this little town near Falkenburg __________, in Holland, Lindbergh(ph), and what we would do, the American soldiers, the white soldiers were, were sort of bivouacked in, in a hotel and then the blacks were right across the fields in tents.</span> <span id="s1318">And we’d go down and just sort of stand there, my mother had always told us not to ever ask for anything ‘cause that was impolite, so, American soldiers just adored us because there were cute little girls, eight, six, seven and eight.</span> <span id="s1319">And they just looked there, at the, at these soldiers and so we always ended up with the most goodies.</span> <span id="s1320">And I’m not quite sure but my youngest sister, Helga, she’d, she’d come home, she just sort of told him to come with us, so, so, one day Bob Fenton(ph) came.</span> <span id="s1321">One day she came home with a chaplain and said, “Mommy, that’s the best I could find.”</span> <span id="s1322">Good taste.</span> <span id="s1323">So, it was mostly that, it was safe, totally safe for us those days.</span> <span id="s1324">And we just sort of, I’m not quite sure in retrospect, that we just asked them to come home with us.</span> <span id="s1325">And of course they would, they loved being in a home ‘cause these poor guys had been out in a field and so on so, it was fun and it was incredible to meet Jewish soldiers ‘cause that immediately formed a tie.</span> <span id="s1326">I can remember, was another soldier named Jimmy.</span> <span id="s1327">Jimmy would knock us on our head and he also told us that the first one who learned Mary Had a Little Lamb would get ten cents.</span> <span id="s1328">I won ten cents.</span> <span id="s1329">And then, first one my father taught me, my first words in English were, he said, “If people ask you if you speak English, just answer, just, just a few words.”</span> <span id="s1330">So my, my first knowledge of English consisted of just a few words.</span> <span id="s1331">And those were the only words I knew.</span> <span id="s1332">But I learned English quickly.</span> <span id="s1333">It’s amazing how quickly we picked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: And Bob Fenton(ph), do you remember anything in particular about that friendship because it seemed lasted, it’s beyond ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Oh yes, well, what happened in those days is that the, after, they, we had were liberated these soldiers would go to, they went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1336">And they sent us packages from Germany.</span> <span id="s1337">And they went into homes and I guess stole, stole clothings.</span> <span id="s1338">For quite a while, we were clothed in German, dresses and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1339">Sort of hate the thought now but in those days, that was all we had.</span> <span id="s1340">And yeah, we just, he was just a lovely guy and he stayed in touch with us.</span> <span id="s1341">He was tall and dark hair, curly dark hair, and just warm and caring and it was just, it, it, you cannot imagine what it is like to look at soldiers and know they could kill you.</span> <span id="s1342">For four years that they were these dangerous creatures.</span> <span id="s1343">And then to get, have the Americans come and have them be your friends and your liberators and your lifesavers basically, it’s, it’s an extraordinary feeling so of course we felt all this love and warmth for American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1344">They really represented everything that was, well our life.</span> <span id="s1345">They represented our life to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: And a Jewish soldier probably himself felt quite a bit, knowing what, what Jews had been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: I’m not sure, that was before they went into Germany, was 1944.</span> <span id="s1348">I’m not sure they, those soldiers knew.</span> <span id="s1349">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1350">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1351">That was before they liberated the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1352">I think Auschwitz, the, the Soviets liberated Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1353">So I don’t think the Americans were as aware.</span> <span id="s1354">I think the first German concentration camp, camp liberated was Dachau and then Bergen-Belsen by the British.</span> <span id="s1355">Was a while I think before the Americans just recognized, whether they even, whether these soldiers actually knew, I doubt, I mean the government and other people knew but I’m not sure the soldiers knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: And the media wasn’t [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: They missed the news story of the century, didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Which could have possibly changed the ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yes, it could have, yes it could have.</span> <span id="s1362">I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Well that’s another cause for deep and long rumination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: How did you happen to choose Russian studies as a ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s1367">Well, I was at Washington University and I remember my first major was chemistry and that didn’t work out so well.</span> <span id="s1368">I decided I wasn’t a born chemist.</span> <span id="s1369">And then I went to French, and then one day I took a political science course and sometimes you just hit your love and I just absolutely became enchanted with political science and I was already a junior in college.</span> <span id="s1370">And I was just fascinated by the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1371">It was my first course with international relations course and I became fascinated by the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1372">And I’m trying to think why.</span> <span id="s1373">I, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1374">In retrospect the, it was a country that was mysterious, they were, this was in the fifties, I went to college in ’54 to ’58.</span> <span id="s1375">So that was the height of the Cold War.</span> <span id="s1376">And I think it just grabbed my attention perhaps because of my experiences during the war as it was Nazi power, with the Nazi Germany as a great power, that perhaps, perhaps I felt that understanding the Soviet Union better might help me do something worthwhile or some, something like that.</span> <span id="s1377">It was certainly not because I had any Communist interest.</span> <span id="s1378">It was truly because the Soviet Union represented danger I think and, and another great power and fascination.</span> <span id="s1379">And then I, then I went to Harvard in the Russian Studies program and I was, and I was right because it was a wonderful choice because it’s a, it’s a, has an unbelievable history.</span> <span id="s1380">Russian history is, is unbelievable history.</span> <span id="s1381">And the Russian, and I spent a lot of time in the Soviet Union and the Russian people are remarkable people in many ways so it, it, intuitively I, I just picked the right country to be particularly interested in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: That’s great.</span> <span id="s1383">That also leads to another question about what you did for the Rand(ph) Corporation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: I did research on Soviet Military and Foreign Affairs.</span> <span id="s1385">I actually read Pravda and _______, the papers and translated articles and really tried to come up with themes and sort of whether we could learn anything from the open press.</span> <span id="s1386">But I was a research assistant to senior researchers in, in Soviet foreign and military affairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: What does the Rand(ph) Corporation do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Well, they, they were the research organization for the Air Force really.</span> <span id="s1389">And they primarily did military, they did primarily military and economic and foreign policy research for the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1390">It was sort of, it was the research arm of the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1391">Now they’ve expanded.</span> <span id="s1392">They, they do a lot of research in health areas.</span> <span id="s1393">I still think that their major contractor is the Air Force but they’ve, they do, they do superb research.</span> <span id="s1394">They attracts very high caliber people and but now they’ve expanded to research in education, research on health issues, research on public welfare issues and prison, prison systems.</span> <span id="s1395">They, they tend to do massive studies.</span> <span id="s1396">They, drug, drug intervention studies.</span> <span id="s1397">So they’ve expanded far away a focus on international and, and foreign affairs issues of, in China, Russia, Europe.</span> <span id="s1398">I mean they, they cover the whole field to, to now also national issues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: And did you speak Russian as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1401">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1402">That’s what we studied, I studied at Harvard.</span> <span id="s1403">And then I spent, I spent about ten and a half months in the Soviet Union as a guide in American exhibit.</span> <span id="s1404">That certainly helped my Russian a lot.</span> <span id="s1405">But tragically, I’ve forgotten most of it now because I haven’t used it in so long but one of the great experiences in my life was being a guide on a, on a U.S., part of the U.S. - Soviet cultural exchange program.</span> <span id="s1406">Incredible experience.</span> <span id="s1407">That’s where I met Elizabeth Dixon, was in, in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1408">Was it Moscow or Leningrad?</span> <span id="s1409">Leningrad, was Leningrad, were in Leningrad.</span> <span id="s1410">[talkover] Near St. Petersburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Americans would come over and you would show them around and talk about the history ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: No, Americans, Russians.</span> <span id="s1413">This was a U.S., a U.S. sponsored exhibit, American exhibit in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1414">So we’d speak to Russians.</span> <span id="s1415">They’d come and see the wonders of, of America and one of the great experiences, I’ll never forget and of course this was still in the early sixties, still the Cold War was raging.</span> <span id="s1416">One of the, several very powerful experiences there.</span> <span id="s1417">One was a man came and he was a, he was a Party member and he was telling us about the glories of the Soviet Union and he was seemed exceedingly nice and he asked us about the United States and he asked about unemployment and racism and we were very open about...</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">[End of side one of tape 3]</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Could you go back to you were open about the [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: That, they would ask a lot about the negative things: unemployment, racism, discrimination, poverty, etc., etc., and we’d, we’d very, were very open about that unlike the Soviets where everything had to be perfect.</span> <span id="s1421">But yes, that we had those issues but the way it had been, it was so interesting, on the one hand they were told that they must overtake the United States.</span> <span id="s1422">On the other hand they were told what a terrible country America was.</span> <span id="s1423">Now it’s pretty hard to overtake a country that is so terrible so there was some internal, were some internal contradictions.</span> <span id="s1424">But anyway, this guy came and so he asked, he was very kind and he asked all these sort of questions about unemployment and yeah.</span> <span id="s1425">I talked with him and then I happened to see him outside of the exhibit hall in, in, sort of on the stairs.</span> <span id="s1426">And we started to talk and it turns out, he’s told me he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1427">And I said, “Well, I’m Jewish, too.”</span> <span id="s1428">He said, “You are?”</span> <span id="s1429">And it was just like this total change came, came over him and he said, “Is there really unemployment in America?</span> <span id="s1430">Is there really any racism ?”</span> <span id="s1431">I mean, it’s just like he’s, talk the party line but then when it came to trusting me because he felt that he could, it was just like questioning everything.</span> <span id="s1432">So that was sort of, yeah, and I said, “yes, we do,” but, I, I tried to put in context of yes, there is racism but there’s also something we’re working on.</span> <span id="s1433">Yes, there is unemployment but people are not just out in the streets starving to death, we have unemployment.</span> <span id="s1434">I mean just trying to put an end to, and there’s yes, there is poverty.</span> <span id="s1435">I mean, we’ve got all the problems but you look, anyway.</span> <span id="s1436">And so that was, that was sort of a nice story and then another, one of the most touching stories was in, in, I think it was in Leningrad, it was in Leningrad again.</span> <span id="s1437">The first one was in Moscow, the second one was in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg.</span> <span id="s1438">Where a woman came and wanted a San Francisco phone book and, and I gave her the phone book and she looked up some addresses and, and then disappeared.</span> <span id="s1439">Just before the exhibit closed, the same woman came back and her face was just beaming.</span> <span id="s1440">She was absolutely, she said, “I found my sister.”</span> <span id="s1441">And she, her sister had left, also Jewish.</span> <span id="s1442">The sister had left for the United States before the war and she hadn’t heard from her in, that was, this was now ’65, in 25 years.</span> <span id="s1443">And she’d found her sister’s name in the phone book, had telegrammed her or called her and she sent, she showed me the telegram from her sister.</span> <span id="s1444">I, I, she said, “Overjoyed at hearing from you.”</span> <span id="s1445">So it brought, and it, couple of times, some Russians, particularly Jews, found relatives that had gone to America because we had phone books from all over the country, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Yeah and amazing stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Did you feel a particular warmth for the Russian people having sacrificed so much during World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1450">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1451">And I think they felt that warmth with me because I could understand them.</span> <span id="s1452">I mean, what, what they had suffered was beyond imagination.</span> <span id="s1453">And so I think they could feel from me my enormous sympathy for them.</span> <span id="s1454">And whereas for most Americans they did not know Russian history as much nor did they understand the horrors, particularly what Leningrad went through.</span> <span id="s1455">Leningrad and Kiev turned out that both exhibits went to Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad.</span> <span id="s1456">And Kiev also was just destroyed and of course in Kiev we had the, the horrendous massacre of the Jews at Babiy Yar.</span> <span id="s1457">And so we went to Babiy Yar and, and it was interesting that particularly the, in Kiev, the survivors, the, the Jewish survivors connected strongly with those of us, we didn’t have too many Jews in the exhibit, but connected strongly with those of us who were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1458">And it was, it was, it was a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s1459">It was a real connector.</span> <span id="s1460">It just transcended, being Jewish transcended nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: And the Cold War?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: And the, and the, and the Cold War.</span> <span id="s1463">It certainly transcended the Cold War, no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: That’s lovely.</span> <span id="s1465">I wonder if you had any continuing fears that are kind of left over scars or wounds from the war.</span> <span id="s1466">Like you said you feared when your husband was late, do you still or does a knock on the door ever trigger a fear or a siren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1468">Not those things.</span> <span id="s1469">And I, and I don’t have any idea whether this is fear-related or whether this related to the war but whereas intellectually I’m totally comfortable with making mistakes, emotionally, when people disapprove of something that I’ve done or angry with me, it still gives me a pang of ahhhh.</span> <span id="s1470">But I get over that very quickly.</span> <span id="s1471">It is, but I, but I think that is so common to most of us women and to most people that I’m not sure where that’s a remnant of the war years or whether that is, that is a, whether, whether that is just part of being, most, few of us sort of like to be corrected or, or criticized or disapproved of so, I think, I still, there’s part of me that still wants to please others even though intellectually I know that’s not what I should be doing.</span> <span id="s1472">But I know a large part of me is still is into, I mean little things.</span> <span id="s1473">I will be talking to somebody and I won’t ever be the first one to walk away.</span> <span id="s1474">Just always being aware of who else is involved and including them, it’s, somebody says you wanna do that, instead of saying no I can’t, I will say I can, I’ll try.</span> <span id="s1475">It’s that still, I still, part of me still tries to please more than I’m comfortable with.</span> <span id="s1476">I think that’s part of the war.</span> <span id="s1477">I, I still think that’s part of the old me.</span> <span id="s1478">But that’s, that’s about it.</span> <span id="s1479">Those are not necessarily bad, bad things.</span> <span id="s1480">No fears, driving sometimes, I worry about my husband’s driving, and I’m always but that’s common.</span> <span id="s1481">No, it’s amazing, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1482">My mother did but I don’t.</span> <span id="s1483">That’s one of the great blessings of having been a child.</span> <span id="s1484">I didn’t integrate, at least I did not integrate the horror of the war, I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s1485">I, that’s not fair.</span> <span id="s1486">I, not the way I would have as an adult because I, as now, I’m totally aware of what happened but as a child all I knew that I would be killed if they discovered if, which is a heavy thing for a child to live with.</span> <span id="s1487">But I did not understand everything else that was going on.</span> <span id="s1488">That was not until much later.</span> <span id="s1489">So, thank God I didn’t, I, it’s beyond my understanding how concentration camp survivors can live with all their memories.</span> <span id="s1490">It’s, it’s unbearable and for some it’s so unbearable that, in effect, it’s, I’ve heard one of my friends who survived four concentration camps including, as a matter of fact he’s a Schindler, he was on Schindler’s list for a while.</span> <span id="s1491">He’s a Schindler Jew.</span> <span id="s1492">And he survived the Auschwitz and I think Dachau-Bookenvalt(ph) and he says, “I didn’t survive.”</span> <span id="s1493">And I totally understand that.</span> <span id="s1494">Totally understand that.</span> <span id="s1495">He’s living, he lives still.</span> <span id="s1496">But you don’t survive that.</span> <span id="s1497">So I’m intensely grateful that I don’t have to live with those horrendous memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: I’ve also noticed and, and again I don’t know if this is related at all to the Holocaust or this is just your family, but it seems like there’s an extraordinary number of people in your close family who are in caring professions like medicine, nursing ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Psychiatry, helping, helping, helping.</span> <span id="s1501">Is that just a family trait or is that at all a war and Holocaust related do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Huh.</span> <span id="s1503">You’re absolutely right.</span> <span id="s1504">I have, I think, I think that is in generally true, that’s generally true for Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1505">Many have gone to the helping professions, many have become therapists are staggering, I mean effort to understand the self is to help others.</span> <span id="s1506">Yeah, you wanna do something to make it, to make this a better world.</span> <span id="s1507">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1508">Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1509">I mean, initially I wasn’t, but I’ve ended up in a helping profession.</span> <span id="s1510">But even trying to understand the Soviet Union for me was trying to understand something that posed a threat, I think in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: And perhaps gives you a measure of control ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Yeah, yeah, understand your enemy.</span> <span id="s1513">Yes.</span> <span id="s1514">And I think that’s, that’s true for many Holocaust survivors, that that’s, that’s, that’s been an area that has been a source of comfort for them is to go into the quote helping professions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: But even then their children too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1517">Well, they get in, inoculated by us.</span> <span id="s1518">Yeah, because my sister, my sister’s, my youngest sister has one physician and one medical anthropologist, one nurse and one molecular biologist.</span> <span id="s1519">And she’s got two PhD, and an MD and a nurse in her, as her four children and my middle sister has a nurse, I mean has a medical student, and a, be a doctor, and her other daughter wants to be a nursery school teacher and then, my son, I’m not sure, he wants to just figure out how the brain works.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: That could be helpful to humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Yeah, perhaps, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: But on a very intellectual high plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Very high plane, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Probably higher than my own capacity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Oh, way beyond mine, way beyond mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: When you were babysitting for the Costers,(ph), I wondered if you actually worked for free and, or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: I got twelve dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1528">I got room and board and twelve dollars a week, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: And I don’t know what the wages were in those days so is that what regular babysitters got, do you know?</span> <span id="s1530">Or is that, was there a little bit of payback for his helping to sponsor you guys to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Again, I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s1532">I’m, I mean they paid for my room and board.</span> <span id="s1533">I mean I, I lived there and that didn’t cost my anything and I could save some money, I didn’t spend any money.</span> <span id="s1534">Sometimes they bought me clothes.</span> <span id="s1535">I never, to be honest, you know what, I never questioned it.</span> <span id="s1536">And twelve dollars in those days was pretty good and I cannot tell you, I mean, babysitting, you paid babysitters fifty, fifty cents an hour so I think that probably was not an unreasonable amount.</span> <span id="s1537">Was a good deal for them because it gave them the freedom to go out and not have to worry about babysitters for their two boys who were six and nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Then your parents didn’t mind giving up their own babysitter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: I wasn’t a babysitter, I mean my, my sisters were, I was 16, almost 17, they were 14 and 15 so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: They didn’t need you for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: No, not, oh, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1542">They, well past that.</span> <span id="s1543">Besides my parents were, they, they got jobs but girls went to school and my brother joined the Air Force right away and they were home.</span> <span id="s1544">I mean they, they were home in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: I guess I’m just a little bit surprised that you went so far away from your family so soon in America since you also expressed earlier today how much you determined to stay with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1547">Again was a, I think it was a real mistake that I did it.</span> <span id="s1548">In retrospect I shouldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s1549">But they thought it was a great opportunity for me and I did what was expected of me.</span> <span id="s1550">It was just, in a way it was an adventure, going to Beverly Hills, California.</span> <span id="s1551">And again, I did, I did what I was supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1552">I didn’t question, I wasn’t, I mean when I look at my own son and all his questioning and all his rebellion and all his, well not so much rebellion but certainly insistence on doing his own thing, I, that wasn’t my style.</span> <span id="s1553">I did what was asked of me and I did it.</span> <span id="s1554">I didn’t ask whether it was good for me, I just, they wanted one of us to come and so I was the oldest girl, I was the obvious one, obvious and by far the most mature one.</span> <span id="s1555">Although I was so, naïve and innocent, I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: But it was safe too, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: And again, all the good food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Oh that food, the ice cream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: You discovered Baskin Robbins?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: I don’t think Baskin Robbins, Robbins had been discovered yet.</span> <span id="s1562">No but they had a freezer with ice cream.</span> <span id="s1563">I couldn’t believe anybody having ice cream at home.</span> <span id="s1564">We’d had no refrigerator in Holland.</span> <span id="s1565">We had a little gas stove.</span> <span id="s1566">I mean, goodness gracious, you come from little tiny Holland to this mansion with a butler and maid and aye, aye, aye.</span> <span id="s1567">What a culture shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Opulence after so much deprivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Oh unbelievable, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1570">Mind-blowing, ridiculous, overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Have you done very much reading and studying about the war and the Holocaust since then to try and get more understanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yes, yeah, got lots of books.</span> <span id="s1573">It’s interesting, I find it harder and harder to do so.</span> <span id="s1574">It just, in my, I think my rage has intensified.</span> <span id="s1575">That doesn’t sound consistent with what I’ve said because I’m, I’m not, I’m not guided by that rage, I’m not controlled by that rage.</span> <span id="s1576">But when I read about it, it just, my incomprehension just increases.</span> <span id="s1577">I cannot imagine, I cannot imagine this actually happening and the older I get I think you sort of have, your child is grown, you’ve done, you’ve, you’re sort of at a pretty stable level and you can think back on, on life and put it more in perspective and the more I try to put it in perspective, the more incomprehensible it becomes.</span> <span id="s1578">So I find myself, I, I just find it harder and harder to, to read about it and to certainly to see, to see the films.</span> <span id="s1579">They’re just unbearable.</span> <span id="s1580">Instead of getting easier, gets, gets harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Oh, I can imagine that, I think that makes sense.</span> <span id="s1582">I mean certainly a person’s not gonna grow more tolerant of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: No, exact opposite [talkover].</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Reinforces the horror and the anger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Yeah, incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s1586">That people let this happen, that it did happen.</span> <span id="s1587">And that I keep on thinking of the million and a half children who never had a chance.</span> <span id="s1588">And what this world would have been like if they had been allowed to live because the potential, the unbelievable potential of that population.</span> <span id="s1589">And they just annihilated it.</span> <span id="s1590">And all these millions were deprived of living and experiencing love and affection.</span> <span id="s1591">And the other thing I think about is I, I cannot bear to think and this happened, this became stronger after, after Loren(ph) was born.</span> <span id="s1592">It’s just, I cannot imagine what it must have been like for parents to see their children gassed.</span> <span id="s1593">And I, I just, it, it’s, or to live with the horrendous fear of what was gonna happen to them.</span> <span id="s1594">It’s beyond my comprehension.</span> <span id="s1595">I think about that a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: I, I think you’re right.</span> <span id="s1597">I think the world would have been a different place.</span> <span id="s1598">We lost all kinds of gifted people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: All sorts.</span> <span id="s1600">All sorts.</span> <span id="s1601">In Europe, in the horror in some way, Hitler, Hitler succeeded you see.</span> <span id="s1602">He made Europe youdenrine(ph), free of Jews.</span> <span id="s1603">That was his, his major aim.</span> <span id="s1604">And it’s not totally free of Jews.</span> <span id="s1605">I mean, Holland has about 35,000 Jews we think out of a population of 16 million.</span> <span id="s1606">They used to have ten percent about of its population was Jewish, not it’s just a tiny percentage.</span> <span id="s1607">French has, France has what, half a million Jews, I don’t know, probably not that much, what 50 thousand Jews, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1608">Germany has a few, Poland has practically none and Poland had three million before the war, so.</span> <span id="s1609">I mean, they, they succeeded.</span> <span id="s1610">They really succeeded.</span> <span id="s1611">And I think the Europe is the poorer for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Well also if intolerance has grown enormously because of that, that’s another repercussions, I’m, I’m sure the repercussions and the ripples of what was lost in some ways go on and on and on, if you keep thinking about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1614">It doesn’t end.</span> <span id="s1615">It doesn’t end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: And it’s all hypothetical ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Because you don’t know what those other people would have contributed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: But all that you can do is look at the survivors and what they have accomplished which is pretty, pretty impressive.</span> <span id="s1620">I look at my own family and I look at my cousins and you look at the children and it’s incredible who these children are.</span> <span id="s1621">We know the children of the children who survived.</span> <span id="s1622">It’s just, they are incredible people and we’re just a tiny percentage.</span> <span id="s1623">I mean, they’re real contributors to society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: How many survivors were there, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: In Europe, Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: It depended on the country.</span> <span id="s1628">Holland lost, I think, 80 percent of its Jews.</span> <span id="s1629">France lost about, France and Germany didn’t lose that many.</span> <span id="s1630">In Germany, many of ‘em emigrated, thank God.</span> <span id="s1631">Russia lost, Poland lost three million.</span> <span id="s1632">Poland lost almost 95 percent of its Jews and that was a heavily, the heaviest population of Jews was in eastern, really was in Europe and, and western Russia.</span> <span id="s1633">And they lost I think that, from the west, probably like, well probably couple of hundred thousand.</span> <span id="s1634">I’ve got the numbers actually, I’ve got the, got a book with all the numbers of, but I, at least half the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s1635">At least half the population of European Jews was killed and then a quarter, the rest emigrated.</span> <span id="s1636">So what’s left is just perhaps a quarter, if that many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Yeah, I have a, a wonderful book that, that I read too but I’m not very good at remembering numbers and I just all of a sudden realized that I’d, in some ways always concentrated on the numbers of the victims and the lost people rather than the ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1639">[talkover] I think they killed, they killed at least half.</span> <span id="s1640">I think there were about 11 million Jews.</span> <span id="s1641">They killed 6 million of us.</span> <span id="s1642">So perhaps 5 million survived.</span> <span id="s1643">They survived in Russia itself, in Moscow, Kiev, not Kiev, but Moscow, Leningrad.</span> <span id="s1644">Cause Leningrad lost over a hundred thousand people because of the, the blockade.</span> <span id="s1645">Many of whom were Jews.</span> <span id="s1646">But, but Russia must have lost, I’m sure, over a million Jews, at least.</span> <span id="s1647">Then Lithuania, all those and ‘course in those countries were just violently anti-Semitic, Lithuanians, Latvians, Ukrainians, awful, just horrible.</span> <span id="s1648">Awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Going back in time [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: What did you do when you were associate director of the Clearinghouse on Higher Education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: I started it.</span> <span id="s1655">I, I, that, for nine months I, that was part of the Eric(ph) System, the clearinghouse system that the Office of Education started then, started one higher education and I, I was the associate director.</span> <span id="s1656">I had no director so I got the whole thing going.</span> <span id="s1657">So that was really my major job there was to get the documents.</span> <span id="s1658">What it does it gets the unpublished documents in education and puts them, and makes them available through publications.</span> <span id="s1659">And so what it meant, was that’s how I met my husband, actually.</span> <span id="s1660">On one of those trips.</span> <span id="s1661">I had to, I traveled to various universities and, who had lots of publications and got ‘em all into the Eric(ph) System and published the abstracts and the syllabi and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1662">Was fun.</span> <span id="s1663">Great job, lots of travel, met my husband so what more and then I, and I only stayed there for nine day, for nine months because then I, I met Alan.</span> <span id="s1664">I started it in September, I met Alan in October and got married the following May so I’m afraid that I was a, my great job but not a very long-lasting job.</span> <span id="s1665">But I got a director just before I left so that was perfect.</span> <span id="s1666">I, got the stuff, got the thing going and then was able to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: And did you meet him here in Albuquerque?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: You came out here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: On my one day trip to Albuquerque.</span> <span id="s1671">The president of UNM, the University of New Mexico was giving a dinner for our group and Alan had just come here as a new psychiatrist for the department and a, and he was invited to this party also because he was a new faculty member and he had been widowed and we met at this party.</span> <span id="s1672">It was just amazing and we started to talk and I fully expected him to say oh gee, I’ve gotta go see so and so.</span> <span id="s1673">He didn’t.</span> <span id="s1674">I had no interest in meeting somebody else.</span> <span id="s1675">So we sort of talked and he wrote and eventually I wrote back and I visited him and I visited him again and that was it.</span> <span id="s1676">It was very quick.</span> <span id="s1677">And I was, let’s see, 1968, so almost 28 years ago.</span> <span id="s1678">Amazing, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s1680">And, and it sounds like the marriage has been really good for all of your feeling ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: Yeah, perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: and blossoming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Oh no, not a perfect marriage.</span> <span id="s1684">But it’s been, I, I don’t think I would have done as well with anybody else that, that Alan was just pretty much the ideal person in terms of letting me become the person, I think I’m, I, I think that who I am today was exactly the potential that I had as a two-year-old and, and it just has been allowed to blossom.</span> <span id="s1685">And that may sound very, very self-serving but I like who I am today.</span> <span id="s1686">I am very content with the person who I am and I like what I’m doing and I like how I feel.</span> <span id="s1687">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1688">And I’m in control of my life and it’s, it’s a good feeling of being where you wanna be and being who you wanna be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: And it’s a even greater accomplishment considering what happened during the Holocaust and afterwards, don’t you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Yeah, oh yeah, because who I was after the Holocaust, after the war was the exact, in some ways the exact opposite of who I am today.</span> <span id="s1691">I was scared, terrified, no self-esteem, just, just, just, just, just totally defined by the world outside of me and, and no sense of self at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: And even Betty Booka(ph) is that her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Didn’t she tell you that you had changed a lot, the first time she saw you after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1696">After the war, yes.</span> <span id="s1697">Because those changes, you see during the war, it was, it was totally different but after the war, yeah, she told me after she came to, she came to visit us in America as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1698">She said she felt I’d changed a lot and was clearly, she wasn’t happy with my changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Too bad she couldn’t see you now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Well, I, she saw me after we were married.</span> <span id="s1701">I was pregnant with Loren(ph).</span> <span id="s1702">We visited, the last time I saw her I think was ’72 and it was wonderful to see her then and I think she saw that, as a matter of fact she commented I was back to her old Leesha(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Right, and, and, so she in some ways still called you Leesha(ph) which was your ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Yeah, yeah, was my hidden name, well the, my name in hiding.</span> <span id="s1705">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1706">Old Leesha(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Just a couple more things.</span> <span id="s1708">When you worked in child development and family relations, what was your concentration or was there a sort of a something that especially you [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1710">Family relationships, marriage, child development, infant development.</span> <span id="s1711">It was, it was the developmental interactional part of, that I, that I focused on.</span> <span id="s1712">So I taught a lot of courses on marriage and personal development and on family interaction and on child development and on, some on communication and infant growth and development.</span> <span id="s1713">Oh, human growth seminars and human growth and development.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: And was that, was your interest in that at all related to perhaps your own experiences as a child, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Well, again, I, I sort of, I think I’m the kind of person who’s easily interested in what goes on around her and so after I married Alan and I was thinking now what am I gonna do with my life and my masters in Russian Studies didn’t help me much here in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</span> <span id="s1716">I decided well I’m go back to school and basically I got pregnant and went back to school at exactly the same time.</span> <span id="s1717">And just started taking child development courses and fell in love with those like I’d like fallen in love with Russian foreign policy.</span> <span id="s1718">I just found them fascinating and I’ve never taken a psychology course at Washington University so, it was just a whole new world opening for me.</span> <span id="s1719">So again, it just, I found something else that interested me.</span> <span id="s1720">I think that’s how my life is.</span> <span id="s1721">I’m, I’m easily interested in what’s going on in the world so, I, I’ve lots of, I get excited about a whole bunch of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: And you had obviously just starting your family [talkover]</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: It was perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: A nice...</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: It was perfect, absolutely perfect.</span> <span id="s1726">I remember as Loren(ph) was growing up, keeping track of whether he was on target or not.</span> <span id="s1727">Thank heavens he tended to be on target.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Did you let him know how he was doing as he went along?</span> <span id="s1729">Did you say, when he spoke his first word did you say good, Loren(ph), you’re a month ahead of schedule?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: No, but it was very clear to me from the very beginning that he clearly was a very bright child so I was a very proud obnoxious mother, I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1731">He, and I encouraged that enormously, interesting.</span> <span id="s1732">That’s certainly part of my heritage is that I didn’t care if he was an athlete or not, at all.</span> <span id="s1733">I couldn’t have cared less.</span> <span id="s1734">What I did care about was his intellectual development.</span> <span id="s1735">And if he had wanted to punish me all he would have had to do is flunk out of school.</span> <span id="s1736">Because for me, education has been the absolutely essential ingredient for taking control of life and, and so when he was developing into this incredibly delightful bright kid, End of Tape 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Could you just say that again about what he, he turned out to be as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: [talkover] He turned out to be exactly the kind of child that I had hoped for.</span> <span id="s1740">I mean, I don’t think I could have designed a child more to my dreams than Loren(ph) actually turned out to be, so what a fortunate parent I am.</span> <span id="s1741">I give him 95 percent of the credit, I’ll take about five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: How much does Alan get?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Alan gets, well, he, he’s included the 95.</span> <span id="s1744">Alan gets five, I get five and Loren(ph) gets 90.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1746">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s1747">I think that might be, oh, I, just I think this is it but I, I wanted to just ask you to talk about something we talked about before we started the tape and that was your, what you like about America being a self-examining society of sorts.</span> <span id="s1748">Would you mind ending with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1750">Well, I think that, that’s really significant from my perspective and that is that one of the great blessings from my perspective about this country is, is that we’ve made a lot of mistakes.</span> <span id="s1751">You and I talked a little bit before we put the tape on, we talked a little bit about America’s role during the war and the fact that the State Department had lots of anti-Semites in it and, and that this country knew, the government knew was happening to Jews and didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1752">That I think Roosevelt tried, there, absolutely no support for it, that the Jewish Underground begged the British and Americans who bombed the rail lines and the concentration camps and that, there were no bombs available or some excuses were given why that couldn’t be done.</span> <span id="s1753">And how many lives could have been saved if, if some relatively simple measures had been taken.</span> <span id="s1754">And that then of course then America invited all these Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von Braun(ph), that was the guy, to come to America and, and to work on the weapons programs here.</span> <span id="s1755">And we’ve hidden, I mean, we still, we’re discovering Nazis left and right still.</span> <span id="s1756">It’s pretty late now.</span> <span id="s1757">So I think this, and of course the, the horror of not letting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left Hamburg I think or Bramen(ph) on the, the ship, St. Louis and they were refused entry here and had to go back to an, to Germany or taken to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1758">So, this country has no, has not an unblemished record, far from it in many ways.</span> <span id="s1759">And that is I think, true in Europe.</span> <span id="s1760">I, I, I think there isn’t, Denmark perhaps, Denmark really had a small number of Jews and they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed.</span> <span id="s1761">They, as a country, get a lot of credit.</span> <span id="s1762">And, and I, I expect the, I accept the fact that we all make mistakes but what I cannot accept is that we don’t acknowledge our mistakes.</span> <span id="s1763">I think one of the great blessings of this country is, is we, we allow, we encourage ourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot of self-criticism going on.</span> <span id="s1764">And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we have a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past and to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didn’t behave appropriately.</span> <span id="s1765">And one of the things that has been so missing in Europe has been that honest self-examination.</span> <span id="s1766">And, and you even know it, you go to the museum in Paris, the war museum and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French is just enough to, to appall anybody.</span> <span id="s1767">And that is a, if you look at their museum, it’s as if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war.</span> <span id="s1768">There is absolutely nothing about French treachery.</span> <span id="s1769">There’s nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1770">There’s nothing about the police’s happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying Jews, there is nothing of that in France.</span> <span id="s1771">Only now are they coming to terms with it.</span> <span id="s1772">In Holland also, Holland is better.</span> <span id="s1773">It’s now beginning to examine its past but it’s taken them so long.</span> <span id="s1774">For the longest time Holland had this, whenever I talked about Holland not having been so, such a glorious country during the war, people said surprised, “Oh, I thought they were so noble.”</span> <span id="s1775">Cause Holland fostered that.</span> <span id="s1776">We the noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1777">Well they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1778">Some did.</span> <span id="s1779">But no whole population can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one of the great poisonous, and, and I must admit I think that’s where western Germany has, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who, who are aware of how vital it’s been to examine their past.</span> <span id="s1780">But overall, it’s taken them a long time, too.</span> <span id="s1781">And where in eastern Germany, this hasn’t happened at all.</span> <span id="s1782">And where you see these, these fascist movements rising.</span> <span id="s1783">You see it in France, you see it in Germany.</span> <span id="s1784">It’s, it’s scary to me.</span> <span id="s1785">And so, from my perspective that’s something that we never must stop doing.</span> <span id="s1786">We need to always reexamine our past.</span> <span id="s1787">We need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need to learn and I applaud this country that, that looks at itself and says, you know what, that stank.</span> <span id="s1788">That was no good.</span> <span id="s1789">Many of us, it takes a long while to change, but this is, this is a country that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy.</span> <span id="s1790">Eventually, he was brought down.</span> <span id="s1791">Eventually, we had people of courage who, who brought him down even while this country was scared.</span> <span id="s1792">And we need to make sure that we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people because of this irrational fear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red Menace, and it’s just, it’s just dangerous.</span> <span id="s1793">And so allowing dissent and allowing disagreement and examining ourselves all the time, I think is what’s gonna keep this country on a reasonably healthy path.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: And at least acceptance that terrible persecution has occurred and recognizing that that was a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Oh, oh you mean in its own history.</span> <span id="s1796">Oh sure, I mean slavery and the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1797">Yes, I mean terrible, terrible things have happened in this country.</span> <span id="s1798">Without question.</span> <span id="s1799">And, and but the critical, it wouldn’t, that would be even worse if we didn’t acknowledge our horrendous mistakes and try to make sure that those things don’t happen again.</span> <span id="s1800">And that doesn’t mean that we’re not gonna continue to have misery and racism because I’m not that optimistic about people to be very honest.</span> <span id="s1801">I’m just not.</span> <span id="s1802">But I think that’s where our government needs to take strong stands about people’s individual rights and privileges and responsibilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Does it scare you at all when you see some of the recent terrorist bombings of say the Olympics and the airliner and so on that then civil liberties will be curbed to try to protect the population at large?</span> <span id="s1804">Are there any possible innocent victims?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Yeah, that’s such a interesting question.</span> <span id="s1806">To be honest, I see no infringement of my rights if there’re gonna be tracers in these fertilizer things.</span> <span id="s1807">That, as far as I’m concerned, is only sensible.</span> <span id="s1808">And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that doesn’t, we can exaggerate those potential dangers.</span> <span id="s1809">And that’s something that really bothers me.</span> <span id="s1810">You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it and say what if, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1811">And so I think we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve our liberties but there’s also something like the common good.</span> <span id="s1812">And we must at all times weigh the common good against the protection of individual liberties.</span> <span id="s1813">And I don’t think it’s just a one-way street.</span> <span id="s1814">I, I have a firm commitment to the common good, also, and to my, in my opinion, and that’s why with gun-control, I am so strongly for gun-control.</span> <span id="s1815">I just, just that, this society is so violent and you see it, you see these 12 year old killing each other and killing others.</span> <span id="s1816">It’s just, it’s insanity to, to scream about, from my perspective, about everybody’s right to, to bear guns versus the, the community’s rights to some, to a sense of safety.</span> <span id="s1817">So again, a balance never, I see that generally is the answer to most of life’s problems is to find a balance that takes into account both the common and individual rights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: And that will be continued forever, all those discussions of balance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Thank you, Anita, it was really fascinating to hear you talk.</span> <span id="s1821">Really appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: Just shows what a blabbermouth I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Conclusion of interview.</span></p></body></html>
