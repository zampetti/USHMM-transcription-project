the French – German border, on the German side and the place was called Wittlich and I was there from 1921 until 1937 – at the end of 1936, we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your education in Wittlich?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: I was there three or four years.</span> <span id="s6">I don’t remember that exactly in the Jewish Volkschule and from there I had to go to private school and it was a Catholic Lyceum.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: When you say you went to the Jewish Volkschule, what was the Jewish population of Wittlich?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: There was actually a big Jewish population.</span> <span id="s9">The city had about 7 to 8 thousand people and there were about 80 Jewish families which was quite an amount for a small town like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Were these 80 families all members of one congregation or...</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s12">There was just one congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Was it orthodox or liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: No.</span> <span id="s15">It was really very conservative synagogue and the teacher was a rabbi and the cantor – he was everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Was this Jewish Volkschule affiliated with the congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s18">I think in this part of Germany each religion had it’s own Volkschule which you had to attend whether you were Catholic, Jewish or Protestant and from there on you could go to a hoehere schule – it’s not really our high school – it’s a private school, or you could go on in the Jewish school for eight years but I went to a Catholic school besides there were very few Jewish children at my age left.</span> <span id="s19">There were a few younger ones and a few older ones but just my age, there were very few children.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: When did you start to attend this hoehere schule?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Probably from 1927 until 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: That’s when you went to the Jewish school and after that you...</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: And then I went to a Catholic parochial school – this was an Ursaline order and here I spent the years from 1930 or 1931 to 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: How would you characterize the relationship between the Jewish and the non – Jewish children in Wittlich before Hitler came to power – in your school years?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: In my early school years, we had a very close relationship.</span> <span id="s26">There was actually no difference between the Jewish children and the others.</span> <span id="s27">Maybe I myself felt very very young as almost like an outsider even though everybody was very very nice to us but I was always very Jewish thinking – it was very deep rooted in me and certain things I went along with not with all my heart but I was accepted there.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: When you were in this Catholic school, did you notice a change in attitude after Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Tremendously.</span> <span id="s30">From one day to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: How would you describe this change?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I would say this is the greatest loss in my life – until today you know, I feel these few years were devastating to me.</span> <span id="s33">I feel today, I still think I’m a person without childhood.</span> <span id="s34">Even the teenage years, even later after I was out, I just couldn’t adjust.</span> <span id="s35">You know there is like a loss, a lack in the middle of my life.</span> <span id="s36">You know there is something which is missing and this was the years when I was – actually it started already before Hitler that I had fears and it probably came from the fact that my father was from Saarland which was at this time status quo between France and Germany and we were always listening to the radio – what will be for these people.</span> <span id="s37">Father for instance left Saarland one year too early.</span> <span id="s38">Otherwise, I think I don’t remember the date one had to be in Saarland to still be a Saarlander and father left I think in 1917.</span> <span id="s39">His brothers and sisters were still there so when Hitler came, they were called Saarlanders although they lived in Germany and they were able to leave the country.</span> <span id="s40">My father could not because he was considered a German.</span> <span id="s41">So, this sitting there and listening put tremendous fears – you know I was very young, I was only 9 years old but I was afraid what will be but from then on, it was always listening quietly to the radio and these things are so deep and are still nowadays still in my mind, in my memory.</span> <span id="s42">Sometimes I think it’s crazy – why can’t I forget this.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What happens in your childhood often remains with you...</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Were these girls in the Catholic school members of the BDM or any other Hitler organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s48">All of them.</span> <span id="s49">I was the only Jewish girl in the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did this affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Thinking back now, I think I probably would have needed later on some – a psychologist, somebody to help me to get over this but who had money and you know, we just went on and you went to work and you did this and that but it affected me so tremendously that I think now it probably could have been helped to overcome this.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: How did these girls act towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: First of all, nobody ever came to me anymore – I was not able to – you know I went to classes, I had to sit in Rassenkunde, I had to sit in every week speeches for the schools in Germany radio – Goebbels, Himmler, Hitler, whoever spoke and we had to sit there and as I said we had Rassenkunde and in Rassenkunde you – we had special teachers because the nuns refused to teach it and they were actually my good luck because they really protected us as much as it was possible but I had to attend these classes – not very long – then I was able to stay out but it had a tremendous impact on me to hear their things and after that you had Rassenkunde and it was talked about how inferior the Jewish race is and so on and there were some people I know – a cousin of mine who spoke up – she was older than I was – but I was just sitting there and saying nothing and coming home and being unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: When you came home, did you tell your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s56">You see, I wanted to protect them – they had their own tzures and I didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s57">Later on in life, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: That must have been very difficult for a young girl to listen to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s60">I think that was the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Had these girls been friendly to you before?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s63">There were very few who didn’t do anything, I mean nothing against me but they didn’t tell me either you are still my friend or so – they were afraid.</span> <span id="s64">I would say it was fear on their part not that they disliked me or Jews in general but they just were quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Children always like to be accepted.</span> <span id="s66">How...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Right.</span> <span id="s68">For instance, when we had one hour of games, I wasn’t allowed to play with them – they pushed me out – you know ball games and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you ever have the feeling that you didn’t want to come back to school the next morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Oh yes sure, naturally.</span> <span id="s71">But I did go.</span> <span id="s72">I went until one teacher once came to my parents and said why don’t you take her out.</span> <span id="s73">I see what is going on.</span> <span id="s74">So I was fourteen when I left that school to the regret of the teachers because they really were very good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Was it a nun who came to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: No.</span> <span id="s77">It was a lay teacher and she was very nice and understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: How did your parents react to what she told them?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I don’t remember that very well – I only know that I quit school very soon after that and went to some relatives in another town and went to what they called a berufschule – this was a very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">QL Was this berufschule organized for the purpose of training you for emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Right.</span> <span id="s82">I couldn’t take many courses there because I didn’t live in that city.</span> <span id="s83">I took English and some Hebrew and I did some sewing which I hated and then I had to go back again for some reason and then my parents saw to it that I went out of Germany and I was for a very short time with some of my relatives in Luxemburg who were Saarlander and could get out until we got our visas to Israel and certificate and then I had to go back to Germany which I was afraid again to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Let me just backtrack a moment.</span> <span id="s85">While you lived in Wittlich and were going to school, how did your father earn his living?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: We had our own business but this business went down immediately in 1933 – April 1, 1933, we had the boycott.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What type of business was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: We had a retail shoe store.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Were most of his customers gentile or?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: And they were influenced by the boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Very much so because this was a city where the district courts were and around us were villages where farmers lived and the farmers were threatened that if you buy there, you cannot get this and that but the district court workers and there was a tremendous jail there too and they all were employed by the government and they were threatened that they would lose their jobs – this was the main population there and so they just didn’t come anymore and we had to keep all the people who my father employed though the income was going down, down, down and we were not allowed to fire a non – Jewish employee.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Did you father ever have any problems with non – Jewish employees who were Party members or...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s95">They were pretty nice but coming back to this day of boycott, I still consider this my worst day in my life.</span> <span id="s96">I mean I went through quite a lot later on but this was a day which comes back sometimes in my dreams – after all these years – not often but it was such unbelievable fear and I have friends who went through similar experiences and it didn’t affect them so much.</span> <span id="s97">But I was a young child – I was in school that Saturday morning and I asked in school whether I could go home earlier and they said yes, sure.</span> <span id="s98">And the school was a little bit out of the district – the middle of the city where my parents had their store on the marketplace and there were different streets you could go down to our store.</span> <span id="s99">I came from school and was permitted to leave an hour earlier but they started earlier too – marching, which I didn’t know and I heard these drums and I think this was unbelievable fear and I ran with my school books down the street and ran into them.</span> <span id="s100">I thought they were on another street and I went by them but when I came to our house, they were standing already.</span> <span id="s101">We had a very large entrance to our store and on each side was one man standing with his big placard “Die Juden sind under Ungluck” or “Die Juden sind Blutsauger” and I had to go through under that sign and my parents were standing in the store and they had locked and they saw me coming and later on, my father and my mother said they never saw me as white as I was and I went in there and I started sobbing and my parents too (crying) and that was the worst day.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: You felt the pressure very early...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes, in this small town, everybody knew everybody.</span> <span id="s104">I probably knew every person maybe not by name but by site.</span> <span id="s105">I knew the people and my parents were very well liked.</span> <span id="s106">When we left Germany, many people came to the back entrance and said Oh we didn’t mean you – these are the people from Berlin and Frankfurt – these are the bad people but not you, we love you and come back and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: When you came home on this boycott day, were you afraid of physical harm?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: For my father because I saw before that that Jews were beaten in our town.</span> <span id="s109">I saw one man beaten and I knew of others.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: As a young girl, how did you feel when you were rejected in school and found signs Juden Unerwuenscht on the streets...</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: It was a time which I would say destroyed a young person if he wasn’t very strong.</span> <span id="s112">It seems to me that I wasn’t very strong.</span> <span id="s113">Now later on in life when you compare to other people, we didn’t go through that much but...</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: But at twelve years old...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I remember that they built this stadium and I went with a girlfriend, a Jewish girlfriend, we went there looking and the first thing we saw “Juden Unwe wuenscht” and “Juden und Hunde werden nicht herein gelassen”.</span> <span id="s116">So, this was also – but it didn’t affect me so much because I didn’t need it – for instance, there was a little cafe house which also had the sign but again I didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s117">It was much more what went on in school at that time which I had to go to and the fear for my parents – you heard about what happened to this or that person.</span> <span id="s118">There were friends of my parents who fled overnight and I don’t believe they did anything wrong – they were framed or whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: When did you leave for Luxemburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Beginning of 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Between the time of the boycott in 1933 and 1936, did your parents discuss emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Oh yes, sure.</span> <span id="s123">We tried to get out already in 1934.</span> <span id="s124">That was always – we tried very hard to get out – just anywheres and we were one of the first people who decided to leave and my father’s friends thought we were just out of our minds.</span> <span id="s125">There was one man who decided to go to Holland and he said to my father – why don’t you come over and we will try to find work for you and they didn’t come out anymore – they went to Holland.</span> <span id="s126">But when we said that time, we go to Israel, people just came and said you will be back very soon.</span> <span id="s127">You are just overreacting and I wouldn’t say that my father was Zionist and it was just – my father knew or had the feeling that it will take quite a while and we just couldn’t afford it – I mean couldn’t afford it financially to stay on.</span> <span id="s128">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s129">And besides my parents were just as unhappy as I was – maybe more about my younger brother.</span> <span id="s130">Our school actually came to an end and they saw we had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did your parents ever consider coming to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s133">That was actually our first choice and my mother had some relatives here who had left Germany after WW1 as young kids but everybody in the family wrote to them and they gave some affidavits but when we wrote, they told us they gave some already and they could not take the responsibility.</span> <span id="s134">And to Israel, we applied pretty early and this was still Palestine and there were three possibilities to get there from Germany as Jews.</span> <span id="s135">Either you had to have a trade which father did not, you had to be a farmer which father was not or you had to be a capitalist which my father was not either anymore.</span> <span id="s136">I mean before my parents were not rich but we were pretty well off and so the question was how to get that money to get out because we were unable to sell the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: After the boycott, did you father attempt to sell the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s139">Immediately.</span> <span id="s140">Nobody came.</span> <span id="s141">And it took a few years until we were able to sell and then for a very very low price but we had to get out and it was probably enough to get us out of Germany.</span> <span id="s142">I don’t remember exactly the financial standing but I only know that the thousand pounds were not available at the moment when we tried to get out – we hadn’t sold the store yet.</span> <span id="s143">So we were lucky enough that we had one relative here in the United States already – a brother of my father – who deposited 1000 pounds in a bank in Israel in our name.</span> <span id="s144">It was never our money because he helped many people to get out with the same money but with that money there, we got the certificate to enter into Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Just to go back for a moment, when you went to Luxemburg, in 1936, did you go to relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: You mentioned a brother, did you go alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s149">I went alone.</span> <span id="s150">He still was in first or second grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How did you react to leaving in 1936 when you were 15.</span> <span id="s152">Did you want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I wanted to be away from the small town where I was.</span> <span id="s154">I was not crazy about going to Luxemburg for personal reasons but I went anyway and made the best of it.</span> <span id="s155">I was not very happy there but it was better than – I missed my parents tremendously – for many years, I was the only child and then my brother came and I had been what you call verwoehnet and here, it was not the way I wanted it to be but it was better to be out and it was anyhow for a few months and then I was called back and we went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: On the day that you left home, you mentioned people who had come around to the back entrance, did any of your friends, either Jewish or non – Jewish come to say good – bye?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh the Jewish friends naturally.</span> <span id="s158">I belonged to a – this was the only good thing – I belonged to a Jewish Zionist movement and this was the only thing which we really enjoyed very much and you forgot when you were there, all your troubles and they naturally , in fact we got a party that time when we left and that was a good thing which happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: This was the Habonim which you belonged to?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Do you ever remember discussions within the group about the situation in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Oh yes, sure.</span> <span id="s163">We had also people from bigger cities coming to us to talk to us about it and I was actually supposed to go to Youth Aliyah but our visa came earlier than my going to Berlin for Youth Aliyah so I went with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: When you look back at your leaving Germany, do you remember how your father felt when he left?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: My father was a super German.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: As a child, did you see how the Nazi pressure changed your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: It took him a long time to change.</span> <span id="s168">It was for him almost unacceptable to be seen suddenly by other people as a non – German.</span> <span id="s169">In fact it went so far and as children we were always laughing about it when we were in Israel – father took his Eisernes Kreuz to Israel and my brother used to put it on and march around and sing German songs.</span> <span id="s170">I found it now – my mother passed away last year and I cleared the apartment and I found it with a few letters – disgusting absolutely but he had it.</span> <span id="s171">He changed completely later on when we were in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: But you say it was unacceptable to him...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Completely unacceptable.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did he think that Hitler would not last long?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: It was probably hoping more than believing because we felt it so badly – this anti – Semitism in our town and he knew what was taught in schools.</span> <span id="s176">These kids my age – what they were taught in school must have gone deep in them and they will carry it on certainly to the next generation even if nowadays they say that the youth of Germany is better – I’m sure there is still something of what their parents were taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: When you left Germany that day, how did you feel about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: My feelings were absolutely mixed.</span> <span id="s179">You know if I think today, I think something was not really right with me because I still had bad feelings about leaving.</span> <span id="s180">On one hand, I was happy to be out of the Nazi’s land but Germany was probably – I loved the land because though I was very very young, I loved German poetry – I still read it.</span> <span id="s181">This is the only thing I read in German but I loved it.</span> <span id="s182">I was a good student in German history but it affected me deeply – it was like a tremendous loss even though I was happy to be out.</span> <span id="s183">You see, these conflicts, tremendous conflicts, we were accepted and loved everything around us and then, this sudden, very sudden change must have, on many young people tremendous...</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: It’s like leaving home, it’s hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s186">I remember that I cried when we left and on the other hand I was so happy to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: I don’t know that a child watches their parents reactions at such a time, but how did your parents feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I know that they didn’t talk at all until we were out of Germany – it was just a terrible...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What do you mean by didn’t talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: They didn’t say a word on the train, nobody talked.</span> <span id="s191">It was probably inner turmoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Did they leave family behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s194">My mother had many sisters and brothers and very few came out.</span> <span id="s195">A few came out but the others were all in concentration camps and were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Do you remember going to say good – bye to these relatives before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s198">We went to say good – bye to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Do you remember discussions urging them to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We didn’t have to urge them.</span> <span id="s201">They all wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s202">This was also very frustrating that we got later on letters from other relatives – you could have helped us to get out.</span> <span id="s203">You know they still had in mind that my parents were once very well off and they thought they could have helped.</span> <span id="s204">But it wasn’t so.</span> <span id="s205">We didn’t have it anymore.</span> <span id="s206">But my father was probably much to proud to say – well, I’m at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Were you only able to leave with the 10 reichmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No.</span> <span id="s209">Since we left early, we were able to take our furniture and the household belongings and I don’t remember how much we were able to take out but more than that.</span> <span id="s210">We were able to live in Israel for a year or so on the money that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: How did you make the trip to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: The first thing was that one gentile man picked us up early in the morning – before other people were out – not that we had, we had a visa, we were free to go, we had all the papers.</span> <span id="s213">It was not like fleeing but my father didn’t want to have any commotion because it happened that one family who left before us, they all came to the house and they screamed and said thank goodness we are rid of you.</span> <span id="s214">To avoid that, there was one gentleman, who I’m sure he risked quite a bit.</span> <span id="s215">He took us by car to the next larger city and from there we took the train to France and from Marseilles, we went by boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: When you arrived in Israel, did you know anyone there?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What happened to you those first few days when you got off the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: My uncle helped us – he had an address where we went to – strange people and they had what they called pension.</span> <span id="s220">We had one room for the four of us and then we knew it was much more money than we could afford and we rented a room in a rooming house – all four of us again in one room.</span> <span id="s221">If people say now they have to have space – we needed space then too but it wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s222">I was the first time who worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How did you get a job – you were only 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: How did I get a job?</span> <span id="s225">There was a man in the same place living where we were.</span> <span id="s226">He was a lawyer in Germany and he worked as a waiter in a cafe house in Haifa and he came to my mother and said I have a job for you in the kitchen and I nearly jumped at his throat – my mother working in a kitchen.</span> <span id="s227">I’ll take it.</span> <span id="s228">And my mother said no, you are too young and so on.</span> <span id="s229">But I went.</span> <span id="s230">The next morning I was in that kitchen.</span> <span id="s231">It was very very hard work and I was a skinny little thing and was very upset with everything that was told – you know, people told me what to do and I didn’t have the slightest idea how to do it and they screamed at me and it was very unpleasant but I stayed until I got something better.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Did you know either English or Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: A very little bit – what I learned in school – that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: How did you make yourself understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: They all spoke German, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s236">I would say unfortunately.</span> <span id="s237">This was a German place and they took tremendous advantage of us.</span> <span id="s238">What was hard for me to understand when I came to Israel because I was in the Zionist movement, I was looking forward to coming to this land and be free and have the same rights and not be looked down upon as a Jew, this was fantastic.</span> <span id="s239">But suddenly to be looked down upon as a German – this was very hard to accept.</span> <span id="s240">Because of the job, we had to become a member of the Histadrut and everybody got a job better than the German Jews and this was also a conflict which I was absolutely unable to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Was this because most Israelis at the time were of Eastern European background?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s243">Right.</span> <span id="s244">They were earlier there.</span> <span id="s245">I mean there is no question about it that as they asked sometimes “Did you come from Germany out of Zionism or out of Germany?”</span> <span id="s246">and we came out of Germany – there is no question about it.</span> <span id="s247">Not that there were no German Zionists but we were not.</span> <span id="s248">But this they did not know.</span> <span id="s249">I was looking forward to living in Israel happily and forget about everything and then to be looked down upon as a German Jew and not being able to find a job which other people who were less time in the Histadrut got made me very unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: How was this anti – German Jewish feeling shown?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Oh, you were the Yekkes.</span> <span id="s252">They didn’t tell you openly, they didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s253">But it was hard as a German Jew to...besides, our knowledge of Hebrew or even our ability to speak Hebrew as well as the others was not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Also no Yiddish...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Right.</span> <span id="s256">Alright.</span> <span id="s257">Yiddish – our next door neighbors were Yiddish speaking and they were very very helpful.</span> <span id="s258">They came over immediately and helped us in many things.</span> <span id="s259">My parents spoke German with them and they spoke Yiddish but they understood each other and they became good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Were you at all given the option of going to school in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Probably I was given the option but I had such a sense of responsibility which probably when I think back was overdone on my part.</span> <span id="s262">My father developed in Germany heart trouble and was unable for quite a while to work in Israel.</span> <span id="s263">And mother – mother worked.</span> <span id="s264">She worked very very hard in other people’s household and I did.</span> <span id="s265">I did everything but I should have gone to school.</span> <span id="s266">Somehow if I would have been a fighter, I would have gone back to school sometime but what I did, I took courses here and there but they were more on the cultural level than what one learns in school.</span> <span id="s267">I missed out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Even now when people go to Israel, they are caught up in the idealism.</span> <span id="s269">No matter what the condition of Palestine was, it must not have come up to the idealistic view.</span> <span id="s270">How did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Not of my expectations.</span> <span id="s272">I expected much more.</span> <span id="s273">Probably if I would have gone into a kibbutz away from home, I would have adjusted better.</span> <span id="s274">I was immediately, although I was only 15 years old, in the mainstream of work and worrying about how the rent would be paid and I’m the one who is the strongest – my brother was only 7 years old when he came here and he went to school and studied and I had to help or I felt I had to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: You mentioned that your mother was working, what kind of employment was she able to get?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Only household – taking care of children which I did for a while also.</span> <span id="s277">These were actually the only jobs available if you didn’t speak the language fluently.</span> <span id="s278">Later on, I worked in different places – office work and at the same time, it was a factory and I worked in the office there.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Were you ever able to get help from any organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span> <span id="s281">I don’t think I ever asked for any help from an organization.</span> <span id="s282">We were always able to manage – to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: How did the outbreak of the war affect you in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I guess like everybody else.</span> <span id="s285">We were Israelis – couldn’t call it Israelis really.</span> <span id="s286">We were affected by everything.</span> <span id="s287">Whether my life was ideal or not, personally we lived through so many things there – the riots between the Arabs and the Jews, between the Jews and the British and our hearts were bleeding for all the things which happened there.</span> <span id="s288">We were in it.</span> <span id="s289">Whether we personally had our struggles, you lived there and you bled with every Jew who was suffering,</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: As the years went by, was there a big German Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s292">We lived in Haifa and there were a lot of German Jews who came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you associate mainly with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Mostly, yes.</span> <span id="s295">But I had other friends too.</span> <span id="s296">It was not – let’s say western Europeans – it was not absolutely German.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: You mentioned the trouble with the Arabs, did that ever personally affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s299">I lost very very good friends, young people.</span> <span id="s300">It was before WW1.</span> <span id="s301">They were caught, they built a new kibbutz and the Arabs built a barrier and they were all killed – I think they were 15 of them – and two of them were friends of mine.</span> <span id="s302">So many things happened.</span> <span id="s303">Then World War 11 came and they were very hard times but more or less everybody was in the same boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: what was morale like in Israel at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: High, very high morale.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Were there many people who you knew from Germany who were involved with rescue efforts?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: They were not my friends directly in Haifa but I knew some people who I knew from Germany who were involved in rescue efforts but they lived mainly in kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s308">They were the ones who really did things.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: To come back to your parents for a moment, was it difficult for them to make the adjustment to Israel considering that they were not so young?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: For my father, yes.</span> <span id="s311">My mother adjusted to everything in life, as most women do better than men.</span> <span id="s312">No question about it.</span> <span id="s313">I know so many people, especially like the German academically trained men – they had a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What did you see that made you think your father didn’t adjust as well as your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I don’t think it was only my father.</span> <span id="s316">It was all the men in this age range – my father was 50 when he came there.</span> <span id="s317">They were not used to all this.</span> <span id="s318">They were not used to drying the dishes in the house when they were doctors or businessmen in Germany.</span> <span id="s319">On the other hand, there were quite a lot of them who built villages and some of the most beautiful villages in Israel were built by Deutscher Akademiker – there were jokes about it – that they built it up, that they built the houses themselves and as they passed the bucket from one hand to the other, they would say ‘bitte schoen, danke schoen Herr Doktor”.</span> <span id="s320">But father and all his friends that I knew, it took them longer, it just took them longer to adjust.</span> <span id="s321">He adjusted to life in Israel but it took him longer.</span> <span id="s322">We went out immediately to work and the men sometimes waited for the opportunity to do the same thing they did once in Europe which was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: In Europe, a big part of one’s social standing depended on one’s occupation and this was all taken away.</span> <span id="s324">Was your father depressed over this?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s326">Yes.</span> <span id="s327">And I would say that the heart trouble he had in Israel was affected by that – “What should I do, what will people think if I do this or that” which Herr so and so did not do in Germany.</span> <span id="s328">But he did.</span> <span id="s329">Later on, he did quite a bit of hard work – it was just that it was harder for him to accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: When did you come to the decision that you were not going to stay in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: It was actually my father who I wouldn’t say pushed me but his heart was so determined to see his brothers and sisters again who all lived here in the United States.</span> <span id="s332">You see, they were as I told you, Saarlander and they were able to leave Luxemburg where they made a stopover and then they went through Portugal where they lived for a while and then they came to the United States and he wanted very much to see his family again and again I was the youngest – my brother was in the middle of his studies and maybe I also saw it as an adventure – to see something different and so I said I will go but I am coming back.</span> <span id="s333">I will see how I like it there and maybe I will make some money and will bring you over.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: When did you leave Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: This was 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What were conditions in Israel like when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: It was very hard – otherwise, I probably would have refused to go because I got more or less adjusted to life in Israel and I had friends but economically, it was very very hard.</span> <span id="s338">I would say this was probably the reason why I gave in and said okay, I am going but if I don’t like it, I come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Living in Israel at the end of the war must have given you an opportunity to see the ingathering of the survivors.</span> <span id="s340">Can you describe this a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: You saw all this misery.</span> <span id="s342">I had one experience which affected me personally very much because I saw it with my own eyes – this was the going down of the Patriot which I really saw.</span> <span id="s343">Haifa is built on a hill and I had that time a job pretty high on the mountain and the – I took care of two children at that time – and the mother of the children didn’t see very well and one could look down at the harbor of Haifa and we knew that the Patriot was there.</span> <span id="s344">Illegal ships were coming in and they were taking the people off these ships and loading them on the Patriot to take them back to Cyprus and the Irgun wanted to delay the departure of the ship and unfortunately, they blew out the whole wall of the ship instead of making just a small hole which was what they intended to do.</span> <span id="s345">And this woman said to me “look, Trude, do you think this ship is not standing straight?”</span> <span id="s346">I looked and said my God, and we took the binoculars and we saw – within twenty minutes, the ship was under water and I had friends who were on the ship.</span> <span id="s347">I had known beforehand that they would come and we later visited some of the survivors – some are now in the United States – and one who is a very good friend of mine lives in a kibbutz in Israel.</span> <span id="s348">Also, we went to the beaches in the morning and looked for people who arrived and we were called by the Hagannah and always brought in clothing for these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Did you belong to any organizations like the Hagannah?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: The Hagannah but for a very short time only – I think one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: When you came here in 1947, did you stay permanently at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I came as an immigrant because I was told it was better.</span> <span id="s353">You could always go back anyway but if you come as a visitor, it makes it hard to stay here in case you would like to.</span> <span id="s354">I came as an immigrant and after a few days, I said in one year I will be back in Israel.</span> <span id="s355">But it didn’t turn out that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: When you came here, did your relatives meet you at the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: How did you start to earn a living in New York in the first few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I took a job with a new – born baby.</span> <span id="s360">I was not a baby nurse but I had worked for several years let’s say as a kind of baby – nurse but I did very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: How did you get this job?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I got the job either through the Council of Jewish Women or Self – Help.</span> <span id="s363">I’m not sure anymore.</span> <span id="s364">They gave me two addresses and the first one I came to, they said you can come tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I lived for quite a while with my relatives and then I got myself a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When you left Israel you mentioned that you intended to go back.</span> <span id="s368">Did your parents want to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: My father wanted very much to come here not because he didn’t like it in Israel – he wanted to see his family again.</span> <span id="s370">They were very close knit family and I would have had to work a few years that I would be able to send them the money to come here and after three years, my father passed away in Israel so that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did your mother come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Mother – much later – she came here 1959.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: When you left Israel and came to the United States, did you find it very lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s375">In the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s376">I visited millions of people whose names I had in my book but with all the people around me, I was lonely, very lonely.</span> <span id="s377">It took about two years and then I wasn’t lonely any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Did you join any organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No.</span> <span id="s380">I had mainly personal friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Did you live in Washington Heights?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: How did you meet your friends – both men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Through other friends, and I went sometimes, not too often to the New World Club.</span> <span id="s385">They had what they called that time Wandergruppe.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: After having lived in Israel where you were used to a more mixed group of Jews from all origins, when you came here, did you still associate mostly with German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s388">I was more or less forced to and I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s389">I absolutely disliked it very much.</span> <span id="s390">I felt it was like a ghetto.</span> <span id="s391">On the other hand, I was in different places, smaller towns and I think it’s not good for an immigrant to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: What types of jobs did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Until I got married, I always worked here.</span> <span id="s394">I was a baby – nurse and later on, I stayed with some people where the children were no babies anymore.</span> <span id="s395">They were bigger children but I stayed because they were very nice to me and it was actually my home.</span> <span id="s396">It was my home.</span> <span id="s397">I’m still very close to them.</span> <span id="s398">I feel now that it was actually wrong to do this because I never went into business life.</span> <span id="s399">I never had the opportunity but I could have had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Was English a problem for you when you came here&gt;</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: In Israel, we only spoke Hebrew and German but I took two courses in English in Israel before I left and that was all my knowledge.</span> <span id="s402">I had some English in Germany but I stopped school so young that there was probably nothing left of that and my English was pretty poor when I came here but I could make out.</span> <span id="s403">I came to people with a new born baby and there was no necessity but the woman just spoke English to me though she was from Germany and that was very good and she told me that when I go to the Drive with the baby, I should stay with the American ladies – they will teach you and it helped tremendously.</span> <span id="s404">After a year, I spoke quite well.</span> <span id="s405">My accent is still here but I was able to make out very easily with English.</span> <span id="s406">I went to lectures.</span> <span id="s407">This woman was fantastic – she told me where to go.</span> <span id="s408">She told me to listen to the radio, not the German programs, only English, only the News.</span> <span id="s409">In this respect, I had an easy adjustment here.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: What do you think was the greatest adjustment that you had to make here?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Not to feel really at home.</span> <span id="s412">New York was such a big city and it took a while.</span> <span id="s413">Language was an easy adjustment but otherwise, to make friends, it was much easier in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Why do you think this was true?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Probably because we were much more open minded than the American or the German Jew is.</span> <span id="s416">I think the people here are much more selfish than over there.</span> <span id="s417">Even nowadays when people have all nice apartments and I hear still how can we have visitors – we always have room here, we always make room because whenever we went in Israel places, these people had just as little room as we had at home, but you made room for everybody.</span> <span id="s418">In Haifa, we had a three room apartment, small rooms but we had two terraces which have to be built in Haifa.</span> <span id="s419">If there was not enough room in the bedroom – both were bedrooms – they slept on the terrace and we had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s420">If we had little, you stretched it.</span> <span id="s421">And this I found here at the beginning very hard to accept here.</span> <span id="s422">Not to me, everybody was very nice but the selfishness of people.</span> <span id="s423">This I almost couldn’t accept and therefore I would have liked to go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s424">Also, this being together constantly with the Germans.</span> <span id="s425">I don’t know if at the time the German Jew was not accepted by others but they stuck together which I thought was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You had the experience of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s428">In the building where we lived, it was 12 or 13 apartments and there were people from all countries and we were friendly with all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Do you feel yourself today more a part of the American mainstream or part of the German Jewish community in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Now I’m probably more a part of the German Jewish community – at my age now because I didn’t get into the other but I would have liked to.</span> <span id="s431">But now I’m married to a man from also German Jewish background and hoping that my son will have it different.</span> <span id="s432">He will – there is no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: In what sense do you hope your son will have it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Because I think it is absolutely ridiculous to live in a land and stick together with your own people only.</span> <span id="s435">Sure, he has the background and often he says he is glad he has this background because culturally he has now the European and the American – he is the only one of his whole group of people who goes to classical concerts which comes from us.</span> <span id="s436">We took him very early in life to museums and gave him this of what was our German – Jewish background and he said this is an advantage, But his friends come from different countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: I wanted to ask you about some of the things which you did with your free time when you first came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: In the beginning, I went to lectures very often to widen my horizon because really I missed out in school so much and here you have the opportunity to learn and I was very often at the Y on 92nd Street when I wasn’t tied down yet.</span> <span id="s439">I wasn’t bored here – I was sometimes lonely but there are things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Did your parents partake in the cultural events in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s442">They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Were they able to do this also in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No.</span> <span id="s445">They didn’t participate in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Did they find that hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s448">Especially language wise.</span> <span id="s449">I mean if they went to the theater, they didn’t understand most of it.</span> <span id="s450">My Hebrew was not too good either, unfortunately but I could manage.</span> <span id="s451">My brother’s Hebrew is fantastic.</span> <span id="s452">It is still his best language.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Have you ever been back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: We were back – four years ago, my husband decided immediately not to enter Germany, absolutely no.</span> <span id="s455">But I wasn’t sure.</span> <span id="s456">I had a friend in Strasburg which was directly over the border – one hour from the town in which I was born – and they go every year once to Germany when she has Yahrzeit for her father and she wrote me that time – I had written to her that we come to Europe and that was the first time that I saw her since 1935 because they left earlier.</span> <span id="s457">We were children but we still correspond every few months.</span> <span id="s458">So I wrote that I will make sure I will see them – we were in Switzerland, Italy and my husband wanted very much to go to Austria, the idea just killed me, I don’t know why, and he wanted to go to Innsbruck where he always spent vacation when he was a child and whether you believe it or not, Innsbruck made me physically sick.</span> <span id="s459">It was the clothing – I don’t know if these Austrian or Bavarian dresses – dirndles and the knitted jacket which in Germany in my class – the children wore it for celebration – they called it Berchtesgartner Jaeckchen and when we entered Innsbruck the first thing I saw that and then the hotel was just as unpleasant as I had it in my memory as Germany was and in the evening he called me down, they were dancing down there and on the stage, there were these – to me they looked like the Nazis.</span> <span id="s460">Actually this is an Austrian tradition and has nothing to do with Nazism at all but to me it brought back the memories – the clothing of these people, the dancing and I nearly threw up.</span> <span id="s461">And I said let’s get out of here.</span> <span id="s462">We had anyhow only planned to stay one night and a day and he had to show me what he remembered.</span> <span id="s463">He was a child and they were his memories and he enjoyed seeing it again.</span> <span id="s464">But then he said to Germany – no.</span> <span id="s465">And then my girlfriend said that she had postponed her visit to Germany until I came and we will go over just for one day and I have two relatives buried there and I said okay, I’m coming along.</span> <span id="s466">My feelings were very mixed but I felt what could happen – one day.</span> <span id="s467">And then it happened that my girlfriend had a very serious operation just a few weeks before we came and she was unable to travel and I had already written to these people who had driven us out of Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s468">He worked for my father and she worked in our house.</span> <span id="s469">So I called them from Strasburg and she said she would really be hurt if I didn’t come and I felt that this was one person I would really like to say thank you to and so I went by myself and I was there two days and I would say two days too much.</span> <span id="s470">These people were very nice, they couldn’t have been nicer.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Did you go to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s473">I was standing in front of this house and a woman said to me ‘willst du herien gehen?”</span> <span id="s474">.</span> <span id="s475">But I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s476">I just was standing there and my heart was beating.</span> <span id="s477">And I went to our cemetery which was partly alright and partly thrown down and then I went to the synagogue which was still in a ruin.</span> <span id="s478">They are building it up now for a cultural center.</span> <span id="s479">I went all by myself – I said to this woman, let me go by myself.</span> <span id="s480">I want to go through the city the way I remember it.</span> <span id="s481">First of all, it was not as I remembered it anymore.</span> <span id="s482">It is not a big city but it is more city – like than when I was there.</span> <span id="s483">I went through the streets as I had remembered – I mean I found everything I wanted to see and there I remembered all these people who I knew and now they were all strange faces, and nobody knew me.</span> <span id="s484">I didn’t even want to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Did you have any contact with them at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: One girl came to see me, one woman.</span> <span id="s487">She was one of the girls in my school.</span> <span id="s488">She talked with me – there was nothing left anymore.</span> <span id="s489">It just left me very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Did you ever speak about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I went with this woman in one store and she introduced me by saying this is Trude Wolf, do you remember her?</span> <span id="s492">And he said oh yes, sure.</span> <span id="s493">His wife happened to be one of my classmates and he called her immediately and she came down and she was very pleasant and then I had a very interesting conversation with a man who seemed to be very bright and he asked about some Jewish people who came out alive and he did not want to speak about the things which happened there.</span> <span id="s494">He only said you know we were all in the Hitler Jugend as you know and it was so much fun, you must understand.</span> <span id="s495">This was in the way of a sort of apology.</span> <span id="s496">You must understand this has nothing to do with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s497">It was so nice to march and to sing and have campfires and it was very appealing to young people but we didn’t know what it led to – that it led us into a war where we lost thousands and thousands of our people.</span> <span id="s498">There was no mention of Jews.</span> <span id="s499">And I said and how about the people we lost – six million.</span> <span id="s500">He said yes, unfortunately, but he came back again about the war.</span> <span id="s501">Hitler brought us (Germany) into that war and I was so disgusted with that.</span> <span id="s502">He said why don’t you come over for an evening and I said no, thank you but I am leaving in the morning and that was all I could swallow.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: How do you feel about the Wiedergutmachung?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: My parents accepted it.</span> <span id="s505">I have no part of it because I didn’t get anything because I was too young.</span> <span id="s506">I would say it helped my mother.</span> <span id="s507">She on the other hand, also always called it blood money but she accepted it because especially, she did not get it while she was in Israel still.</span> <span id="s508">She got a very small amount until it came so far that she came to the United States.</span> <span id="s509">It helped her and I had the feeling that they owed us something.</span> <span id="s510">But I would have had mixed feelings too.</span> <span id="s511">My husband did not want to have any part of it and when we got married, I said don’t be stupid, take it.</span> <span id="s512">I say I was not 100% true to my own feelings because how can money make good if you lose your parents as he did.</span> <span id="s513">On the other hand, they took away everything we had and it was my mother’s only income here.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: How did your mother feel about coming here after having lived in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Mother came here after our son was born.</span> <span id="s516">I went over to Israel to see my mother and took the baby along and that made her come.</span> <span id="s517">Before she said absolutely no.</span> <span id="s518">She had nothing to do here.</span> <span id="s519">She had her friends there.</span> <span id="s520">And it was a big decision on both parts – on our part because we didn’t know how she could adjust here.</span> <span id="s521">She refused that time to live with us - she wanted to be on her own.</span> <span id="s522">She always was a very strong woman.</span> <span id="s523">We wanted to get a larger apartment and have her live with us but she wanted to be on her own.</span> <span id="s524">It was not easy for her.</span> <span id="s525">She missed her friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: How old was she when she came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: She was 69 and at that age it is not easy.</span> <span id="s528">She had all her friends, so many friends.</span> <span id="s529">And here it took a while but she adjusted as she had done inn Israel.</span> <span id="s530">She adjusted fantastically.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: What so you think helped her adjust so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: That we were all here.</span> <span id="s533">She was somewhat lonely in Israel.</span> <span id="s534">My brother didn’t live there anymore either.</span> <span id="s535">I was always worried what was going on there – whether she was well and I felt it was better if she was here and I could look after her.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: In looking back, what do you think affected you most of that Nazi period?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: It’s a hard question.</span> <span id="s538">The insecurity and fear especially the fear for my father – this was something I just couldn’t forget.</span> <span id="s539">Little events that come back to you – if you see a film – I remember I saw a film once “The Shop on Main Street” – there was one thing when the barber wrapped his things, put them away, hoping that someday he would be able to unpack it again – it reminded me so very much of my father.</span> <span id="s540">And I remember when we saw that film, it was not in New York and some people took us and on the way back, I started to cry and they looked at me and were shocked and I couldn’t say why I was crying.</span> <span id="s541">Certain things bring back memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Speaking about insecurities, how do you feel about Jews who are in exposed and prominent positions like Kissinger, Javits?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: We are people like everybody else and we have good Jews and bad Jews and I’m not afraid that somebody who is a Jew gets into a high position.</span> <span id="s544">If he is decent and I think Kissinger is decent – I may not agree with everything he does – but I do not think that his being a Jew would bring bad luck to us or to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
