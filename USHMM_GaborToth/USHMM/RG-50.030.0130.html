LEWENT</span></p> <p><span id="s11">October 20, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Could you tell me your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is Abraham Lewent.</span> <span id="s14">This is mine original name.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in Warsaw, Poland, July 1924.</span> <span id="s16">I came from a family from many, many sisters and brothers and cousins and uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s17">And we lived in Warsaw for many, many years.</span> <span id="s18">Even my great grandparents came from that town.</span> <span id="s19">I lived mostly in the Jewish section of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s20">Uh, to be specific, I lived...my parents and me, my sisters lived on Zamenhof Street.</span> <span id="s21">I went to school.</span> <span id="s22">I went to a cheder (ph), and a Yiddish school, and matter of fact, I went to a cheder with the famous Mila 18, and that was the place I went in a cheder.</span> <span id="s23">On the first floor, this was already, when I was about maybe 12...11, 12 years old.</span> <span id="s24">After I changed schools and I went to a school on Niska 4, and this was a school run by, I think, by some, uh, party, or...it was a religious school.</span> <span id="s25">That was not the thing.</span> <span id="s26">And that school I went until the war broke out.</span> <span id="s27">And I remember this was September 1st.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Let's not get to the war yet?</span> <span id="s29">Yes.</span> <span id="s30">Let's take a little time.</span> <span id="s31">I would like to find a little more.</span> <span id="s32">Tell me about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: My parents were very young people.</span> <span id="s34">I guess my father, when the war broke out, he was only 37 years old, and my mother must have been 34 years old when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s35">I had three sisters.</span> <span id="s36">I had three sisters...let's say, when the war broke out, one sister was 13, one was 11, one was 9.</span> <span id="s37">They all went to school, and we came from a middle class family.</span> <span id="s38">What I mean middle class, mine father was running the factory, mine grandfather owned.</span> <span id="s39">We owned a factory in Warsaw that was very well known.</span> <span id="s40">It was called Firma Baranek.</span> <span id="s41">This was located on Nalevki 35.</span> <span id="s42">The first floor was the factory, and downstairs was the store when we sold...we used to manufacture women's underwear, men's shirt, winter clothing for people, and we used to buy the raw merchandize in lots in Poland and they supply to us, and we used to have cutters and machines and we make the stuff.</span> <span id="s43">And my father ran all the factory.</span> <span id="s44">We used to have probably about 20 people, or 25 people working inside.</span> <span id="s45">And I guess I was a little boy that time.</span> <span id="s46">I didn't know what money means, but I guess we were pretty good off.</span> <span id="s47">I mean, I had shoes, I had clothes, and summertime, we used to go away in the country once in a while, so probably we weren't that bad off.</span> <span id="s48">And I guess my father...grandfather was better off.</span> <span id="s49">I remember he took trips to Israel.</span> <span id="s50">In 1935 and 36, he was in Israel, and he came back and he told us all the stories about Israel, and we all sitting by the table, listen, you now, what happened in a distant land and I guess in that time if you could afford to go for trips, you must be very well off.</span> <span id="s51">I had...this was one grandfather, and after I had a grandfather, my father's father, and they used to live near the famous Warsaw cemetery on Geinsha Street.</span> <span id="s52">(ph) Actually, it's not...the cemetery is on Ocopova Street, but my grandfather had a store, a hardware store, Geinsha 87 and his name was Moshe Lewent--Mothai Lewent.</span> <span id="s53">I am sorry.</span> <span id="s54">His son was Moshe.</span> <span id="s55">And I guess all those people over there, the did know him.</span> <span id="s56">As a matter of fact, I have to give you an incident.</span> <span id="s57">I was in a hotel in the mountains a couple of years ago, and I met people who ran away from Poland in 1956 when they chased them out...the Gomulka Regime, and I met a couple of people what actually they knew mine grandfather.</span> <span id="s58">And we happened to talk about Warsaw, and I asked the person...he asked me, "Where did you live?"</span> <span id="s59">And I said I lived there, but I had a grandfather living over there.</span> <span id="s60">And he says, "You mean to tell me Mothai was your grandfather?</span> <span id="s61">I used to go in.</span> <span id="s62">I used to buy kerosene with him.</span> <span id="s63">I used to buy soap by him.</span> <span id="s64">I used to buy shoelaces by him.</span> <span id="s65">And this was your grandfather!</span> <span id="s66">And Esther was your grandmother!"</span> <span id="s67">I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s68">(Sobbing, Sobbing, Sobbing)</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: It's alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: So after this, we started talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Let's pull back.</span> <span id="s72">Let's go back to your childhood.</span> <span id="s73">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: You are growing up.</span> <span id="s76">You want to take a break.</span> <span id="s77">Let's hold it a minute.</span> <span id="s78">Let's take a minute.</span> <span id="s79">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: And that picture is my grandfather.</span> <span id="s81">That picture which you have in your hand.</span> <span id="s82">This was him.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s84">Already.</span> <span id="s85">Alright, start the camera.</span> <span id="s86">Are we on?</span> <span id="s87">Okay.</span> <span id="s88">Alright, so we are talking about a childhood, and you had sisters and brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Tell us then, uh, what happened to this family when the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s92">When the Germans came in, my father...I mean actually we were...we had no food in the house.</span> <span id="s93">It was not like here.</span> <span id="s94">You had always something in the house.</span> <span id="s95">In Europe, everything you need, you used to go out every day in the store, and you used to buy.</span> <span id="s96">When the war broke out, the water was cut off.</span> <span id="s97">There was no gas in the house to cook anything.</span> <span id="s98">There was no food.</span> <span id="s99">So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some bread or the necessary things.</span> <span id="s100">And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour pickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of streets, there was a factory, they used to produce pickles.</span> <span id="s101">A Polish factory!</span> <span id="s102">And they call it Original, and they used to have the pickles in tents like...small tents, and large ones.</span> <span id="s103">As I found out, so I went with a friend of mine and somehow we got in to that building in the night, even when the bombs were falling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about 5 pounds and we dragged it home, and this we lived for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s104">Just on pickles!</span> <span id="s105">And once in a while, we got bread.</span> <span id="s106">But we had some rice.</span> <span id="s107">So we had rice and pickles.</span> <span id="s108">And this went on for...for weeks.</span> <span id="s109">There were houses burning.</span> <span id="s110">I mean it was...to describe a regular hell, because there was no water to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the fires go.</span> <span id="s111">It just happened the house we lived that nothing happened.</span> <span id="s112">Like next house, third house, in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the houses and look for something to eat.</span> <span id="s113">And this kept on for 4 weeks.</span> <span id="s114">When the Germans came in, so they didn't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s115">New rules.</span> <span id="s116">New Regime.</span> <span id="s117">They first thing they did, they made a curfew.</span> <span id="s118">You are not allowed to walk the street.</span> <span id="s119">But still there was no food.</span> <span id="s120">So the only thing they did was on the corner someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have field kitchens, and they used to give to the people bread and salamis.</span> <span id="s121">This is the truth.</span> <span id="s122">Right when they walked in.</span> <span id="s123">I found this it out through a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s124">When you go over there, let's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there is a field kitchen.</span> <span id="s125">You gonna go over there, you gonna get something.</span> <span id="s126">I remember like now I took my older sister.</span> <span id="s127">We walked and we walked and...and still the fires were on both sides, but the war was ended already.</span> <span id="s128">They occupied the city.</span> <span id="s129">We came over there.</span> <span id="s130">We saw a line of people, and we stood in the line for that bread and the salami and sometime they gave you two breads.</span> <span id="s131">When I got to the line, a Pole...a Polish kid came out and said to the German, "He's Jude."</span> <span id="s132">You know like...the German didn't even know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the Polish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like "Don't give it to him.</span> <span id="s133">He's a Jew."</span> <span id="s134">So now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean.</span> <span id="s135">So he chased us away.</span> <span id="s136">So when he chased us away, we stood again.</span> <span id="s137">So now, the Polish kids, they chased us away and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things.</span> <span id="s138">So we had to go home without bread and without anything.</span> <span id="s139">And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the Vistula, from the river; and this is like 4 miles.</span> <span id="s140">So we took 2 pails of water.</span> <span id="s141">Me and my sister took 2 pails of water, and we walked.</span> <span id="s142">We carried the pails so when we had to pass by a Polish neighborhood, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out and make us walk back.</span> <span id="s143">Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the city.</span> <span id="s144">Every citizen was on his own, and they know they lost their country.</span> <span id="s145">Still the hatred.</span> <span id="s146">The anti-Semitism those Polish people had toward the Jews.</span> <span id="s147">For no reason at all!</span> <span id="s148">Now they felt that they can do with the German help what they always want to do.</span> <span id="s149">And here they got somebody to point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with the water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry that far pails of water.</span> <span id="s150">So this went on for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s151">You know with that thing.</span> <span id="s152">Finally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I remember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a street in Warsaw, the Nalevki.</span> <span id="s153">And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot.</span> <span id="s154">I don't know how or why.</span> <span id="s155">This is the first time I heard about it.</span> <span id="s156">They took out 53 people from that building, men, women, children, and they killed them instantly.</span> <span id="s157">This is maybe 2 weeks after they walked in....in the town.</span> <span id="s158">And...and I don't now that...what happened with that soldier, how he got shot over there, and this was in the Jewish district, you know, and they took out 53 people and they killed them.</span> <span id="s159">And since then everybody knew that something terrible is going to happen to the Jewish people in that District.</span> <span id="s160">Now what happened to our place is that the German's find out about my grandfather's factory and the store, so every day you see trucks came in and they loaded up.</span> <span id="s161">They cleaned out little by little everything.</span> <span id="s162">My father and my grandfather, we grabbed some stuff and we kept it in the house.</span> <span id="s163">Not much because you couldn't grab too much.</span> <span id="s164">And little by little, they cleaned out the warehouse, they cleaned out the factory.</span> <span id="s165">They took away the machines.</span> <span id="s166">Everything they loaded up in truck, and I don't know where they had it.</span> <span id="s167">So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that factory, we lived awhile.</span> <span id="s168">We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2 years, you know.</span> <span id="s169">And after...this was around 1941...1942.</span> <span id="s170">1941 or 42 it start getting very bad, because the ghetto was closed in.</span> <span id="s171">They made a wall around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s172">I had to wear a arm band with the star of David.</span> <span id="s173">Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest sister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the street, she had a arm band, you know, with a..</span> <span id="s174">.</span> <span id="s175">with a star of David.</span> <span id="s176">And everybody in the house had always ready, uh, how you say a rucksack with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be protected.</span> <span id="s177">That was my father's idea.</span> <span id="s178">We don't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s179">First day here, they clean out this street.</span> <span id="s180">They clean out this street.</span> <span id="s181">You walk out in the street.</span> <span id="s182">You don't know if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the street and they need 100 people to go to work, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you.</span> <span id="s183">When we lived in that building, we lived near a courtyard.</span> <span id="s184">One time each house had like a committee, and they were directing all the rules.</span> <span id="s185">One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work.</span> <span id="s186">So who'll they take?</span> <span id="s187">Elderly people, they can't take.</span> <span id="s188">The youngsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people.</span> <span id="s189">And from that house by us, we had to give them 3 people.</span> <span id="s190">So each house, like 10 building, used to give 30 people.</span> <span id="s191">And 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away.</span> <span id="s192">When they came back, nobody recognized them.</span> <span id="s193">Each one was swelling.</span> <span id="s194">I remember that I had a friend.</span> <span id="s195">His name was Schemick.</span> <span id="s196">He came back.</span> <span id="s197">His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating, from the undernourishment those people had.</span> <span id="s198">What did they do?</span> <span id="s199">They dig some kind of dam in the water.</span> <span id="s200">They were standing all day long in the water in digging the ground, and from this they got swelling, and they were undernourished, and this kid lived about 2 weeks after they send him home he died because he was so sick.</span> <span id="s201">And this kept on like this, and my father was still home.</span> <span id="s202">My mother was still home.</span> <span id="s203">My sisters were home, and still we went some...and...in time of the night, we had schooling, like people made a school for 3, 4 children.</span> <span id="s204">They shouldn't forget what they learn, and we had libraries.</span> <span id="s205">We went in the libraries.</span> <span id="s206">We read books.</span> <span id="s207">We still think sometime sometime will get better.</span> <span id="s208">In the meanwhile, we had...there was a Polish newspaper.</span> <span id="s209">Actually it was a newspaper where the German printed but in Polish language, and this was smuggled in in the ghetto and we read it.</span> <span id="s210">We heard only about the Germans winning the war and they win this and this and this.</span> <span id="s211">We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s212">The radios was not allowed to have because they took all the radios from the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s213">They took away one night and made a decree, everybody has a radio, fall coats, good clothes, this has to be given away.</span> <span id="s214">And we didn't have no news actually what happened on the other side of the world.</span> <span id="s215">And this went on like this until 1942.</span> <span id="s216">42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well, we need people to go Ost [NB: to the east], means for work.</span> <span id="s217">And the hunger in the ghetto was so great, was so bad, those people were laying on the streets and dying, little children went around begging, and, uh, everyday you walked out in the morning, you see somebody is laying dead, covered with newspapers or with any kind of blanket they found, and you found those people used to carry the death people in little wagons, used to bring them down to the cemetery and bury them in mass graves.</span> <span id="s218">And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the ghetto to eat.</span> <span id="s219">There was no such thing.</span> <span id="s220">You couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations.</span> <span id="s221">It's your pot luck.</span> <span id="s222">If you don't have it, you die, and that's what it was.</span> <span id="s223">Finally when they start bringing people out from the ghetto, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the ghetto, we'll give you 3...3 pounds of bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s224">And if you just register, you want to go to work.</span> <span id="s225">Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and marmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s226">They just went and they signed up.</span> <span id="s227">Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that place, they got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to that place, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads.</span> <span id="s228">And they pushed them into the trains; and they pushed in so many people in the trains that they actually couldn't eat that bread.</span> <span id="s229">There was no room even to cut the bread.</span> <span id="s230">So what happened.</span> <span id="s231">Well, they send them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s232">The trains came back with the same bread because in the trains they used to put in 350 to 400 people in a cattle car and you had standing room only.</span> <span id="s233">You couldn't even sit.</span> <span id="s234">You couldn't even stand.</span> <span id="s235">You were just pressed like sardines.</span> <span id="s236">So the bread and the marmalade when the people had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in Treblinka, they had to undress and they had to leave everything.</span> <span id="s237">So the same breads and the same marmalade came back for the new transport.</span> <span id="s238">And this went on constantly.</span> <span id="s239">Now the 22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was home and there was, uh, a..</span> <span id="s240">.</span> <span id="s241">a raid.</span> <span id="s242">The SS came, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the court yard, and I said to my mother, "What we gonna do?"</span> <span id="s243">So she says, "You don't have to worry.</span> <span id="s244">I got a paper.</span> <span id="s245">Your daddy works."</span> <span id="s246">My father was working as a mechanic in a..</span> <span id="s247">.</span> <span id="s248">in the ghetto for the...for the...in the factory they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots.</span> <span id="s249">So he was like taking care of all the machineries and she has a paper that her husband works for the Germans so she says, "Don't worry, I mean."</span> <span id="s250">I says, "But I have to worry because I am over 17.</span> <span id="s251">And if they see me, they will grab me."</span> <span id="s252">So she says, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s253">You go hide."</span> <span id="s254">So I was hiding in the house and she went downstairs with my 3 sisters.</span> <span id="s255">Everybody was having that...that thing on the back of the thing with a piece of bread with a..</span> <span id="s256">.</span> <span id="s257">with a schmatles (ph) inside.</span> <span id="s258">I don't know what they keep inside.</span> <span id="s259">And that's how they went downstairs.</span> <span id="s260">And this is the...the last time I saw them.</span> <span id="s261">Because the Germans even if they saw the paper, they just took the paper like this and ripped it apart and they took them out.</span> <span id="s262">That time they took about 10,000 people to the place Umschlagplatz took the people to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s263">I was laying, hidden in a room on the top of the ceiling.</span> <span id="s264">They made like a blind room.</span> <span id="s265">If you wouldn't know it, you wouldn't know it's a room.</span> <span id="s266">But it's actually was like a hideaway on the top of the ceiling.</span> <span id="s267">And I was laying there, and I heard the Germans came into the house and they take them out downstairs, and I was laying there.</span> <span id="s268">I didn't know what to do, what to say.</span> <span id="s269">And I figured because of the paper, he's going to read the paper and he's going to say, "Oh, well, and he's going to let him stay."</span> <span id="s270">And he tell them to go downstairs.</span> <span id="s271">In the courtyard, there was already hundreds of people like this, and they took them away.</span> <span id="s272">This was around 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s273">And this was that day on July 1942.</span> <span id="s274">And another thing happened.</span> <span id="s275">If they have, uh, a norm.</span> <span id="s276">That means they need 10,000 people every day, and if they had 8,000, they just went around on the street and just grabbed everybody who comes along to make the 10,000 up.</span> <span id="s277">And that's what probably happened that day.</span> <span id="s278">They needed a couple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes from their Umshagplatz where all the trains went to Treblinka, so the first thing they did, ran into those court yards, and they grabbed the people.</span> <span id="s279">And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, my father came home and I told him what happened and I said to him, "Well, I..</span> <span id="s280">.</span> <span id="s281">I..</span> <span id="s282">.</span> <span id="s283">I can't be here anymore."</span> <span id="s284">You know, like I just can't find myself a place.</span> <span id="s285">First of all, I says you go away in the morning to work.</span> <span id="s286">I have to stay here by myself.</span> <span id="s287">And I don't know what can happen.</span> <span id="s288">Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers.</span> <span id="s289">I don't work.</span> <span id="s290">And if you don't have no papers, you don't work.</span> <span id="s291">It's just like, uh, you don't exist.</span> <span id="s292">So I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s293">So I spoke...I had a friend of mine...a kid I went to school with him, and he told me, "There is a guy who lives next house, and he works on the on the airport in Warsaw for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the airport.</span> <span id="s294">This is a good job, and you can stay there and at least you're going to be safe a little bit.</span> <span id="s295">I told this to my father and I said to him, you know, we're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay off a German.</span> <span id="s296">And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s297">That's...some day he came.</span> <span id="s298">My father gave him the money.</span> <span id="s299">I took with me...I remember like now...I took with me a leather briefcase.</span> <span id="s300">I took with me maybe 200 zlotys.</span> <span id="s301">That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin.</span> <span id="s302">My father says, "You take this."</span> <span id="s303">And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before.</span> <span id="s304">So I didn't have a chance even to wear it.</span> <span id="s305">He says, "Take it with you."</span> <span id="s306">So I went and I took this.</span> <span id="s307">And I remember like now the guy took us and we walked on the street in the ghetto...what nobody is allowed to walk, but he had a paper from the...from the...from the German Air Force, that he's bringing some people to work for the airplanes or something, so... And I saw these German SS.</span> <span id="s308">They're walking around and looking at us, see somebody and here they see four people walking in the middle of the street with any kind of fear with this look in them, so one soldier came over he asks for Ausweiss, so we showed him the paper and he says, "Go ahead."</span> <span id="s309">If you walked about about maybe 20 minutes and after I saw...I was there, I saw a German in an air force uniform waiting for us.</span> <span id="s310">He had half a hand because he must have been shot or something, so he's got...one arm was loose and he came over and he spoke to this guy and the says to him, three guys.</span> <span id="s311">He put us in a street car, you know, because a Jew was not allowed to ride the street car.</span> <span id="s312">And here we got those things you know because we are afraid to take it off.</span> <span id="s313">So he said to us, "We should take them off and he is going to stay with us, and he paid for us on the street car, those tickets, and we went all the way to Okence (ph).</span> <span id="s314">Okence (ph) is like Kennedy Airport from New York, you know, like.</span> <span id="s315">And I was over there...in Okence (ph), I was over there 16 weeks.</span> <span id="s316">RIght.</span> <span id="s317">I was in Okence (ph) from May...No...from July, August...No.</span> <span id="s318">I went to Okence (ph)...I went August, September, November...3 months....4 months...16 weeks.</span> <span id="s319">And we didn't know what happened to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s320">We know that there's no people left over there.</span> <span id="s321">Everybody is out.</span> <span id="s322">I didn't know what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s323">I didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s324">And I was there 16 weeks, and we worked by coal.</span> <span id="s325">We unload wagons of coal for the Germans used to use for heating up the systems and some wagons of coals went to Germany.</span> <span id="s326">So this was mine job, to unload and load coals.</span> <span id="s327">And once we clean airplanes...once in a while they took us to clean out the airplanes, the military airplanes, little things like this, not major stuff.</span> <span id="s328">And they used to feed us, maybe 2 slices of bread a day and a soup, a watery soup.</span> <span id="s329">But we had good quarters to sleep because in those quarters used to sleep the soldiers and this was an empty barrack so we had to sleep, we had good quarters.</span> <span id="s330">There's no... We had a little bed with a mattress.</span> <span id="s331">This is very unusual and, uh, the only thing was no was no food.</span> <span id="s332">So that money that I have, a couple of hundred zlotys, this lasts me for awhile to buy myself, and over there where we used to go to work, I used to take coal.</span> <span id="s333">I used to stuff myself in mine coat, and the coat used to weigh 20 pounds because I used to cut out the underline and used to stuff with coals.</span> <span id="s334">When I walked from the...from the air field back to the barracks, I used to ask the soldiers, the German air force...they weren't that bad...the air force.</span> <span id="s335">They weren't that bad because they probably were not indoctrinated like the German SS or the Gestapo, so I used to say to him, "You see how dirty I was.</span> <span id="s336">(in German) I have to buy soap to wash my face."</span> <span id="s337">He said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s338">So they used to walk slow.</span> <span id="s339">I used to run across the street.</span> <span id="s340">There was little stores from Polish people.</span> <span id="s341">They have little stores.</span> <span id="s342">They used to sell bread.</span> <span id="s343">They used to sell soap.</span> <span id="s344">They used to sell candies.</span> <span id="s345">And I used to go in and I used to say in Polish to them, "You want a coal."</span> <span id="s346">Oh, they were...they went crazy, because they weren't allowed to have coal.</span> <span id="s347">I mean the Germans took everything away.</span> <span id="s348">And I used to walk like this.</span> <span id="s349">I bend down, I scouped everything up, put in the pail and they gave me sometimes...they gave me a half a bread.</span> <span id="s350">Sometimes they gave me some a piece of salami.</span> <span id="s351">Sometime they gave me some candies.</span> <span id="s352">Sometimes a pack of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s353">I mean, that's all I need.</span> <span id="s354">I didn't need no money.</span> <span id="s355">I need to bargain with them.</span> <span id="s356">I need to deal with them.</span> <span id="s357">And this went on for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s358">Once I heard there's people starting to run away, from that camp, and I says, "Where do they running?"</span> <span id="s359">They found out that some people still live in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s360">And I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s361">I didn't know where to run...to who to run.</span> <span id="s362">And this every night, I used to sleep and I used to think how will I get out from here.</span> <span id="s363">Maybe my father's still alive.</span> <span id="s364">Maybe my mother came back.</span> <span id="s365">Who knows?</span> <span id="s366">And I was a young kid at that time.</span> <span id="s367">I was a baby.</span> <span id="s368">I was 16 years old, I mean I didn't know even how to think straight.</span> <span id="s369">But once it was winter...it was very cold.</span> <span id="s370">Was dark already when we walked back.</span> <span id="s371">I heard a Pole calling my name.</span> <span id="s372">He was standing on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s373">And we walked to the middle of the road like to the sidewalk, and he called my name.</span> <span id="s374">He says in Polish, "Is there a Lewent here?"</span> <span id="s375">And my name in Poland is Levent, not Lewent.</span> <span id="s376">And I heard that, I says "Yes," and I started to run to him and the German thought I am going to run away, he walloped me with a rifle right in my stomach and I fell right down.</span> <span id="s377">So the Pole, he saw that he said, he's going to be back tomorrow.</span> <span id="s378">Like this.</span> <span id="s379">I went home and I couldn't sleep anymore.</span> <span id="s380">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s381">I really hurt.</span> <span id="s382">This is the first time I saw them hitting somebody.</span> <span id="s383">He thought I am going to runaway you know because he saw me running out from the line of people and after that, tomorrow, the same time, he's there.</span> <span id="s384">He calls me.</span> <span id="s385">That time, I was smarter.</span> <span id="s386">I kept myself to the end, not in the middle, and to the end, and I said to him, "I am going to go buy something."</span> <span id="s387">And he went and he gave me a piece of paper...put me a end a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s388">And I grabbed a hold of piece of paper like this, and I went back in the line.</span> <span id="s389">I came in the barracks.</span> <span id="s390">I opened up the piece of paper.</span> <span id="s391">My father wrote me a letter, and he says that he is in ghetto.</span> <span id="s392">He still works in the same place.</span> <span id="s393">And I shouldn't try to escape.</span> <span id="s394">He's gonna get me somebody to take me out and bring me to him.</span> <span id="s395">And this was in December 1940...42.</span> <span id="s396">I couldn't wait.</span> <span id="s397">After 1 day...after the second day or the third day, nobody shows up.</span> <span id="s398">It's a week already, nobody shows up.</span> <span id="s399">So I says...I said to my friend, Landau, I says, "You know I am gonna...i am gonna run away."</span> <span id="s400">He says, "Don't do it.</span> <span id="s401">They're gonna shoot you.</span> <span id="s402">Don't do it, you know."</span> <span id="s403">I says, "No, I'll figure out something."</span> <span id="s404">So one night I remember like now, it was about Thursday.</span> <span id="s405">This was the 30th of December before New Years, between Christmas and New Years.</span> <span id="s406">And I did the same trick.</span> <span id="s407">I had coals with me, and I was dirty black, the face and the hands, you know, like anything...and I asked the same guy.</span> <span id="s408">He was an elderly man.</span> <span id="s409">And I said to him, "I'm gonna buy soap to wash myself."</span> <span id="s410">And he says, "Go ahead" "Come right back," he says.</span> <span id="s411">"Come right back."</span> <span id="s412">I went over there and I got all these coals, and at that time, she says to me...the woman, she says to me in Polish, "No," she says, "Little boy, what do you want today?</span> <span id="s413">Do you wanta bread or you wanta milk?"</span> <span id="s414">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s415">I need some money today."</span> <span id="s416">She said, "I can't give you no money, you know."</span> <span id="s417">I says, "I'll tell you what.</span> <span id="s418">For the whole thing, just give me two dollars--two zlotys.</span> <span id="s419">I am going to have fare on the street car.</span> <span id="s420">I didn't tell her this.</span> <span id="s421">So she took out and she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s422">But she gave me change.</span> <span id="s423">That's what I needed.</span> <span id="s424">And I went and...I never went back to the formation, and I walked...I was dark.</span> <span id="s425">I was dirty, so they didn't recognize me, and I took off this.</span> <span id="s426">This was the worse thing I did.</span> <span id="s427">You should never take this off.</span> <span id="s428">And I went and I jumped on a street car and I didn't go inside, you know, so to speak.</span> <span id="s429">The street car was on the end...the end...and I turned my face and I gave that lady 30 groszen (ph), and I says, "I am gonna...because I have to take another one.</span> <span id="s430">I remember now what street car to take.</span> <span id="s431">She didn't say.</span> <span id="s432">She gave me a ticket, and I was standing and standing and standing.</span> <span id="s433">Then I said to myself, "Oh, I wish it's over.</span> <span id="s434">It's over again."</span> <span id="s435">And I went with this street car about maybe 10 blocks, 20 blocks.</span> <span id="s436">Next to me there was a Pole standing, and I remember like now, he was a little hunchback and he had, uh, a sack.</span> <span id="s437">Maybe it was garbage inside or something, and I saw he looks at me, he looks at me, he looks at me, and I tried to turn my face away, and he keeps looking.</span> <span id="s438">Finally, he got right next to me, and he says to me in Polish, "What are you doing here."</span> <span id="s439">I didn't answer.</span> <span id="s440">I make believe I didn't hear him.</span> <span id="s441">And he says again, "What are you doing here."</span> <span id="s442">Finally, he got violent.</span> <span id="s443">He did it like this to me, you know.</span> <span id="s444">"What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s445">So, I says to him, "What do you mean what am I doing here?"</span> <span id="s446">you know In Polish I says, "I am going home."</span> <span id="s447">He says, "Don't give me that bologna, Jidek (ph)," you know.</span> <span id="s448">This is in Polish.</span> <span id="s449">"Don't give me that bologna like what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s450">You know, you see that, uh, gendarme outside.</span> <span id="s451">I am gonna turn you in."</span> <span id="s452">And when you turn in somebody who doesn't have this, on the spot they shoot you."</span> <span id="s453">So I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s454">After he says to me like this, "You got money."</span> <span id="s455">You know this is those people they used to call them in Polish in the ghetto, Schmaltzovnik (ph).</span> <span id="s456">Schmaltzovnik (ph) means he wants the gravy.</span> <span id="s457">He wanted always money.</span> <span id="s458">I says, "I don't have no money."</span> <span id="s459">He says, "I know you have money."</span> <span id="s460">I had 20...20 zlotys with me and I had it in my sock, not in the pockets.</span> <span id="s461">He says, "You have money."</span> <span id="s462">"I tell you what," I says, "we gonna go down and I'll give you the money."</span> <span id="s463">So I picked the street...I remember that now, the Jelasna (ph) Street.</span> <span id="s464">All the houses were bombed out.</span> <span id="s465">And when that street car stopped, I said, "I am gonna get down now, and he followed me.</span> <span id="s466">So he walked in with me in a bombed out house, and he said, "Now, give me your money.</span> <span id="s467">If not, I am gonna turn you in."</span> <span id="s468">So, I bend down and I wanta take out the money from my sock.</span> <span id="s469">And he was so greedy and he looked on if I don't leave anything over there, you know.</span> <span id="s470">And he bend down...he wants to see.</span> <span id="s471">So I grabbed a stone and I just hit him in the face.</span> <span id="s472">And he fell down.</span> <span id="s473">He fell down.</span> <span id="s474">I didn't hurt him or anything.</span> <span id="s475">He just fell down.</span> <span id="s476">So when he fell down, I run out.</span> <span id="s477">And I ran out...I ran...I don't know what happened to him, but I ran so fast because I lost...I lost the 20 zlotys I had, and I ran out.</span> <span id="s478">And I know if I will catch, the next thing that will take me to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s479">And I had the change where the lady, the Polish woman gave me for the coal and I ran to the thing and I got the street car and I went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s480">And I know up to 7:00 they let in all the people.</span> <span id="s481">Here was already 7:30.</span> <span id="s482">And I says, "Where will I be."</span> <span id="s483">I went over there.</span> <span id="s484">I saw about 20 people still standing over there.</span> <span id="s485">In one group 30 people.</span> <span id="s486">In one group 50 people.</span> <span id="s487">There's still a lot of people.</span> <span id="s488">And I mixed myself in and I had no papers.</span> <span id="s489">I haven't got anything.</span> <span id="s490">I couldn't say I worked any place.</span> <span id="s491">I just ran away from a work place.</span> <span id="s492">And here the SS stand by the ghetto, by the wall, and they let in the people where they worked outside on German arbeits, German work places.</span> <span id="s493">I went over there and I went to one man and I says, "Where's these people from?"</span> <span id="s494">So he tell me.</span> <span id="s495">He says, "We work in a..</span> <span id="s496">.</span> <span id="s497">in someplace where they cut food all day long."</span> <span id="s498">I was looking for a place where they do with coal because cutting wood you don't get dirty in the face and the hands.</span> <span id="s499">Finally, I found people that were working some kind of masonry.</span> <span id="s500">They were all dirty, no... I says, "I am gonna hitch myself out to hem."</span> <span id="s501">I go over there to them and everybody passes by and everybody has to raise their hands because they are frisked.</span> <span id="s502">One carries a bread, one carries potatoes, one carries red beets...red beets, and one carries...any little thing.</span> <span id="s503">I don't have anything.</span> <span id="s504">That's suscipicious already.</span> <span id="s505">I don't have anything.</span> <span id="s506">And here the people were.</span> <span id="s507">They go through and everybody stays like this with their hands up.</span> <span id="s508">When I get to them, the German...the...the man that stays by the gate...the SS calls me and says, "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s509">I says, "I work for those people."</span> <span id="s510">He says in German, "How...how come you don't have anything with you.</span> <span id="s511">You see all those people...one has got a bread, one has got potatoes, one has got this...and you don't have anything.</span> <span id="s512">I says to him I am very poor and I says I don't have time to buy anything to day because I worked very hard.</span> <span id="s513">I had to unload a whole train with coal.</span> <span id="s514">He says, "Is that so."</span> <span id="s515">He went over to the next guy.</span> <span id="s516">He had two breads.</span> <span id="s517">He took away one from him and he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s518">And this is the same guy who wouldn't even let me in next to him.</span> <span id="s519">And I passed him and I went in to the other side.</span> <span id="s520">I went to the other side and I had a bread.</span> <span id="s521">So this guy ran over to me and says, "Give me back my bread.</span> <span id="s522">That's mine."</span> <span id="s523">So I was afraid to start making a commotion because there were Jewish police, there were German Police, there were Polish police.</span> <span id="s524">So I gave them the bread and I said, "Thank God, I am on the other side.</span> <span id="s525">Forget about it."</span> <span id="s526">I came in to the other side and I have to look where my father is.</span> <span id="s527">Now I found out I have to go through three...three...how do you say it...three posts, with the soldiers to go through these.</span> <span id="s528">So I went to a friend what I know he was in ghetto, and I asked him what to do.</span> <span id="s529">He says, "I can't give you no papers.</span> <span id="s530">There's nobody here.</span> <span id="s531">Everything is bombed out.</span> <span id="s532">There's no people here.</span> <span id="s533">People...very few people.</span> <span id="s534">He says, "You have to figure out for yourself what to do."</span> <span id="s535">I found a way how to do it.</span> <span id="s536">I saw there's people going in groups.</span> <span id="s537">They're going in groups, like six people, they go through the gate or 8 people.</span> <span id="s538">I went to the gate and I said to the six people, "where are you working."</span> <span id="s539">Some speak German and some don't because I learn a little bit German to speak when I was working over there at the...at that military airport.</span> <span id="s540">So I make believe that I am the leader of those 8 people and I said in German, "You should all stand in one line.</span> <span id="s541">You give me all the papers."</span> <span id="s542">And I went over there to the soldier and I says to him in German, you know like big deal, I says to him, "Look, I got 8 people going to work and this is the papers."</span> <span id="s543">He looked on the papers.</span> <span id="s544">He didn't ask me for the papers.</span> <span id="s545">It was a miracle.</span> <span id="s546">He didn't ask me.</span> <span id="s547">He just saw...because they have respect for people they are...they are, let's say, leaders.</span> <span id="s548">So there he thought as I'm the leader for them, so...you don't ask a leader for papers.</span> <span id="s549">So those 8 people went and I went with them and that's how I went over there and after I went on the house where my father lives.</span> <span id="s550">And I remember like now, it's fourth floor and I walked up, opened the door.</span> <span id="s551">It was in the morning.</span> <span id="s552">Here he saw me.</span> <span id="s553">He said, "What are you doing here, Ike?"</span> <span id="s554">I says, "Look, I couldn't wait until you send somebody to take me."</span> <span id="s555">So...and this is the time when I stood there and my father took me in in that factory.</span> <span id="s556">He went to the boss, the German boss what owns...he was like...and he took me in and I was working over there until... I went through three, four selections over there when they took away the people.</span> <span id="s557">I..</span> <span id="s558">.</span> <span id="s559">one selection was January 1943.</span> <span id="s560">One day... You remember that.</span> <span id="s561">One day they called us all downstairs, came in a big deal from the SS men, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s562">They lined us all up.</span> <span id="s563">I remember like now I had a pair of boots and I had coveralls or overalls.</span> <span id="s564">I don't know what it is.</span> <span id="s565">And I was sitting there and he went 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out.</span> <span id="s566">He didn't make 10.</span> <span id="s567">Every sixth men he took out.</span> <span id="s568">I was 4.</span> <span id="s569">My father was 5.</span> <span id="s570">I was standing right next to him.</span> <span id="s571">The 6th one was out.</span> <span id="s572">After he went 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6 out, out.</span> <span id="s573">And a truck was standing right there so they took out about maybe 60 people or 80 people, put them on the truck.</span> <span id="s574">Didn't see them anymore.</span> <span id="s575">This was the first selection was that time.</span> <span id="s576">And I was working in that place until the ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s577">It was the ghetto uprising, that's the time it started the whole problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Talk...tell me what Warsaw looked like then and what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: In the ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s580">Well, in the ghetto uprising, I was not actually where the shooting was.</span> <span id="s581">I was in the small ghetto where the people were working, but we can see the flames.</span> <span id="s582">Where we were standing outside, we saw the flames.</span> <span id="s583">We saw the flames .</span> <span id="s584">You didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s585">Those people can do this.</span> <span id="s586">Burning up houses, whole streets, everything was one flame.</span> <span id="s587">We had a wall in the ghetto wall.</span> <span id="s588">When I was standing in the house, you look down on the wall and you see Polish people.</span> <span id="s589">They making Christmas.</span> <span id="s590">They making all kind of holidays, and they know there's the other people going through that thing.</span> <span id="s591">They didn't even mind that the had to help anything like this.</span> <span id="s592">So...for instance, when they liquidated that ghetto and they took us to the...to send away in the camps, they took me and my father and we were carrying suitcases.</span> <span id="s593">So we walked over the streets.</span> <span id="s594">Now this is true; this is not made up.</span> <span id="s595">One side of the sidewalk the Polish people from the town of Warsaw were standing and saying to us in Polish, "People, you don't need this.</span> <span id="s596">You leave it for us.</span> <span id="s597">You going anyway on...to make soap out of you."</span> <span id="s598">Now this is people that lived with you for hundreds and hundreds of years.</span> <span id="s599">You pay taxes.</span> <span id="s600">You live in their town.</span> <span id="s601">You were just a citizen of this town, just like anybody else.</span> <span id="s602">Where they had the chance to show how the anti-Semitism was built in...in the people of Poland.</span> <span id="s603">It was so built in, the anti-Semitism for those people that they...even if they lost the country, they still they have won their anti-Semitism against the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s604">Even if they lost the country because German occupied it.</span> <span id="s605">Still they had to show it.</span> <span id="s606">And there's a reason why Germany made all that camps and all the concentration camps, made it on Polish soil because they know that they will have good help from the surrounding, from the people because he didn't do it in any other country, not in Poland those things.</span> <span id="s607">I was in a camp...I mean this is something else.</span> <span id="s608">I was in a camp...in Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s609">This is a camp near Radom.</span> <span id="s610">I could of...everyday, I could have run away from that camp.</span> <span id="s611">I could have just walked over the fence.</span> <span id="s612">Where am I gonna go?</span> <span id="s613">Who I am gonna go?</span> <span id="s614">I was working with Polish people, they didn't even look at you.</span> <span id="s615">I was working in a..</span> <span id="s616">.</span> <span id="s617">in Skarzysko, in a camp in a..</span> <span id="s618">.</span> <span id="s619">in a machinery.</span> <span id="s620">Next to me, there was a Pole.</span> <span id="s621">He saw that every day I looked skinnier.</span> <span id="s622">I didn't have a glass of water.</span> <span id="s623">I didn't have bread.</span> <span id="s624">Nothing!</span> <span id="s625">They used to sit down just like home.</span> <span id="s626">Bring it in.</span> <span id="s627">It come the holiday.</span> <span id="s628">They had all thoses holiday breads.</span> <span id="s629">They used to say, "Here, you want a piece."</span> <span id="s630">You don't exist for them.</span> <span id="s631">You did not exist for them.</span> <span id="s632">And...and the point is it hurts you so much that you were living in a country for so many years...for hundreds and hundreds of years, and the people turned their back on you, actually turned their back on you.</span> <span id="s633">Like they were...like they liked, they were enjoy this what happened to you.</span> <span id="s634">Sure, naturally, they say a lot of Poles, they were saving Jews.</span> <span id="s635">But how many?</span> <span id="s636">How many?</span> <span id="s637">From 6 milion Jews, 3 and one half million was Jews from Poland.</span> <span id="s638">So how many you got in 50 or 60 or 100 Poles they saved.</span> <span id="s639">And for what they saved?</span> <span id="s640">With money!</span> <span id="s641">Because if the money ran out, they used to turn you in anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Let's come back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s643">You were in the little ghetto watching the flames?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s646">What happened to you and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Well, in the minute the ghetto burned and this what went start, they closed the factory.</span> <span id="s648">And they made a raid.</span> <span id="s649">A raid means they came in.</span> <span id="s650">They told us, "Everybody has to leave, and we gonna get shipped out for work."</span> <span id="s651">My father and me we sticked to let's be together.</span> <span id="s652">Let's start being together now the best way we can.</span> <span id="s653">One day in the morning the factory didn't open up.</span> <span id="s654">Everybody has to be outside in the street.</span> <span id="s655">You are not allowed to go up anymore in the apartments you lived.</span> <span id="s656">Everybody has to be outside.</span> <span id="s657">Around 10 o'clock, it came trucks and start loading up all the goods from the houses, from the apartments.</span> <span id="s658">Not us.</span> <span id="s659">They cleaned out everything and we still was sitting on the street.</span> <span id="s660">Around 12 or 1 o'clock in the afternoon, they tell us to get ready, we gonna walk.</span> <span id="s661">We gonna walk.</span> <span id="s662">It's about 6, 7 miles.</span> <span id="s663">So my father and me, my father's friend and his friend, we all stick together and we walked.</span> <span id="s664">That means we walked about I'll say 8 or 10 miles towards the place, the Umschlag place, the famous Umschlag place, to get on trains and take us someplace.</span> <span id="s665">We don't know where.</span> <span id="s666">We went to that...and that's the time when I told you where we carried the suitcases.</span> <span id="s667">Only what you are able to carry.</span> <span id="s668">That's the time the Polish people came and said, "Leave it here on the street because you have no use for this anymore."</span> <span id="s669">Like vultures, and if somebody couldn't carry anymore, they left it and you see them running and grab it.</span> <span id="s670">We went to that Umshlagplatz.</span> <span id="s671">We were sitting three days over there without water, without anything for 3 days, and it was hot.</span> <span id="s672">The third day they gave us water and they said, "We're gonna leave."</span> <span id="s673">And where we're going we don't know.</span> <span id="s674">They put us on trains.</span> <span id="s675">I was together with my father with this man and his wife or his sister was it.</span> <span id="s676">And they took us to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s677">Majdanek was a camp near Lublin, and over there was 5 fields.</span> <span id="s678">That means evry field had 8 or 9 hundred people and it was barracks and there's nothing to do Majdanek.</span> <span id="s679">They only thing you were Majdanek, you did you sit sometime all day long and sometime they took you out to work and half of them never came back.</span> <span id="s680">They make you sit all day and breaking up from big stones to make little stones or digging holes, digging ditches and covering the ditches up.</span> <span id="s681">That was the way.</span> <span id="s682">That's what you call, uh, a camp that actually is a annihilation.</span> <span id="s683">They annihilate peole, actually.</span> <span id="s684">Very little food.</span> <span id="s685">Very little food.</span> <span id="s686">And my father was with me together, sleeping next to each other.</span> <span id="s687">One day, this was...we got to Majdanek was in July, I think in August 1943.</span> <span id="s688">We were standing in a ditch and digging and my father was standing next to me, a Pole passes by, grabs a stone and throws it onto my father.</span> <span id="s689">And he was a prisoner too, you know.</span> <span id="s690">The stone hit his leg.</span> <span id="s691">I don't know what happened if he broke a bone or something happened.</span> <span id="s692">He couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s693">And in the night when we went home to the barracks, he couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s694">He had to hold me here, like this, and...some how we dragged him...me and that friend, we dragged him in the barrack.</span> <span id="s695">He was laying down.</span> <span id="s696">And his foot swelled up like this.</span> <span id="s697">All of a sudden it swelled up.</span> <span id="s698">So one guy said we should go and call a medic or a doctor or somebody.</span> <span id="s699">Over there, they used to call sanitar (ph) .</span> <span id="s700">Well, I didn't realize what's gonna happened if somebody gets sick.</span> <span id="s701">I didn't realize it!</span> <span id="s702">I thought, well, when a man got sick, something like this, that medic came.</span> <span id="s703">He wore a red cross.</span> <span id="s704">He came.</span> <span id="s705">He took my father.</span> <span id="s706">He says to him, "You know what you have to go on Revier."</span> <span id="s707">"Revier" means the hospital.</span> <span id="s708">And he took him away; and he says tomorrow he's gonna bring him back.</span> <span id="s709">I never saw my father anymore.</span> <span id="s710">And this is for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s711">Pick up a stone and throw on somebody.</span> <span id="s712">And he was...he was just standing there.</span> <span id="s713">The stone could have hit me, but it hit him.</span> <span id="s714">And it went 2, 3 days.</span> <span id="s715">Finally, I found out where the hospital is.</span> <span id="s716">I didn't even know where the hospital is.</span> <span id="s717">So, I walked over to the hospital and I looked around in the windows.</span> <span id="s718">My father is not there.</span> <span id="s719">So after I found out they took him away and where I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s720">Two weeks later, I found out that's people have to go away from here.</span> <span id="s721">That means there're looking for 3 thousand, 2 thousand people to take them to a German ammunition plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Hold it for a minute and we can change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Your father has been taken away.</span> <span id="s726">Tell us again what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s728">A few weeks later, about 2 weeks I found out that there's going to transport.</span> <span id="s729">That means that transport will be some kind of factory.</span> <span id="s730">And the reason the factory, because people say this camp, the Majdanek camp, was the worse one because I remember when we came in...in that camp, the commander for that camp made a speech to us.</span> <span id="s731">He says in this camp nobody walks out yet.</span> <span id="s732">The only way you good people is going to walk out is to through that chimney.</span> <span id="s733">And here I heard that they need 2 thousand young men to work in an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s734">I says, "How can I sign up for this?"</span> <span id="s735">So they told me to go in a place over there, and they had a list.</span> <span id="s736">I gave them my number and I signed up for this.</span> <span id="s737">And I was waiting.</span> <span id="s738">Let's see what happened.</span> <span id="s739">And here everyday I went to work.</span> <span id="s740">No food.</span> <span id="s741">And you getting weaker and weaker, and I figured if I can only get out from here, cause this is finished.</span> <span id="s742">In this camp nobody walks out.</span> <span id="s743">Finally, I found a place where you can register and I went and I registered for this.</span> <span id="s744">And there was 800 women I think...800...400 women and about 800 men.</span> <span id="s745">And they registered us, and we had still the striped uniforms and wooden shoes, and they load us up on trains, and before we went, the same guy, the commander came, and he says you're the first people walks out here normally.</span> <span id="s746">What is... And they took us to a camp, and this name was Skarzysko.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Try...Can you describe what kind of train you were on, and what the transport was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Well, the train was actually cattle cars.</span> <span id="s749">It was a train, open with no roof.</span> <span id="s750">Just barbed wire was on the roof.</span> <span id="s751">They put in the people in the cattle car, how many can go on.</span> <span id="s752">If you were the lucky one, the first one, you got a seat against the wall, you were very lucky.</span> <span id="s753">If not, you had to stay in the center.</span> <span id="s754">There was no...uh...toilet us to go out.</span> <span id="s755">Everybody used to do what he feels like it and instead a trip should take a day, they used to make it 3 days because who didn't make it, that's alright.</span> <span id="s756">So who was young...the elderly people didn't make it.</span> <span id="s757">Only the young ones, and that time I was about 18 years old, 17 years old.</span> <span id="s758">I was a healthy kid, and somehow I made it.</span> <span id="s759">And when I came into that camp, so the first thing they asked me, "What do you.</span> <span id="s760">.</span> <span id="s761">What do you know what to do?"</span> <span id="s762">So I told them this.</span> <span id="s763">Everybody says if you say you are good in mechanics and metal work, you will have a better job.</span> <span id="s764">That's what I said.</span> <span id="s765">Some people said as a tailor, some... So they asked me, "A young kid like this?"</span> <span id="s766">I said, "I learned at school."</span> <span id="s767">So they gave me...they put me in a..</span> <span id="s768">.</span> <span id="s769">in a building, and they used to make pots for...ammunition pots, and I was working over there maybe 2 months every day, sometime nights, sometime days.</span> <span id="s770">Food, very little.</span> <span id="s771">Very little food.</span> <span id="s772">You couldn't even exist on that food they give you.</span> <span id="s773">But somehow you...you just survive.</span> <span id="s774">I don't know how but you survive.</span> <span id="s775">You work a whole night.</span> <span id="s776">In the day they brought you back.</span> <span id="s777">One day they told me they're gonna put me in a different machine to work.</span> <span id="s778">What this machine does, it cuts little pieces of metal, and from this they make bullets, like for machine gun bullets.</span> <span id="s779">I was working with that machine, and I had to go always to the wall, and grab a long piece of metal and put it in the and cut it.</span> <span id="s780">One day I go over to the war, I see there is no metal.</span> <span id="s781">Here the foreman walks around in a uniform, he comes to me and he tells me, "Why you standing around?</span> <span id="s782">You don't do nothing?"</span> <span id="s783">I says, "I have no metal."</span> <span id="s784">He says, "What do you mean you have no metal.</span> <span id="s785">You tell me that the German Reich has no metal to work?"</span> <span id="s786">I says, "I am looking for metal and there is no metal."</span> <span id="s787">First, I got a beating right away for saying that.</span> <span id="s788">I have no metal.</span> <span id="s789">He saw there's no metal.</span> <span id="s790">He beat me to a pulp, the head and the feet.</span> <span id="s791">He kicked me.</span> <span id="s792">Finally, he went to another guy and another give me metal and I was working and I was talking to myself and I said to myself, "I have to get out from here cause if I am gonna stay in that factory, I am gonna die here by that machine.</span> <span id="s793">They don't give you to eat.</span> <span id="s794">They watching you all day long or all night long what you're doing.</span> <span id="s795">You can't walk away for a minute.</span> <span id="s796">I found out that there's other people...there're work outside on the plant.</span> <span id="s797">They're organizing something.</span> <span id="s798">Even if you pick up garbage, you pick up a potato from the ground, but still you can do it.</span> <span id="s799">You can't eat metal.</span> <span id="s800">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s801">After this, all of a sudden I felt sick.</span> <span id="s802">I got sick.</span> <span id="s803">I don't know what happened to me, but I feel sick, and this is the first time I got sick.</span> <span id="s804">I came from work.</span> <span id="s805">I lay down.</span> <span id="s806">One guy came over to me and says, "You have a high fever.</span> <span id="s807">You burning up."</span> <span id="s808">I didn't know what it is.</span> <span id="s809">He says to me, "Why don't you go in...in the hospital.</span> <span id="s810">It was not a hospital.</span> <span id="s811">It was like a pig sty.</span> <span id="s812">People were laying on straw.</span> <span id="s813">I walked inside.</span> <span id="s814">There was a doctor.</span> <span id="s815">He used to be a doctor before the war, but here he didn't practice doctor.</span> <span id="s816">And he looked at me and he says to me, "You got typhoid."</span> <span id="s817">(sigh) He laid me right down.</span> <span id="s818">He didn't let me go back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s819">But I know that every third day a truck came to that thing and cleaned them, all the people out and take them out.</span> <span id="s820">Because they have no medicine to heal typhoid.</span> <span id="s821">I was laying about 2 days and my fever must have dropped.</span> <span id="s822">And I didn't eat.</span> <span id="s823">I didn't... They didn't give me anything for 2 days.</span> <span id="s824">The third day I got up and I was dizzy and I said to the doctor, "I feel alright.</span> <span id="s825">I am going to go back to work."</span> <span id="s826">He says to me, "What do you mean you are going to go back to work.</span> <span id="s827">You can't even walk on your feet."</span> <span id="s828">And he started to laugh, you know, like who cares.</span> <span id="s829">And I said, "I feel good.</span> <span id="s830">I like to go back to work."</span> <span id="s831">He says to me, "You know what.</span> <span id="s832">You see that long table standing here."</span> <span id="s833">Table about 12 feet long, maybe more.</span> <span id="s834">"If you can walk around that table three times and you not going to fell down, I let you walk out."</span> <span id="s835">You know.</span> <span id="s836">And do you think I didn't do it?</span> <span id="s837">I walked around three times, and I walked that.</span> <span id="s838">And he told me, "You can go back in your barracks."</span> <span id="s839">I must of have this already about 2 weeks, you know.</span> <span id="s840">And finally, it was the breaking point was the last 2 days, 3 days.</span> <span id="s841">When I walked out, the trucks came over and cleaned out the whole hospital.</span> <span id="s842">This another thing.</span> <span id="s843">When I walked out, I just walked let's say 100 yards and I saw 2 trucks came over, and they took everybody, everybody out from the...from that hospital.</span> <span id="s844">I call it the hospital.</span> <span id="s845">It was not a hospital.</span> <span id="s846">Was a pig sty.</span> <span id="s847">Was just.</span> <span id="s848">.</span> <span id="s849">when I came back in the barracks, I had no hair.</span> <span id="s850">I hardly moved.</span> <span id="s851">Some people had mercy on me, and one give me a piece of bread, and one give me water.</span> <span id="s852">One give me hot water, and finally I got back a little bit, and I said to myself, "I don't go back anymore to work over there, and I will work in a place like...like building .</span> <span id="s853">I should be outside.</span> <span id="s854">If I'm outside, I will organize something to eat.</span> <span id="s855">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s856">I went in and somehow I got hanged up with, uh, with people that worked outside and I was working with a..</span> <span id="s857">.</span> <span id="s858">and everyday I found out how to organize food.</span> <span id="s859">I had a friend of mine...he used to teach me how to do those things, and...and...once I used to go to the kitchen, and I used to pick bones and I used to pick this and they used to throw it out and this brought me back a little bit to my health.</span> <span id="s860">I felt a little more stronger day by day.</span> <span id="s861">And this kept on...I was in that camp...I was 16 months.</span> <span id="s862">16 months!</span> <span id="s863">And when the Russians start to move and more they start to evacuate in all those camps.</span> <span id="s864">So what happened?</span> <span id="s865">I was from the last people in that camp.</span> <span id="s866">There was left maybe...maybe 200 from...from a lot of people, and they took us and they brought us to Buchenwald from that camp.</span> <span id="s867">Some people they took to Auschwitz, the first transport.</span> <span id="s868">Us, the last one, they took to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s869">We came to Buchenwald, it was a new world altogether.</span> <span id="s870">Because Buchenwald was a camp, a political camp.</span> <span id="s871">It was not a camp like to annihilate people.</span> <span id="s872">So the first thing, they brought us in.</span> <span id="s873">There was a lot of Jews from Germany, a lot of Jews where they were already there from before, and there were a lot of Jews they were... I found out that they were in the Polish Army in 1939.</span> <span id="s874">And they're trying to escape from the camps so they took away the uniforms, and they send them to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s875">So there was all kind of people mixed.</span> <span id="s876">The first thing they asked me and asked me if you were mistreated in that camp.</span> <span id="s877">I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s878">"Who mistreated you?"</span> <span id="s879">I told them.</span> <span id="s880">We had Jewish police.</span> <span id="s881">We had a commandant, and we had this guy, we had this guy.</span> <span id="s882">I told him all those guys.</span> <span id="s883">And not only me, other people too.</span> <span id="s884">And somehow they took care of those people.</span> <span id="s885">They did.</span> <span id="s886">It was an instance I had a guy, his name...German Jew, and he was a policemen in that camp, Skorjisko (ph), and I was working in that camp and I found out that when you go to 12 o'clock, he gives out food.</span> <span id="s887">What was his job?</span> <span id="s888">He was working with people they used to clean the camp.</span> <span id="s889">You clean the camp, and you used to give out food.</span> <span id="s890">I saw people walking around with little.</span> <span id="s891">.</span> <span id="s892">how do you call it...brooms and clean.</span> <span id="s893">I want to get a broom like this.</span> <span id="s894">I had to sell my bread to get a little broom from somebody.</span> <span id="s895">When I got that broom, I make believe I cleaned so I got an extra portion.</span> <span id="s896">This went on for couple of weeks cause I was working nights and during the day, I got extra food.</span> <span id="s897">One day, he says to me, "Where you work?"</span> <span id="s898">And I didn't know what to say.</span> <span id="s899">He says to me, "You mean you was cheating.</span> <span id="s900">You were taking from me soup every day?"</span> <span id="s901">Well, I said, I was hungry.</span> <span id="s902">He start hitting me.</span> <span id="s903">He beat me up so much in...in and after this he called over to the German and he gave me 25 on the back.</span> <span id="s904">Just for this!</span> <span id="s905">Now when I came to Buchenwald, I went to him and I told him, "I told you I am gonna get back on you."</span> <span id="s906">And I told those people that he was mistreating me.</span> <span id="s907">I don't know what they did to them.</span> <span id="s908">They say they took him out and they killed them or they send them away in a different place.</span> <span id="s909">They didn't wanta have.that.</span> <span id="s910">.</span> <span id="s911">I was in Buchenwald quite a while, and...and...for maybe a couple of months, I was in Buckenwald.</span> <span id="s912">The food was bad because nobody had to eat and they didn't take us out to work.</span> <span id="s913">They put us in a barrack like they were waiting something should happen.</span> <span id="s914">One day they called us out from the barrack and they wrote everybody's number out, and they took us in another camp.</span> <span id="s915">In that camp they used to make bazookas, German bazookas.</span> <span id="s916">And I was in that camp...oh...maybe 2 or 3 months with German bazookas.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Do you know the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s919">Schlieben.</span> <span id="s920">I was then one time...I..</span> <span id="s921">.</span> <span id="s922">by that thing, and working and somehow I remember like now, a airplane was flying over my head and I was thinking...I says, "Oh I wish I am that airplane.</span> <span id="s923">Maybe he'll take me away someplace.</span> <span id="s924">And I was just thinking.</span> <span id="s925">All of a sudden, the German, that guy who used to take care of all those things, and he was the manager, the foreman, and he took a bazooka (he must have been drunk or something) and he threw on me.</span> <span id="s926">And if this would explode, everybody would explode.</span> <span id="s927">But it hit me here, and it chipped off a piece of bone in mine hand.</span> <span id="s928">And I was bleeding profusely.</span> <span id="s929">And I was standing like this and the blood was gushing.</span> <span id="s930">Still a piece of bone is chipped off.</span> <span id="s931">So another guy came and grabbed me and took me in a place to put a bandage on because they were told, they shouldn't hit those boys from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s932">The Germans were told that all the people that came from Buchenwald shouldn't be hit.</span> <span id="s933">And here he did hit something like this.</span> <span id="s934">And I was walking around with that bandage.</span> <span id="s935">Next day, there was an air raid...English airplanes that dropped bombs on the whole plant and 300 people got killed because it blow up.</span> <span id="s936">Everything blow up.</span> <span id="s937">And I was that time...I wasn't working.</span> <span id="s938">I was in camp because of that arm.</span> <span id="s939">Next day, we heard that all the wounded people they going to take them back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s940">So I went and I make believe I am wounded to, because I had a bandage.</span> <span id="s941">I go over there to that car...was a car I remember and was a big truck and was about 20 people sitting with blood gushing down from their hands and their feet.</span> <span id="s942">No bandages.</span> <span id="s943">They were sitting down, half dead.</span> <span id="s944">And I had a bandage on here, and I went over there and I says I am gonna go back in the truck, and they asked my number, and there was a doctor over there.</span> <span id="s945">He says, "You can't go up here."</span> <span id="s946">I says, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s947">He says, "Because you're not wounded in the air raid.</span> <span id="s948">You were wounded in the..." I said, "Why do you bother...why do you worry about it.</span> <span id="s949">Let me up on the truck just to get out from here."</span> <span id="s950">He says, "I can't do that."</span> <span id="s951">And he let me down.</span> <span id="s952">And when he let me down, it comes the German officer and he writes down the names and everybody's gonna go in the hospital and he saw me standing here and he says, "Why...why don't you go in the truck.</span> <span id="s953">You wounded to."</span> <span id="s954">I go up in the truck.</span> <span id="s955">He wrote my name.</span> <span id="s956">That...everything is a miracle.</span> <span id="s957">And they took me back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s958">We came back in that camp.</span> <span id="s959">They gave us a reception.</span> <span id="s960">They made a movie, and they claim that see what the English pilots did to the poor...you know, all propaganda.</span> <span id="s961">And they gave us food.</span> <span id="s962">They gave us a meal.</span> <span id="s963">They goes...they gave us a bed to take.</span> <span id="s964">We hadn't a bed for years.</span> <span id="s965">Here they gave us a bed.</span> <span id="s966">They take us a shower.</span> <span id="s967">The first time when it was the bath, I was afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s968">Because I was thinking...because in the hole, I remember like now there was shower, but in the hole there was a big gigantic pool with some green liquid, and everybody had to go into that green liquid.</span> <span id="s969">What was it?</span> <span id="s970">This was disinfection.</span> <span id="s971">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s972">Nobody know.</span> <span id="s973">Everybody was afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s974">Cause they think, you go in, you gonna melt and nothing will be happen from you.</span> <span id="s975">So we were standing, and everybody used...they used to say schnell and everybody was afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s976">I personally was afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s977">Finally, he started taking people by force and push them in, and I saw they go in and they come out.</span> <span id="s978">So that's how we.</span> <span id="s979">.</span> <span id="s980">everybody went in because they thought nothing is gonna happen.</span> <span id="s981">So they gave us new clothes.</span> <span id="s982">They gave us bread.</span> <span id="s983">They gave us a soup, and they put us in a barrack to sleep there until the doctor will came and look, so the doctor came and put a splint (my hand was bad) and put a splint on.</span> <span id="s984">This is a miracle.</span> <span id="s985">Put a splint on, and they tell me I shouldn't go to work for a couple of days, I should stay home.</span> <span id="s986">I should stay in the barracks.</span> <span id="s987">So I was standing like this, and every 3rd day I had to go to the big commander from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s988">He should look on that arm.</span> <span id="s989">He only felt sorry for the people who the English pilots dropped the bombs, but every day they made selections and they put people to death, he didn't feel sorry for them.</span> <span id="s990">It shows to you how the mentality from the German was like this, cause they did things you couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s991">Here, half dead people came out; they gave care; they put bandages on them; they gave them food; they put them in a barrack to sleep, and the rest of the people, healthy people, they took out and they put them to death because they claim the English had no mercy and see what they did.</span> <span id="s992">As a matter of fact when I was in Buchenwald, I was in the same barrack with a redactor (ph), with the editor today from the Forewords.</span> <span id="s993">His name is Strigler.</span> <span id="s994">M., if you know, M. Strigler.</span> <span id="s995">He.</span> <span id="s996">.</span> <span id="s997">he was the guy who gave me every day my piece of margarine in the barrack.</span> <span id="s998">I used to sleep here.</span> <span id="s999">He slept about three beds from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: How did he get the margarine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: How?</span> <span id="s1002">He got...the Germans!</span> <span id="s1003">They gave each block, let's say they had 200 people.</span> <span id="s1004">So they gave 3, 4 pieces, and they had a little machine in there made from wire.</span> <span id="s1005">If you put the block of margarine in that machine, you push down, so each one came out perfect square.</span> <span id="s1006">A little piece!</span> <span id="s1007">This I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1008">And Mr. Strigler, he is the editor from the Daily Foreward, he was the guy who used to cut that wire.</span> <span id="s1009">This was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1010">From that...that...and I came back to Buchenwald, and this was already 44.</span> <span id="s1011">And from Buchenwald we went to another camp, uh, this is near Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1012">They call it Bisingen.</span> <span id="s1013">This was very bad.</span> <span id="s1014">Over there was mostly Russian prisoners of war...mostly Russia.</span> <span id="s1015">And they didn't have no barracks like 20, 30 people, 100 people.</span> <span id="s1016">It was one long barrack, maybe 1,000 people can sleep there.</span> <span id="s1017">And there was no beds.</span> <span id="s1018">You sleeped on the floor, one next to the other, one row here, one row here, and you see 500, 800 people sleeping the same thing.</span> <span id="s1019">And over there was very bad.</span> <span id="s1020">The temperature was always cold.</span> <span id="s1021">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1022">It was always raining.</span> <span id="s1023">It was always cold.</span> <span id="s1024">I mean I don't if it was the time of the year, but I had no clothes on.</span> <span id="s1025">I had just that little paper jacket, no underwear, wooden shoes, no socks, just a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s1026">No hat.</span> <span id="s1027">No hair.</span> <span id="s1028">You were standing in that cold.</span> <span id="s1029">It was miserable every day.</span> <span id="s1030">When you standing on appell for 2 hours in that cold weather.</span> <span id="s1031">And the...and the bread they used to give you on the end in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1032">So when they call your number, no name, you used to walk through thousand people to get your piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1033">And when you got hold of the piece of bread, to walking back to your place, they jump on you and they grab the bread out from you.</span> <span id="s1034">So the only thing to do, the minute they gave you the bread, you should push it in right fast in the mouth and that's the only way you could save your piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1035">And this went on for maybe 2 months...maybe 10 weeks in that camp.</span> <span id="s1036">This was already in the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1037">What do you mean the end of the war?</span> <span id="s1038">We didn't know even that was the end of the war, but you hear rumors.</span> <span id="s1039">.</span> <span id="s1040">people used to say things but this was already the beginning of 45.</span> <span id="s1041">And that place, they used to make oil from shale.</span> <span id="s1042">You know, those stones.</span> <span id="s1043">The operation I never saw.</span> <span id="s1044">The only thing I did is digging the shale from the mountains and loading up on lorries and pushing the lorries to a point and over there, there was no trains.</span> <span id="s1045">People used to stay with shovels...and dump it on trains or trucks and they used to take them away.</span> <span id="s1046">And I was over there until around 45, maybe February or March.</span> <span id="s1047">After they took us away from over there and they took us to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1048">That's another camp.</span> <span id="s1049">And no change in clothes.</span> <span id="s1050">The same clothes for the last 2, 3 years.</span> <span id="s1051">If you're lucky, you had...they survived.</span> <span id="s1052">If not, somebody died or you saw somebody laying there, you take off his jacket and you put it on, and that's how I kept kept going on.</span> <span id="s1053">And they took us to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1054">We came into Dachau.</span> <span id="s1055">I don't have too much recollection from Dachau because I think I had a very bad cold, and I had headaches.</span> <span id="s1056">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1057">It was just a cold or something.</span> <span id="s1058">But I couldn't concentrate very much because I remember I had a friend what I always stick with him and somehow I lost him.</span> <span id="s1059">He disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Talk about him a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: About my friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: About your friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Oh, he was a friend what I met.</span> <span id="s1064">He was from the home yet a friend.</span> <span id="s1065">He lived about two floors above me and his name was Landau.</span> <span id="s1066">His father died in the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s1067">He left with the mother.</span> <span id="s1068">And we stuck together, to each other most of the time.</span> <span id="s1069">Most of the time be together, and once there was a time that somehow he was taken away in another place, maybe 10 miles and by miracle he came back.</span> <span id="s1070">And we stuck... But this time in Dachau, I don't know what happened through a..</span> <span id="s1071">.</span> <span id="s1072">or he was taken away in another place.</span> <span id="s1073">We just split and I don't know what happened to him?</span> <span id="s1074">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1075">And from Dachau we...that was the time when that was so bad, we actually didn't know if you gonna get up next day.</span> <span id="s1076">Cause they didn't give us food.</span> <span id="s1077">They didn't give us water.</span> <span id="s1078">There was no cooking.</span> <span id="s1079">Absolutely nothing!</span> <span id="s1080">And about a week later, they tell us all to get out from the barracks and we gonna march.</span> <span id="s1081">We marched about 2 days.</span> <span id="s1082">I don't know where that is in the woods.</span> <span id="s1083">I don't know where it was, and they put us on trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Before you get on the train, tell me about the march first please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Well, the march was like this.</span> <span id="s1086">We walked about 8, 6 people abreast.</span> <span id="s1087">And let's say 50 people in a column and if there...there was...there was like a distance, maybe 3 or 4 feet, there were two SS going in the back and two SS in the front.</span> <span id="s1088">And the rifles were always aimed on the people, and we walked.</span> <span id="s1089">And who couldn't walk because of lacking of food or water or something happened to him...he got sick, he get shot immediately.</span> <span id="s1090">There was no mercy.</span> <span id="s1091">Get up or carry you.</span> <span id="s1092">And if they see somebody was carrying or dragging, you both get shot.</span> <span id="s1093">So somehow we walked.</span> <span id="s1094">You can hear only the clap clap from the wooden shoes, and we walked, let's say, maybe a day, maybe a day and a half.</span> <span id="s1095">And I..</span> <span id="s1096">.</span> <span id="s1097">if you tell me where I was, I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s1098">I..</span> <span id="s1099">I know we was...how far can we walk?</span> <span id="s1100">But you were just...your mind was on blank.</span> <span id="s1101">I mean, there was no thinking anymore.</span> <span id="s1102">And we walked and we came to a place, there was standing maybe 15 or 20 trains, cars, cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1103">And they told us to sit down and take a rest.</span> <span id="s1104">We sit down and we rested, and everybody was screaming water, you know this.</span> <span id="s1105">And the minute we said something, right away they take the rifles and shoot in the air.</span> <span id="s1106">And in that thing there was not only SS.</span> <span id="s1107">There was a lot of Ukrainian soldiers what they were guarding some camp or something and they wore those uniforms, and they were very mean, very mean.</span> <span id="s1108">They pushed us in the cars.</span> <span id="s1109">Somehow I went to a place.</span> <span id="s1110">I was laying against the wall, and it was so bad because after 3 days nothing to have in your mouth.</span> <span id="s1111">.</span> <span id="s1112">Nothing!</span> <span id="s1113">And I figured that theiy are going to starve us out or something, so they're trying to run the trains.</span> <span id="s1114">We went into the trains.</span> <span id="s1115">You can see only the sky.</span> <span id="s1116">The trains were open.</span> <span id="s1117">There was just wire on the top.</span> <span id="s1118">And I was very delirious...delirious.</span> <span id="s1119">I mean I really don't know at that time what happened, I mean.</span> <span id="s1120">And I was laying in the train .</span> <span id="s1121">And I didn't feel even hungry any more.</span> <span id="s1122">You know you get to the point, the end of the line you don't feel anything.</span> <span id="s1123">And we went in that train maybe a day...a day and a half.</span> <span id="s1124">All of a sudden I hear the German soldiers they jumping off the train, they going on the train, they stopping the train like there's something going on, and they didn't know what.</span> <span id="s1125">So one soldier, he was already an elderly man because the youngsters were away already.</span> <span id="s1126">The youngsters were sitting on the roof and the old guys, they were sitting in the train with us to guard.</span> <span id="s1127">He says, "You know your President died."</span> <span id="s1128">That's the time when Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s1129">"Your President."</span> <span id="s1130">in German he said it.</span> <span id="s1131">I mean you couldn't even make it out what it means your president died.</span> <span id="s1132">I mean I didn't know if the president was a Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1133">I didn't know those things.</span> <span id="s1134">But the way he said it, "Your President died."</span> <span id="s1135">Now.</span> <span id="s1136">.</span> <span id="s1137">and this was like in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1138">I remember like it's getting dark, so we trying to ask the soldier, "Where are we going?"</span> <span id="s1139">He says he doesn't know...he doesn't know.</span> <span id="s1140">And he was sitting and eating, cutting the bread and eating, and here were people sitting and starving.</span> <span id="s1141">And the night the same thing.</span> <span id="s1142">The train stopped.</span> <span id="s1143">All the soldiers go down from the train.</span> <span id="s1144">After they come back to the train, there's something going on they didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1145">Next day in the morning, we saw all the soldiers with no insignia anymore.</span> <span id="s1146">No insignia.</span> <span id="s1147">Everybody you noticed that is the same.</span> <span id="s1148">There was no officers.</span> <span id="s1149">There was no sergeants.</span> <span id="s1150">There was no thing.</span> <span id="s1151">Everybody had no insignias.</span> <span id="s1152">The uniform had no insignias.</span> <span id="s1153">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1154">We didn't understand what it means.</span> <span id="s1155">Now...now we realize what it means.</span> <span id="s1156">And this was April the 30th, 1945.</span> <span id="s1157">And this was a town named Staltah (ph).</span> <span id="s1158">This is maybe 30 miles from Munich.</span> <span id="s1159">And you imagined the train was going around in circles.</span> <span id="s1160">They didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s1161">One probably says we shoot them, one says no, one says the Americans are coming probably.</span> <span id="s1162">They didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s1163">That's the reason...it's only 30, 40 miles distance and they traveled 2 days just around the clock.</span> <span id="s1164">I was sitting in the train and all of a sudden the train was standing on the top and the bottom was the highway, and we saw the tanks coming.</span> <span id="s1165">And this was American tanks.</span> <span id="s1166">And we saw the stars and all the soldiers...the German soldiers saw that, they start jumping from the train.</span> <span id="s1167">They dropped their rifles and they started running.</span> <span id="s1168">Well, everybody from the train...barely we opened the doors because the doors were closed.</span> <span id="s1169">We opened the doors.</span> <span id="s1170">They weren't locked.</span> <span id="s1171">We opened the doors.</span> <span id="s1172">Nobody could get out because it was so high to jump.</span> <span id="s1173">And here you got half dead people.</span> <span id="s1174">If this will take another day, nobody will be alive in those trains without food.</span> <span id="s1175">So they start falling out like this, who got hurt, and they started rolling down to the ravine, all the way down to the bottom where the tanks were coming.</span> <span id="s1176">So I said to a guy, "Push me."</span> <span id="s1177">So he pushed me out and the same thing.</span> <span id="s1178">Just keep rolling like this until the end and I stopped.</span> <span id="s1179">And here the tanks are coming.</span> <span id="s1180">I just remember like now, a guy came over from the tank.</span> <span id="s1181">He came over to me and he says to me...I don't know if he spoke German or half English...if I am alright.</span> <span id="s1182">I says yes, and I says wasser , wasser , means water.</span> <span id="s1183">He took that field tank and he gave me some water and he says, "I am a Jew."</span> <span id="s1184">I says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1185">He says, "I am a Jew too."</span> <span id="s1186">And he says...and he took off a mezuzah he had and he put it on me, and he says (sobbing) "You're gonna live," he says.</span> <span id="s1187">He took out a chocolate and he gave me and he says in Yiddish, " I have a job to do.</span> <span id="s1188">I am busy.</span> <span id="s1189">The war is still on, and I can't take care of you.</span> <span id="s1190">He says, "I leave you here and somebody will come after (sobbing) and take you."</span> <span id="s1191">I was laying there on the ground maybe 2 hours and all the tanks passed by and soldiers and trucks and jeeps and they didn't care about the people because they're going to the front.</span> <span id="s1192">And maybe 2, 3 hours later, probably the...those people they clean up, you know...they reserved for this...or the medical corps, and they saw what happened (sobbing) What a sight!</span> <span id="s1193">What a sight!</span> <span id="s1194">You see thousands, hundreds of people laying half dead.</span> <span id="s1195">A young man had that body they moved, and I remember I was laying there on this guy says and he said, "Oh my God, what a sight!"</span> <span id="s1196">(sobbing) They start picking up the people (sobbing).</span> <span id="s1197">The picked them up one by one.</span> <span id="s1198">Most of them were dead because they could... And the water...and those that were alive they put them in trucks and jeeps, and they took them to hospitals or they made tents and they put them in.</span> <span id="s1199">They gave them water.</span> <span id="s1200">They gave them packets from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1201">And this was bad too because people when they got those packages, there was powdered milk, there was chocolate; there was a can of meat, and they were so hungry, they didn't care and they ate it.</span> <span id="s1202">So hundreds died from eating this stuff, because their stomach was no used to food.</span> <span id="s1203">And I had a guy next to me...I don't know if he was a doctor once or something...he was half dead too.</span> <span id="s1204">When he got that package...and I think he was Hungarian or Rumanian...he says to me, "Don't eat nothing.</span> <span id="s1205">Don't eat nothing.</span> <span id="s1206">If you gonna eat anything, you gonna die.</span> <span id="s1207">The only thing you do, if you have sugar, take the sugar in the mouth and suck on the sugar.</span> <span id="s1208">That's that the only thing you should do, he says, the rest of them throw away.</span> <span id="s1209">And if you want to keep it, keep it, but don't eat anything.</span> <span id="s1210">Don't take the milk in your mouth.</span> <span id="s1211">Don't take the chocolate.</span> <span id="s1212">Don't take the meat because they used to give you a can of meat, Spam.</span> <span id="s1213">Don't eat it, because if you're gonna eat it, you're gonna die.</span> <span id="s1214">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1215">Those people, they eat the stuff, they got diahrrea and they died.</span> <span id="s1216">So what I do and I had that sugar, Domino sugar, the little tiny pieces, and I used to suck on that sugar.</span> <span id="s1217">I was so hungry I could eat an elephant.</span> <span id="s1218">But he said to me, "You're gonna die if you're gonna eat it," this guy.</span> <span id="s1219">Well, this guy died.</span> <span id="s1220">Yah, he died next day.</span> <span id="s1221">He died not from eating.</span> <span id="s1222">He died because he just...just his heart stopped.</span> <span id="s1223">He just died.</span> <span id="s1224">And this guy saved me because he said, "Don't eat anything.</span> <span id="s1225">Just suck on the sugar."</span> <span id="s1226">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s1227">And for 2 days I laid there.</span> <span id="s1228">They didn't give us no food.</span> <span id="s1229">They used to give us cereal.</span> <span id="s1230">A bowl of cereal everyday.</span> <span id="s1231">That's the only food.</span> <span id="s1232">And they used to say to the people, "Don't eat this stuff because..." People didn't listen because they were so hungry.</span> <span id="s1233">And after a while, they gave us start giving us a piece of bread and like a little baby, they nudge us back to normality, like a little child.</span> <span id="s1234">Here you see people after they gave us a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1235">The next day they give us a little piece of soup.</span> <span id="s1236">You know...cereal soup.</span> <span id="s1237">No soup with meat and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1238">And little by little, you know, you get back.</span> <span id="s1239">And I was in that tent maybe a week.</span> <span id="s1240">And after...and they didn't give us clothes.</span> <span id="s1241">No clothes.</span> <span id="s1242">I still was laying in the same thing.</span> <span id="s1243">The only thing I have is a Army blanket.</span> <span id="s1244">You know those green blankets.</span> <span id="s1245">After this, and this was, let's say about near Munich someplace, and after the sanitar corps went away there too.</span> <span id="s1246">There is nobody there.</span> <span id="s1247">Because the war is still on.</span> <span id="s1248">It was not the 8th of May yet.</span> <span id="s1249">That was the 2nd of May, the 3rd of May.</span> <span id="s1250">But they were nice to us.</span> <span id="s1251">You know they still say to us...a lot of Jews was there and they still say, "There's the front and we have to leave you and the only thing what was in those tents was two men and they were taking care of those tents.</span> <span id="s1252">And left us tents, and the German from this town had to come every day and clean those tents out and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s1253">And after the German had to come and dig a big hole and they buried all the dead people that was laying around the train.</span> <span id="s1254">It was a sight!</span> <span id="s1255">It was a sight because the train was on top, and the bottom was the highway, and the people used to go from the train like this, falling down and you see all hanging on the bushes, near a tree, in the grass, and you see men and women, and small men, and large men.</span> <span id="s1256">Everybody was laying spread over.</span> <span id="s1257">They were dead.</span> <span id="s1258">They were just couldn't...they just couldn't hold it on anymore.</span> <span id="s1259">The minute the train opened up, you see all falling out.</span> <span id="s1260">They were half...every car had half dead people inside.</span> <span id="s1261">Like I told you, only young people could have survived.</span> <span id="s1262">Only the youngsters.</span> <span id="s1263">And after this, me and one more guy went over there.</span> <span id="s1264">We took our little strength and we says, "We're gonna walk to a town.</span> <span id="s1265">And we walked in that uniforms.</span> <span id="s1266">We felt more strength, and I remember like now we came to a house with a German woman inside, and she saw us and she started running.</span> <span id="s1267">She run away.</span> <span id="s1268">She saw both of us and we wore striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s1269">We walked in that house.</span> <span id="s1270">What a beautiful house.</span> <span id="s1271">All kind of china, with closets with clothes.</span> <span id="s1272">First thing I did I took off my things.</span> <span id="s1273">I took out a shirt, and I put on a shirt.</span> <span id="s1274">This is the first time in 3, 4 years I had a shirt on my back.</span> <span id="s1275">Shoes I couldn't find, but I found a pair of rubber shoes.</span> <span id="s1276">I put on the rubber shoes.</span> <span id="s1277">And a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s1278">And after I saw her looking and I hollered to her, "Come here.</span> <span id="s1279">You know what I need some food, you know, to eat."</span> <span id="s1280">So she gave us some food.</span> <span id="s1281">But I saw her looking outside.</span> <span id="s1282">She looked...she looked outside.</span> <span id="s1283">I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1284">And there was a dog house.</span> <span id="s1285">And what do you think?</span> <span id="s1286">In the dog house, there was a little girl, maybe 4 years old.</span> <span id="s1287">She was...she hid.</span> <span id="s1288">I went to her and I says, "Do you think I am going to harm you little girl?</span> <span id="s1289">Do you think I am going to be just like you people were?</span> <span id="s1290">I am not going to harm you, little girl.</span> <span id="s1291">You don't have to hide on the dog house."</span> <span id="s1292">She didn't say a word, you know, when I said this to her.</span> <span id="s1293">But this little girl was laying in that dog house hidden because she thought that...because this what they did to us, we're gonna to do to them.</span> <span id="s1294">And the same thing is when the Germans threw away those rifles by the train, I couldn't have picked up a rifle and killed all I wanted.</span> <span id="s1295">I couldn't even move.</span> <span id="s1296">I couldn't even pick that rifle up from the ground.</span> <span id="s1297">Probably maybe if I could, I would have feel maybe I would do it.</span> <span id="s1298">I couldn't even do this.</span> <span id="s1299">I couldn't even lift up the rifle that was laying on the ground because first of all they are very heavy and second of all, I am not the type to kill anybody or to shoot.</span> <span id="s1300">First, in...in...especially when the war was going on, you could have walked around in every home and do anything you wanted.</span> <span id="s1301">Nobody did those things.</span> <span id="s1302">Nobody did any revenging and killing just for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1303">I don't remember those things.</span> <span id="s1304">And I saw people like me...there was no men, only women and children, because older men were in the war.</span> <span id="s1305">Nobody did any revenge .</span> <span id="s1306">And after this, they took us...yah, the MPs stopped us...2 MPs...Yes...and asked where are we going.</span> <span id="s1307">So I told him we were on a field hospital from the army and now we gonna go.</span> <span id="s1308">We're looking for friends or family.</span> <span id="s1309">You know, do you say, "That's the only thing you had on your mind."</span> <span id="s1310">So they say, "You can't do that.</span> <span id="s1311">You are not allowed.</span> <span id="s1312">No.</span> <span id="s1313">You're now allowed to do this."</span> <span id="s1314">That was just war time.</span> <span id="s1315">You are not allowed to do this.</span> <span id="s1316">So they took us, put us in a jeep, and took us away, and point was already more people over there.</span> <span id="s1317">And this was that Camp Felderink.</span> <span id="s1318">(ph) This was in the time...when in that camp was still the German Army was still living in those barracks.</span> <span id="s1319">So, the American Army wants to put us in over there.</span> <span id="s1320">There was 30 people.</span> <span id="s1321">So we said, "We are not gonna live with them.</span> <span id="s1322">You chase them out.</span> <span id="s1323">You chase them out, we're gonna go in.</span> <span id="s1324">We're not gonna stay with them."</span> <span id="s1325">So anyway, they went out, and they moved us in.</span> <span id="s1326">And that's how that camp started to become a camp.</span> <span id="s1327">That's how that camp Felderink started to become a camp for DP.</span> <span id="s1328">You know a lot of people came from all kind liberation camps and they put them in.</span> <span id="s1329">.</span> <span id="s1330">in that camp.</span> <span id="s1331">And there was other camps, not only Felderink.</span> <span id="s1332">There was Saltzheim (ph).</span> <span id="s1333">There was Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1334">There was, uh, oh, there was a lot of them all around, you know.</span> <span id="s1335">All those people that were liberated from the Army.</span> <span id="s1336">And after awhile you start... even right after the liberation, people right away starting to...to make committee, to start learning, to make a newspaper.</span> <span id="s1337">There was printing a newspaper.</span> <span id="s1338">Right away they're looking for libraries and I remember like now, there was a newspaper printed with...with German ABC, but it's written in Yiddish, because there was no Yiddish words in Germany.</span> <span id="s1339">And who was doing this?</span> <span id="s1340">The Germans were printing that newspaper.</span> <span id="s1341">And all kind of little things shows to you that's how fast the people...the Jewish people raising up from the ashes, and right away they start building up a home.</span> <span id="s1342">And some people got married.</span> <span id="s1343">Some people find girlfriends.</span> <span id="s1344">Some people travel to Poland to see if anybody is alive.</span> <span id="s1345">Some people went to another camps and put little names on the walls.</span> <span id="s1346">I am looking for this and this and this man and maybe you saw my sister.</span> <span id="s1347">Her name was like this.</span> <span id="s1348">Maybe you saw my father.</span> <span id="s1349">I was in a camp with them.</span> <span id="s1350">And any place you went, you saw hundreds and hundreds of little pieces of paper written down with names in case somebody saw somebody.</span> <span id="s1351">And that's what kept us going to look.</span> <span id="s1352">Maybe you'll find somebody.</span> <span id="s1353">Oh, did you see this?</span> <span id="s1354">Or where is this?</span> <span id="s1355">And maybe you found somebody.</span> <span id="s1356">Oh yes, I saw him over there this camp.</span> <span id="s1357">Right away, you went and you...you went by train or by somebody to this camp and look up.</span> <span id="s1358">What that means after 5 years of torture!</span> <span id="s1359">What we went through for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1360">Only thing is because you were born Jewish.</span> <span id="s1361">The...they say...uh...I remember for instance in the time when I went from the ghetto...one for instance, and I was in the ghetto and I was working for a person in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1362">I was a kid.</span> <span id="s1363">He paid me 20 Zlotys a week.</span> <span id="s1364">He collected schmettes from those tailors, little leftovers.</span> <span id="s1365">He made big veils, and he give this...he sold it to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1366">Not he sold it...this was his job.</span> <span id="s1367">And I was working for him, so one day we loaded up a full truck of those things and we have to take them to the German place, and he had a piece of paper that's to let us out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1368">And a woman used to have the piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1369">She carried the piece of paper for six people.</span> <span id="s1370">And this was around Christmas 1940 or 41.</span> <span id="s1371">And I saw Polish people that were dancing.</span> <span id="s1372">Christmas is coming.</span> <span id="s1373">Everybody...the stores are nice, decorated and here the people being laying on the street swollen from hunger...we haven't got a piece of bread to eat...and everyday they take out thousands of people and they bury them in mass graves and here on the other side of the world, life goes on like it's a normal thing.</span> <span id="s1374">Life went on so normal.</span> <span id="s1375">And...and one day, that woman must have went shopping.</span> <span id="s1376">She left that standing on the street, and here we stand 6 people.</span> <span id="s1377">I remember like now.</span> <span id="s1378">Six people destined to death, and here that woman walked away with a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1379">And what will happen if any German comes along and asks what we're doing here, and we're going to tell him that some woman that has a piece of paper and this piece of paper says these six people have a right to stay here.</span> <span id="s1380">So that means 6 people's lives depends on a little piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1381">That was our destiny.</span> <span id="s1382">So finally that woman came.</span> <span id="s1383">It was like Mesiah came.</span> <span id="s1384">So that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1386">Hold the
