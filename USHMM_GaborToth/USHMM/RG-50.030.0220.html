<p><span id="s13">Q: Would you tell me your name please?</span> <span id="s14">A: I'm Steven Springfield.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Where were you born and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born January 30th, 1923 in Riga, Latvia.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Will you tell me about, something about your parents?</span> <span id="s18">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Uh my father owned a junior department store in Latvia, in Riga.</span> <span id="s21">Originally he worked as a salesman and slowly improved himself and was opened, able to open his own business.</span> <span id="s22">He was, he was selling ladies sports clothes and uh my mother worked in the business with him.</span> <span id="s23">She used to style the clothing.</span> <span id="s24">At that time uh there was no wholesale buying and all the inventory used to be produced by seamstresses who used to come to the store after it was closed in the evening and my mother used to give them out the work and discuss the various fashions and they did, did the work at their houses and used to bring it back and this is the way we we acquired inventory.</span> <span id="s25">And my mother used to go once in a while to Paris to get some styles, to copy styles and and she was working hand-in-hand with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What was what was your family life like as a child, growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well, the general situation in Latvia before the 2nd World War - Latvia was an independent country from 1918 to 1940.</span> <span id="s28">And even though there was some anti-Semitism prevalent, the Jewish people had had many cultural activities.</span> <span id="s29">We we had many Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s30">We had Jewish museums, Jewish theaters and a very active cultural and social life.</span> <span id="s31">my father and mother worked very very hard in order to provide a decent standard of living to the family and give their children the best possible education.</span> <span id="s32">We went to private schools.</span> <span id="s33">, as a matter of fact private German schools until 1933 when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s34">Then all the Jewish people demonstratively took their children out of the German schools and I started attending the Hebrew</span></p> <p><span id="s35">01:03: school, Gymnasion Ivrith, and I visited the school.</span> <span id="s36">I was attending the school until 1940.</span> <span id="s37">My brother went to a different school which was called Ezra School which was also, was not Hebrew but it was also diversified in various languages.</span> <span id="s38">And we we had a very interesting social life.</span> <span id="s39">We belonged to a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s40">we were very much interested in Palestine and most of our young people used to volunteer to go in the kibbutz whenever possible.</span> <span id="s41">And we were strong supporters of the Zionist movement at that time.</span> <span id="s42">Our social life was very active and we had really had a nice a nice growing up period.</span> <span id="s43">And all this of course changed when in 1940, when the Soviet Union occupied our country.</span> <span id="s44">overnight things were not the same anymore.</span> <span id="s45">first of all my father lost his business.</span> <span id="s46">There was no private enterprise allowed under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s47">One day somebody came into our business and asked my father for the key and that was it.</span> <span id="s48">And my father had to go and work in the lumber factory, after all those years trying to build the business and provide a future for his family - all of a sudden everything was gone.</span> <span id="s49">All our Zionist organizations were closed immediately.</span> <span id="s50">It was forbidden to have any kind of nationalist groups under threat of incarceration.</span> <span id="s51">Even the Hebrew schools were closed because the Soviet Union does not recognize Hebrew as as a Jewish language.</span> <span id="s52">That that is nationalist and anything which is nationalist is forbidden.</span> <span id="s53">So life changed dramatically.</span> <span id="s54">In addition they they arrested five thousand prominent Jewish families from Latvia and sent them to Siberia, their only crime being that they were capitalists.</span> <span id="s55">They had large business and all that.</span> <span id="s56">And that took all of 1940 until 1941.</span> <span id="s57">we had heard, we had heard already about things transpiring in Germany and in Austria.</span> <span id="s58">We had heard rumor about persecution against Jews, even Jews being sent to concentration camps and all that, but nobody really believed that these things would lead eventually to mass murder or mass persecutions against Jews, so when when the war finally broke out on the end of June, June 22nd, Germany declared</span></p> <p><span id="s59">01:06:20 war on the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s60">the German army swept through the Baltic states, within eight days occupied the Baltic states and there was very little time to make up one's mind whether to stay behind or to leave with the retreating Russian army.</span> <span id="s61">We had a discussion about it in our living room and my father felt very very strongly that it is a temporary situation.</span> <span id="s62">Yes, there might be some privileges which will be taken away from the Jews and there might be a certain amount of persecutions, but nobody in their right mind could ever imagine what was to come, so my father said we're going to stick it out.</span> <span id="s63">We're going to stay.</span> <span id="s64">So we did - that's the reason why we stayed behind.</span> <span id="s65">Some of our friends left with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s66">the men were taken immediately into the Army and most of them died fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s67">Some of them were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s68">Some of them were sent to inner Russia and some of them survived and came back after the war.</span> <span id="s69">The minute the Germans occupied Latvia and particularly Riga on July 1st, 1941, the Latvian population, the Latvian civilian population, turned against their neighbors, the Jews.</span> <span id="s70">Anti-Semitism, as I said, was always prevalent, but the year occupation by the Soviet Union increased anti-Semitism by so much because as usual the Jews were used as a scapegoat and the Latvian civilian population accused the Jews of being the culprit of bringing communism to their country.</span> <span id="s71">And that is why immediately, when the Russians pulled out, the German civilian population started persecution, persecuting Jews.</span> <span id="s72">They, before even the Germans had a chance to institute any kind of change, the the Latvians used to sweep through the houses, used to drag people out, used to murder, plunder, rape, everything, in the last, even the last the first few days.</span> <span id="s73">In this, in the first few weeks, our family was lucky because we had a maid who was living with us and she used to go out and do all the shopping for us, so we didn't have to venture into the streets, which was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s74">And she used to go buy food for us and and help us as much as she could.</span> <span id="s75">But then came out orders that every Jew was supposed to wear the star, the yellow star of David, left front and center back.</span> <span id="s76">And we were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s77">Like cattle we were driven into the gutter.</span> <span id="s78">Not allowed to go to parks.</span> <span id="s79">Not allowed anything.</span> <span id="s80">It was a very very sad and nervous time because Jews were continuously, continuously arrested, taken to prison.</span> <span id="s81">Most of them never came back.</span> <span id="s82">Few later, a few weeks later, an order came out that all Jews have to get ready to be moved from their apartments into specially designated area called the ghetto.</span> <span id="s83">It was supposed to be in a dilapidated section of town where about four thousand poor Russian and Polish families lived.</span> <span id="s84">They vacated the premises and in their place thirty thousand Jews were brought.</span> <span id="s85">All we all we were allowed to take is what we could carry in small little hand-driven carriages.</span> <span id="s86">By October we all were supposed to be in the ghetto, and the gates were closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">01:10:40</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: How did your family prepare to go into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, we knew that there was really no possibility for us to do anything but to follow orders because the majority, the overwhelming majority of the Latvian civilian population, didn't have any kind of feelings for their neighbors, the Jews who who who who were struck with this particular disaster.</span> <span id="s90">And there was no chance of getting help from anybody.</span> <span id="s91">So when the day came, we just, sad as it was, packed up a few little things which we could carry and we - I remember the day very well.</span> <span id="s92">It was about a mile and a half from our house to the ghetto, and we carried a few pieces each and had a little wagon which we pushed and took a few bare necessities, what we could carry, and we made the transition from our apartment to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s93">In the ghetto of course, the situation was disastrous because we had to share - in the ghetto we were assigned a room to share with another family.</span> <span id="s94">One room.</span> <span id="s95">Every apartment, a two or three room apartment usually was occupied by six or seven families.</span> <span id="s96">And the ghetto was guarded on the outside by the Latvian military guards.</span> <span id="s97">We had in the ghetto a civilian administration which was in charge of the sanitation, in charge of police, employment agency and whatever, and every morning people used to line up and the German or Latvian guards came and took people to work.</span> <span id="s98">At night they used to bring them back.</span> <span id="s99">my mother, my brother and I were working at that time for a German police unit called BDO, which is translated into German: "Befehlshaber der Ordnungspolizei".</span> <span id="s100">We were, my brother and I were doing menial labor.</span> <span id="s101">My mother was working for the for the chief in in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s102">She cooking for his family, which enabled her once in a while to get some extra food to help to support the family.</span> <span id="s103">My father of course stayed home and he did the the the menial chores in the house in so far and so at night we used to come back, but all this took a very very short time.</span> <span id="s104">That is from October till November.</span> <span id="s105">On November 27th, the orders came out that people who live in a certain section of the ghetto supposed to line up on the streets the next morning and they will be sent to a different camp.</span> <span id="s106">And of course all kinds of rumors started sweeping the ghetto.</span> <span id="s107">Nobody was sure what's to come and everybody was concerned and worried and but then, after lining up on the 27th, they sent every...everybody home again.</span> <span id="s108">But a day later, on the 29th, thousands of Latvian and German police came into the ghetto, drunk, most of them drunk - shooting, chasing everybody out.</span> <span id="s109">Raus.</span> <span id="s110">Everybody raus.</span> <span id="s111">Schnell, schnell.</span> <span id="s112">They chased everybody out.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Whoever couldn't walk was shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s114">Children, women, elderly men, on the street.</span> <span id="s115">And German officers were walking around and telling the elderly and the weak and the ones who couldn't walk very well that they will provide transportation for them.</span> <span id="s116">They, it would be much easier for them and they provided special blue buses.</span> <span id="s117">At that time we did not know what was happening to them, but they were chased through certain</span></p> <p><span id="s118">01:15:30 sections of town into the forest, a place called Rumbola and there Russian prisoners of war had prepared large graves, mass graves, and when the people got there they were told to undress, put their shoe in one pile their shoes in one pile, clothing in another pile, driven to the edges of this mass grave, and machine-gunned.</span> <span id="s119">It was going on all night and the next day.</span> <span id="s120">Fifteen thousand of our people were massacred in that particular day.</span> <span id="s121">My brother and I were taken with a group of other men and told to go to a certain place where they established a small ghetto of four thousand able-bodied men, and we were immediately separated from the rest of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s122">My father chose to stay at that time with my mother, but somehow - they lived in a different part of town, so they were spared the first murder.</span> <span id="s123">It didn't last long however, and on December 8th, they started the same thing all over again.</span> <span id="s124">And my father came over to visit my my brother and myself, wanted to go back and all of a sudden they closed, they closed the ghetto and he was stuck.</span> <span id="s125">He couldn't go back to my mother because he really wanted to be with my mother, so that's how my father stayed with us, and that particular day my mother with most of the rest of the ghetto were taken out.</span> <span id="s126">Another eleven thousand, five hundred were massacred.</span> <span id="s127">There was another small Aktion the next day of five hundred.</span> <span id="s128">There were within a very short time, two weeks, twenty-seven thousand people massacred.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: How did you hear about your mother's death and what did you do?</span> <span id="s130">01:17:50</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Well, as a matter of fact we, even after it happened, we were not sure.</span> <span id="s132">There were all kinds of rumors circulating what had happened to them, because the civilian population we didn't have any contact with.</span> <span id="s133">We didn't know for sure what was happened.</span> <span id="s134">All we knew that my mother was taken away in the second aktion with another eleven thousand five hundred people.</span> <span id="s135">We were still hoping against hope that maybe it was some kind of a different labor camp where she was taken to.</span> <span id="s136">Nobody was sure but but after a while, the the real picture started emerging - that it it was just a disaster, that they were just murdered and there was no hope of anybody coming back.</span> <span id="s137">And of course my father and us were totally devastated.</span> <span id="s138">A lot of tears, a lot of crying, saying kaddish after my mother, but really there was not, nothing nothing much one could do at those those at this time.</span> <span id="s139">I remember while they were taking out those people from the ghetto, I was standing behind the barbed wire and I saw those wild animals, those drunk Latvian and German soldiers beating, killing in the most brutal and barbaric way.</span> <span id="s140">I saw a woman walking with a child, with a baby in her arms, and somehow she slipped and the baby fell out of her arms.</span> <span id="s141">The Latvian policeman grabbed the baby, held it by its legs and put a bullet through the head, and when the mother started pleading with him and crying, he shot the mother on the spot.</span> <span id="s142">I saw that just in front of me.</span> <span id="s143">So when I saw that I had no doubt in my mind what was happening to our people.</span> <span id="s144">And it was the futility of the situation which made me raise my eyes to the sky, say my God, it just cannot be.</span> <span id="s145">Human beings cannot do that to other people.</span> <span id="s146">It's just impossible.</span> <span id="s147">Day had turned to night.</span> <span id="s148">People became worse than animals, blood-thirsty without any pity, any feelings for their fellow human beings, and the Latvian civilian population and I must get the record straight, the overwhelming majority of them just couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s149">They were hanging out the windows and they knew what was going on, and the majority of them couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s150">Yes, there was some exceptions.</span> <span id="s151">A few people even risked their lives to help their fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s152">But a percentage and it was so minute and so small that it really doesn't amount to anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">After these big exterminations of November and December, life went on in the small ghetto where just four thousand of us able-bodied men were left, and a few hundred women were kept in a special house away from us.</span> <span id="s154">Then the Jews from Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Lithuania started arriving.</span> <span id="s155">The majority of them were sent immediately to their death.</span> <span id="s156">Some of them were brought to our camp, to our ghetto in the in the place of of our people who were executed.</span> <span id="s157">And every day new shipments kept arriving.</span> <span id="s158">And as time went on, we got to know them, and in the beginning there was a certain understandable</span></p> <p><span id="s159">01:22:20 resentment from the Latvian Jews because somehow we felt that we had to make room for them, and when when you are emotionally overwhelmed by happenings, you don't think rational and you blame the the new arrivals to to a certain extent about what had transpired.</span> <span id="s160">But soon we became friends with them and even though we were separated by barbed wire, we had contacts with them being that they had also women and girls, and in our camp there was only men.</span> <span id="s161">The contact came, used to be boyfriend-girlfriend relationships and all that, and a certain amount of social life under those primitive circumstances took place.</span> <span id="s162">My brother and I, who used to in in in in pre-war times belong to a band, used to come to, on Sundays we used to go the German ghetto used to call it, and have social meetings and and sing and and even dance a little bit, just, you know, just to pass the time away, and , you know, life was going on and everybody was trying to do the best he could under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s163">(pause) A lot of my friends from from pre-war friends volunteered to join the Jewish police force in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s164">The Jewish police force was there for the purpose of keeping order within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s165">They had no weapons of course, nothing.</span> <span id="s166">They just keep order, make sure that the sanitation is properly done, that they that they maintain order.</span> <span id="s167">There there's no criminal activities whatsoever, and my first reaction, my brother's and I when they asked for volunteers, we wanted very much to volunteer for that too, because it meant have a uniform, have a little bit larger rations of food, not to have to go to work in the city, be inside the ghetto and all that, but my father, God bless him, was very much against it.</span> <span id="s168">He says I don't want you to volunteer.</span> <span id="s169">Just do whatever you have do, do your work, and don't be in the forefront and try to keep a low profile.</span> <span id="s170">Little did we know that indirectly that saved our lives later on because as life was</span></p> <p><span id="s171">01:25: going on in the ghetto, and as our situation started to become hopeless, some people started thinking of resistance.</span> <span id="s172">I was not directly involved but I knew about it because I had a cousin in the ghetto who was directly involved.</span> <span id="s173">They were smuggling guns and other military equipment into the ghetto, with the sole purpose of whenever it comes to it, that we will not go to the slaughter voluntarily.</span> <span id="s174">We'll fight back as much as we can.</span> <span id="s175">As it happens many times, somehow the Germans got wind of it.</span> <span id="s176">And till today we still don't know exactly how, but the fact is they came in, in the ghetto one day, and they discovered the arms.</span> <span id="s177">And immediately everybody who was there in that particular apartment was arrested.</span> <span id="s178">So were many other ones, and nobody ever saw them anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">And a week later, they took, they lined up the whole police force of forty-five young, of our youngest and bravest men, most of them were close friends of mine, and the German officer who was in charge of the of the ghetto said to them that they're holding them directly responsible for not maintaining order in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">And they took them out to a to a big place in front of the ghetto and they machined them all, machine-gunned them all to death, forty-five of them.</span> <span id="s181">One of them escaped somehow, but later on they caught him too, so not one of them is alive today.</span> <span id="s182">One night when I came back from work with my brother, we heard the news.</span> <span id="s183">And it was devastating, but we first realized that by not letting us join this police force my father had saved our lives at that particular time.</span> <span id="s184">So life was progressing in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s185">On and off they would come again and take away so many hundreds of people - whoever couldn't work, whoever was elderly, whoever was sick - never to be seen again.</span> <span id="s186">And finally in 1943, the order came out that the ghetto will be liquidated.</span> <span id="s187">And the ghetto</span></p> <p><span id="s188">01:28:00 population will be transferred to a concentration camp on the outskirts of Riga called Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s189">They didn't liquidate the ghetto all at once.</span> <span id="s190">Used to came an order, tomorrow we'll need five hundred men.</span> <span id="s191">Then three days later another two hundred men.</span> <span id="s192">So every time an order came out for so many people, every building and every family had to supply a certain amount of people, and everybody of course wanted to stay in the ghetto as long as possible because as bad as things were in the ghetto, we knew that Kaiserwald concentration camp is going to be much worse and we had heard already rumors to that effect, so when the order came that that in our house so many people have to be volunteered to go my brother and father and I consulted.</span> <span id="s193">One of us had to go and I felt that I was the younger one.</span> <span id="s194">I was the stronger one.</span> <span id="s195">My father was out of the question.</span> <span id="s196">It was between my brother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I felt that I would have a better chance to survive in a concentration camp and I I really felt that somehow my brother who is who was not in excellent good health at that time already, would have a more difficult time.</span> <span id="s199">And we discussed it and in the beginning of course my brother didn't want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s200">He wanted to to pull straws or things like that, but I said no, it's OK.</span> <span id="s201">I will go.</span> <span id="s202">So next day, about three hundred of us were sent to Kaiserwald, and Kaiserwald was a very very difficult place.</span> <span id="s203">Was a hell hole.</span> <span id="s204">Inside the camp we were ruled by criminals, by German criminals who were also prisoners in the camp, but they were above us.</span> <span id="s205">And they used to beat the hell out of us and food was very little.</span> <span id="s206">See every day they used to line up in the morning, at five o'clock in the morning in the cold winter, without any clothing, and used to, they got so many people to go to work.</span> <span id="s207">And many of those German war criminals were were murderers.</span> <span id="s208">They were in prison for murder, and they were in charge of us, so there was one particular guy, we used to call him Mr. X.</span> <span id="s209">He used to take a group of hundred, two hundred people out to work every day, and for sport every day used to drown one or two of them, just for the sport.</span> <span id="s210">Used to bring back less than he took out.</span> <span id="s211">Fortunately it didn't last too long for me.</span> <span id="s212">I was able to volunteer to a group which was supposed to to go a different work camp, and in about three or four weeks I was able to get out of Kaiserwald and go to this camp which was about a couple of miles away from Kaiserwald, and there I was working for a unit called TWL, which is in German Truppen Wirtschafts Lager.</span> <span id="s213">It it was a unit which supplied the clothing and the food for the German army.</span> <span id="s214">We were working there in assorting clothing and many other duties as far as the warehouse is concerned.</span> <span id="s215">A few weeks later I found out that my brother and father also were sent to Kaiserwald, that the ghetto had been liquidated, so they were in Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s216">I was working in this TWL and I was doing everything I could to try to get them to join me, because the</span></p> <p><span id="s217">1:32:00 conditions in Kaiserwald were horrible and I knew that particularly my father couldn't survive too long there.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What kind of things did you try to get them to join you?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, there always used to be some contact with with Kaiserwald, and I used to try to get some messages to them to try to volunteer.</span> <span id="s220">The minute they asked for volunteers to come to us, to volunteer to come to our to my camp.</span> <span id="s221">Also every couple of weeks they used to take from our work camp people who had to go to the dentist, problems with their teeth - the dentist was in Kaiserwald, and what he would do is when you used to come with a toothache he just would pull your tooth, and when I heard about this I volunteered.</span> <span id="s222">I said I had a toothache and I volunteered because I wanted to see my brother and my father and see them personally.</span> <span id="s223">So that morning when I was working in the clothing depot I took some socks from the depot.</span> <span id="s224">I hid them underneath my pants and at night we were lined up, a kommando of about fifteen, twenty people ready to go to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s225">Low and behold we were stopped at the gate.</span> <span id="s226">Germans control.</span> <span id="s227">When I heard that I knew that I'm going to have a lot of difficulties to say the least, and I had to get rid of those (pause) socks.</span> <span id="s228">I was able to establish contact with a German, not with a German - it was a Latvian guard outside the barbed wire and I told him in Latvian, I have some socks.</span> <span id="s229">Take them.</span> <span id="s230">Keep them.</span> <span id="s231">He did.</span> <span id="s232">I was able to sneak the socks to him and get rid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">However when I looked at my group, all of a sudden there were some socks which somebody else had thrown down on the ground, and I had told the people who were with us, fellow Jews, that I was carrying some socks for my brother and my father, so the people felt that they were my socks, and when I told them that I got rid of my socks they didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s234">And when the Germans saw the socks laying on the ground, they said who, who do they belong to.</span> <span id="s235">In the beginning I wasn't going to volunteer because I, there was no reason for me.</span> <span id="s236">They wasn't mine.</span> <span id="s237">But I was pressured in into admit, to confess by my fellow Jews because they really felt that it was mine and they said if I'm not going to volunteer, everybody was going to be punished.</span> <span id="s238">I had no choice, and I stepped forward and I said they were mine.</span> <span id="s239">And next, immediately I was given a merciless beating.</span> <span id="s240">I was arrested.</span> <span id="s241">I was dragged to a bunker where they used to keep the people before execution.</span> <span id="s242">I was almost unconscious.</span> <span id="s243">I was thrown into the bunker and I blacked out.</span> <span id="s244">A couple of hours later I must have woken up.</span> <span id="s245">It was still completely dark.</span> <span id="s246">It was night and first I did not realize what had transpired.</span> <span id="s247">Slowly it started coming back to me and I started to realize that I was doomed.</span> <span id="s248">People were executed for much less than that.</span> <span id="s249">I just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s250">I was bleeding.</span> <span id="s251">I was holding my head.</span> <span id="s252">I was aching all over, but I just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s253">I was twenty years old, and I just couldn't believe that this was going to the end.</span> <span id="s254">All kinds of</span></p> <p><span id="s255">01:36:30 thoughts started flashing through my mind - the kind of life I was hoping to build one day for myself and it all goes down the drain.</span> <span id="s256">It's not going to happen.</span> <span id="s257">An hour later I heard footsteps nearing the bunker where I was incarcerated.</span> <span id="s258">I was a hundred percent sure they were Germans coming to execute me.</span> <span id="s259">The door swung open and there were two Germans, officers in uniform and the camp elder, the Jew who was the camp elder.</span> <span id="s260">His name was David Kagan, and as they entered the bunker, before the Germans had a chance to draw their guns, the camp Aeltester started beating me, saying you lousy son of a gun, he says.</span> <span id="s261">How dare you to steal from the Germans, and kicked me and beat me and kicked me and beat me.</span> <span id="s262">I started bleeding profusely from all over my body and he beat me into unconsciousness.</span> <span id="s263">But somehow, ironically, that saved my life.</span> <span id="s264">He beat me so much that the Germans assumed that I was dead or close to dead.</span> <span id="s265">They just turned around and walked out, which I was told later because I was unconscious.</span> <span id="s266">I was laying in this bunker for another two or three days and then finally the camp elder came and got me and took me back to camp and it is something which I have never forgotten.</span> <span id="s267">Mr.Kagan who did not have a very good reputation from everybody because a lot of people felt that he was too strict and sometimes too merciless, but I must, if I want to be honest I really have to admit that if not for him I wouldn't be alive today.</span> <span id="s268">Another few months passed.</span> <span id="s269">It was 1944 now.</span> <span id="s270">And even though we did not have any radios or any newspapers, the news kept trickling in to us that the tide of the war had turned.</span> <span id="s271">The Russians had won the battle of Stalingrad and the Germans were starting to retreat.</span> <span id="s272">And of course for us it meant some kind of a glimmer of hope.</span> <span id="s273">Perhaps, perhaps the Russians will be liberating us before the Germans have a chance to kill us.</span> <span id="s274">In the meantime, periodically the Germans would come into our camp, line everybody up in front of a table where one of the Germans would sit.</span> <span id="s275">Everybody had to undress naked and walk in front of him, and if there was something he would like on your body, any scar or anything like that, you went to the left, and left meant certain death.</span> <span id="s276">And my father who was an invalid and who was with us at that time yet still on many occasions he would have been doomed if he wouldn't have somehow we're able to save him by not letting him go into the line, by sneaking him out.</span> <span id="s277">When once I remember my father was taken out and and sent to the left, and he was still standing there and waiting the truck to take him away, and the German guard was walking back and forth, and as he turned his back I snuck in.</span> <span id="s278">I grabbed my father and pulled him out of there which at that time saved his life.</span> <span id="s279">So my brother and I and my father were still in this particular camp when 19...when the fall of 1944 came, and that was when we started</span></p> <p><span id="s280">01:44:00 already hearing rumors that the Russians were getting closer and closer.</span> <span id="s281">And one day we woke up and we heard already the Russian guns and Russian planes and we could, you know, we were starting to to have hope against hope that maybe, maybe salvation is near.</span> <span id="s282">If I were what is what is it was not meant to be.</span> <span id="s283">It was not meant to be.</span> <span id="s284">We were all driven out of our barracks, lined up with the Germans and taken to the port where ferries was standing by, and we chased on to those ferries and taken by boat from Riga to Danzig, Germany into concentration camp Stuthoff, and we heard, after we arrived in Danzig, when we heard that we were going to Stuthoff, we were devastated because Stuthoff was a camp which was very well known as one of the worst.</span> <span id="s285">There was no food.</span> <span id="s286">Was a lot of brutality, a lot of killings and hardly anybody esc...got out got out of Stuthoff, so the three of us, my brother, my father and I, went to Stuthoff and spent several weeks there.</span> <span id="s287">The conditions in Stuthoff were beyond any description.</span> <span id="s288">People were dying left and right from hunger.</span> <span id="s289">People - you woke up in the morning - next to you people were dead, emaciated.</span> <span id="s290">And the condition was deteriorating by the day because the tide of the war had turned and as bad as it was before, now the Germans were letting the anger out on the few remaining Jews because they were, it was clear to them by this time they were loosing the war.</span> <span id="s291">A few weeks after we arrived in Stuthoff, we were all lined up one day and a German officer said they are looking for volunteers to work in a German ship building firm in Danzig called Schiff ??</span> <span id="s292">Werke.</span> <span id="s293">My brother and I and my father volunteered, but as my father was going across to join us, the German officer noticed that he was invalid.</span> <span id="s294">He was dragging a leg as a result of scarlet fever which he had in his youth.</span> <span id="s295">The minute he noticed that he says you cannot go.</span> <span id="s296">Back.</span> <span id="s297">My brother and I started pleading, it's our father.</span> <span id="s298">We have to go together.</span> <span id="s299">Just to spite, he says you're going and he's staying here, and no matter how much we begged and no matter how much we pleaded and cried, it did not help.</span> <span id="s300">We were kicked and beaten and forced to leave my father.</span> <span id="s301">It was clear to my brother and myself that the minute my father would be left in Stuthoff he would be doomed.</span> <span id="s302">And we were we were absolutely heart-broken to leave him there, because we knew it was going to be the end.</span> <span id="s303">But we were forced to do it and that's how we left Stuthoff.</span> <span id="s304">From Stuthoff we were taken to a camp called Burgram ?</span> <span id="s305">(ph) and from there every morning at 4:30 we were put on a train and taken to the shipbuilding company to work there.</span> <span id="s306">And that was going on for a couple of months...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Tell us about the work you did.</span> <span id="s308">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, they were they were building submarines there and we had to carry the heavy steel parts and hand it to the mechanics and to the engineers, whoever wanted them, and we were guarded by German soldiers all day long.</span> <span id="s310">The working conditions left a lot to be desired, but we used to get an extra piece of bread so it was still better than staying in camp and not working.</span> <span id="s311">Besides while going to work we could always have some communication with the outside world, learn what was happening, find out that the war has definitely turned, that the Germans were retreating on all fronts.</span> <span id="s312">We also learned that Latvia had been liberated and we missed it by not more than a few days.</span> <span id="s313">My brother got sick in that particular camp and he could not go to work.</span> <span id="s314">He had a had a problem with his stomach and with his legs and he was staying in a makeshift hospital there in this camp and I kept trying to look in on him and see that he's OK.</span> <span id="s315">One day in the hospital he saw a glass with white liquid and assuming it was milk he drank it.</span> <span id="s316">And it was rat poison.</span> <span id="s317">And that completely</span></p> <p><span id="s318">01:47:21 destroyed his stomach.</span> <span id="s319">Completely destroyed his stomach.</span> <span id="s320">He was very very sick from from then on.</span> <span id="s321">He was in very very bad shape.</span> <span id="s322">And to make things worse a few weeks later the order came we are moving out because the Russians were obviously coming closer.</span> <span id="s323">That was the winter of 1944-45.</span> <span id="s324">It was a very very - the climate was very cold.</span> <span id="s325">We were driven on foot through the German countryside.</span> <span id="s326">It was cold.</span> <span id="s327">It was snow.</span> <span id="s328">My brother could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s329">I supported him as much as I could.</span> <span id="s330">It got so bad that he pleaded with me to let him go.</span> <span id="s331">Don't he says.</span> <span id="s332">Let me die.</span> <span id="s333">I I cannot, I I really cannot handle it anymore.</span> <span id="s334">I I want to die.</span> <span id="s335">Leave me here.</span> <span id="s336">But it was it was clear that the minute I let him go, he would be shot on the spot because anybody who couldn't keep up with the march was shot on the spot, and you would walk on the road - you could see corpses all over because it was an actual death march.</span> <span id="s337">I just couldn't give in.</span> <span id="s338">I just couldn't drop my brother.</span> <span id="s339">I carried him.</span> <span id="s340">I schlepped him.</span> <span id="s341">I kept talking to him.</span> <span id="s342">I'd say we're not too far away from salvation.</span> <span id="s343">You can't give up now.</span> <span id="s344">You can't give up now.</span> <span id="s345">Anyway, somehow I was able to schlep him to the next camp which was a place called Gottendorf in eastern Pomerania.</span> <span id="s346">There the conditions of course got from bad to worse because the Germans didn't have enough to eat themselves anymore because the armies were retreating and the Jews didn't get anything to eat.</span> <span id="s347">If we got a piece of potato peel we were lucky.</span> <span id="s348">We used to press it against the little oven which you had in the barracks and and roast a potato peel.</span> <span id="s349">Every morning you used to wake up in the barracks - the fellow on the left, upstairs on the right used to be dead.</span> <span id="s350">It was just a disaster.</span> <span id="s351">It was, you know, it it - another few weeks and there wouldn't be any camp.</span> <span id="s352">And in all that I still was able once in a while when they asked for volunteers to go out of the camp, come in contact with civilian population in my work, once in a while got a little piece of bread which I could, I would I would be able to bring to my brother who who really didn't get anything to eat in camp, because he was not in a position to be able to get out.</span> <span id="s353">In the meantime it was 1945, (pause) March.</span> <span id="s354">March 1945.</span> <span id="s355">My brother was near death.</span> <span id="s356">He was very very sick.</span> <span id="s357">They had a little tent on the side of the camp where they sent the very sick people there, and they were just laying there and dying.</span> <span id="s358">Once in a while I used to come in and bring him something, but what they needed we couldn't give them - medication, any medical help or anything.</span> <span id="s359">Beginning of March I started feeling bad myself and I got sick.</span> <span id="s360">Typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s361">I started, I tried to carry on as long as I could, but I just couldn't do it anymore.</span> <span id="s362">And one morning the order came out again we are leaving the camp.</span> <span id="s363">We are marching out again.</span> <span id="s364">I couldn't march anymore.</span> <span id="s365">I couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s366">I took all my strength to drag myself to the little hut where my brother was laying, and I walked into the hut.</span> <span id="s367">I laid next to my brother.</span> <span id="s368">If we're going to die, we're going to die together.</span> <span id="s369">In the meantime everybody who could walk was lined up and marched out of the camp.</span> <span id="s370">We could hear them shooting and we could hear them yelling, but all of a sudden it was quiet.</span> <span id="s371">They were gone, except for two German guards who were left behind with the instructions to shoot the sick fifteen minutes after everybody else leaves.</span> <span id="s372">We were so sick at that time, hallucinating - we didn't even know what was going on.</span> <span id="s373">(Pause) All of a sudden, we could hear shooting, gunfire.</span> <span id="s374">The two German guards ran into our hut and said to us, we have instructions to shoot you, but we won't if you won't give us away to the Russians, because the Russians are coming in.</span> <span id="s375">They took off their German uniforms, put on our striped prisoner clothes, and laid down right next to us.</span> <span id="s376">A few minutes later we could hear</span></p> <p><span id="s377">01:54: some more shooting and before you know it, the were Russian tanks, Russian tanks moved into camp.</span> <span id="s378">All of a sudden a young Russian officer wearing a short leather coat and I remember it so well like it happened yesterday, with a machine-gun strung around his waist, walked in, looked at us and a seasoned Army veteran broke out in tears and started crying.</span> <span id="s379">What have they done to you?</span> <span id="s380">He says: "Ikh bin a Yid.”</span> <span id="s381">And he says we will take revenge for you.</span> <span id="s382">For every one of you, we will get thousands of them.</span> <span id="s383">And somebody pointed out the two German guards who were laying next to us and they took them away immediately, and that was our liberation.</span> <span id="s384">That's how we were liberated.</span> <span id="s385">Yes, we had freedom, but many didn't survive the freedom.</span> <span id="s386">There was no medical help.</span> <span id="s387">Yes, there was some more food but our stomachs could not handle it.</span> <span id="s388">Many people died because of over-eating.</span> <span id="s389">The Russians couldn't be bothered with us.</span> <span id="s390">They had a war to fight.</span> <span id="s391">So all they told us is you stop the German refugees who are on the road, and you make them take you back to town into a hospital.</span> <span id="s392">Needless to say, the minute the Russians were gone the Germans couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s393">They left us laying there.</span> <span id="s394">Finally a Russian stopped the German horse and buggy and he said to them, you take them back to town, and if you don't we'll shoot you.</span> <span id="s395">So finally this German family or whoever they were took my brother and myself and another two guys, put them on their wagon, took us back to the town.</span> <span id="s396">The name of the town was Lauenburg, which was also in eastern Pomerania.</span> <span id="s397">The town was in the center of fighting.</span> <span id="s398">There was a lot of shooting, a lot of bombing from airplanes and everything.</span> <span id="s399">The the Germans dropped us off in the center of town - just dropped us and took off.</span> <span id="s400">We were staying in the middle of town.</span> <span id="s401">We could not walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">01:57: We didn't know what to do, how, what, so we was crawling on our legs and hands, hands and legs until we came to a building.</span> <span id="s403">In the meantime it had gotten dark.</span> <span id="s404">All we could do was feel.</span> <span id="s405">We didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s406">We opened the door to a building, crawled in, found some kind of a couch or a bed and laid down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: We've got to change tapes, and this is a good place to do it.</span> <span id="s408">We're just going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s412">We're back.</span> <span id="s413">You've collapsed on the sofa.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Several hours later we smelled smoke.</span> <span id="s415">The Russians were burning the whole town down and as sick as we were and as tired as we were, we had to crawl out of the building again and look for other shelter.</span> <span id="s416">Finally we found a little place and we collapsed there and then the long tedious process of recovery started to take place.</span> <span id="s417">Took us months.</span> <span id="s418">As a matter of fact I recouped a little faster and...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Tell me - just a minute though.</span> <span id="s420">What was it like?</span> <span id="s421">Tell me something about where you were and what they moment was like as the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Well, we were, as I said we were in a little town in eastern Pomerania.</span> <span id="s423">The Russians were occupied with their march.</span> <span id="s424">They were going straight to Berlin they were telling us.</span> <span id="s425">So we had very little possibility to have any kind of a real contact with the Russians because they were only coming through.</span> <span id="s426">They were only coming through.</span> <span id="s427">All day long troops, tanks were coming through the town.</span> <span id="s428">But they left a certain amount of people behind for the running of the town and administration and all that and once I was able to get around again, the Russians did help us to get some food.</span> <span id="s429">My brother was very sick.</span> <span id="s430">We lived with two, we stayed in an apartment with two other friends of ours who were also liberated and one of my friends and myself, we were able to get around better so we used to go around.</span> <span id="s431">It it was a very unusual situation.</span> <span id="s432">We, at that time we really were not concerned about our new life, about thinking about the future.</span> <span id="s433">All we were concerned was getting enough food to eat and getting well again.</span> <span id="s434">We did not think about plans, where we going to go, whether we're going to go back to Latvia or</span></p> <p><span id="s435">02:03: whether not going to go back to Latvia.</span> <span id="s436">We really didn't give it much thought because all those years of of this incarceration and living under certain circumstances , you know, you you don't think the way a normal human being would think - that I have to start making plans about my future.</span> <span id="s437">All we're thinking in terms of just survival, day to day survival, and it took a considerable amount of time simply emotionally we were ready to start thinking about other things than just the day of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: How did you feel at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Well, of course we were very anxious to find out what happened to the rest of our families, whether there was still anybody alive, try to establish some kind of a contact.</span> <span id="s440">But our primary purpose was to really get back on our feet so we could function again.</span> <span id="s441">In addition, the Russians were taking any, every able-bodied person was taken into the army, and they couldn't care less whether you were in a concentration camp or not.</span> <span id="s442">Then they used to put you in a hospital, give you some care.</span> <span id="s443">The minute you could well enough they used to give you a uniform and a gun and away you went.</span> <span id="s444">Many people who were liberated at that time had to go to the Russian army and still in the last few months were killed on the Russian front, after surviving concentration camp for over four years.</span> <span id="s445">I slowly was starting to get a little better and we made contact with some Russian officers who were coming through town and they asked us whether we would like to work for them as interpreters, being that my brother and I speak fluently Russian and German, they asked us to to come with them to help them to deal with the with the civilian</span></p> <p><span id="s446">02:05: German population.</span> <span id="s447">And we accepted.</span> <span id="s448">We accepted.</span> <span id="s449">We felt that if if even if it was temporary, it was...we did not feel like going back to Riga right away for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s450">Was it you know, because we had emotional apprehensions about going back, what we were to find, but we just felt that in the meantime if we worked there, we'll be provided for and they'll take care of us.</span> <span id="s451">So we started working for them, and four or five months passed by and we were doing quite well...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Mostly interpreting between - you see, the Russians were running big German farms to get the food to the troops and the Germans were working for them.</span> <span id="s454">And the communication, we used to help to communicate between the Germans and the Russians.</span> <span id="s455">And we also - I was in charge of a warehouse.</span> <span id="s456">I was managing a warehouse for the Russians.</span> <span id="s457">My brother did something else.</span> <span id="s458">So we we had a pretty good job with the Russians.</span> <span id="s459">For for for a while they didn't bother us, you know, they pretty good to us, but four or five months later, maybe even less than four or five months, in the middle of the night, they arrested us, my brother and I. And we were not told why we are being arrested because under the communist system you are assumed guilty unless you're proven otherwise.</span> <span id="s460">In other words it's an opposite like it is in our system.</span> <span id="s461">So they don't give you any explanation when they</span></p> <p><span id="s462">02:07: arrest you.</span> <span id="s463">Just took us away, put us in prison, and later we found out that the reason we were arrested there was one Russian officer, a lieutenant, who was anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s464">He went back to the general and says the only reason the two Jews survived is because they were Nazi collaborators.</span> <span id="s465">Now as I said, they don't investigate whether it's true or not.</span> <span id="s466">They don't give you a chance to explain.</span> <span id="s467">Didn't give us a chance to prove that it's not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">They just arrested us.</span> <span id="s469">Put us in jail, with the most undesirable element, Russian element who fought in the well-known Vlasov army.</span> <span id="s470">It was army of Russian volunteers who fought against their own brothers, and we were sitting with those criminals.</span> <span id="s471">It just, it was it was hard to believe for us that after surviving over four years of German concentration camp, we would have to deal with that and truthfully speaking it wasn't much better than German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s472">We were kept under most inhuman conditions.</span> <span id="s473">My brother and I were separated.</span> <span id="s474">I was thrown in a room, in a Stall [stable] without windows.</span> <span id="s475">I got boils all over my body.</span> <span id="s476">I really felt that it was our end after all this time.</span> <span id="s477">It the situation looked hopeless.</span> <span id="s478">But somehow we were fortunate again in the respect that it was a Jewish major in the Russian army and his name was Auslaender and one day they called us to interrogate us and we told him that we went through concentration camp and what they are accusing us, we have we have hundreds and hundreds of witnesses who were with us to dispel any doubts and all we're interested is to go to Israel, on to Palestine.</span> <span id="s479">Somehow he felt pity and he let us go.</span> <span id="s480">Yes, it took some other doings to persuade him but our our our wives - we were married at that time already - yes, my wife was from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s481">She was brought to Riga from Hamburg and was in Riga in the ghetto and we had lost track of each other.</span> <span id="s482">After the war, while I was working for the Russians, I was able to find her somewheres wandering around in Germany, and I brought her to me.</span> <span id="s483">Her and her mother.</span> <span id="s484">And my brother had met a girl, Jewish girl, in Poland.</span> <span id="s485">At that time Pomerania, today it's Poland and he also got married.</span> <span id="s486">So they knew, the the the girls knew where we were incarcerated and were able to follow us, and somehow they were able to establish contact and also it took a little bribery to get us out of there.</span> <span id="s487">In addition, you know, to this major who felt pity on us, took a little certain amount of bribery.</span> <span id="s488">They</span></p> <p><span id="s489">02:10:40 let us go.</span> <span id="s490">They didn't give us any papers but they let us go.</span> <span id="s491">At that time my brother and I made up our mind that we're not going back to Latvia.</span> <span id="s492">We aren't going back to Riga after this experience.</span> <span id="s493">We didn't want any part of it.</span> <span id="s494">We didn't want any part of it.</span> <span id="s495">Said we're going to try to make it to to the West.</span> <span id="s496">So that was very very complicated.</span> <span id="s497">And first we went to a place called Stettin in Poland and there we were able to establish contacts with some Russian soldiers who smuggled us over the border also for bribes, smuggled us over the border into Berlin.</span> <span id="s498">I was I went with a special kind of a truck which delivered mail from Stettin to Berlin and the Russian soldiers made a business out of it.</span> <span id="s499">They hid people underneath the sacks of mail, and that's where I was laying and all the sacks of mail on top of me and that's the way I went over the border.</span> <span id="s500">My brother and the three ladies were smuggled in a different open truck with a Russian captain who was able to get them through and in Berlin we all met.</span> <span id="s501">We my sister-in-law was a native of Berlin from before the war and she was able to get an apartment in Berlin.</span> <span id="s502">It was 1946 and we stayed in Berlin for a little</span></p> <p><span id="s503">02:12:20 while, a few months, and then I applied for a visa through the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society [HIAS] and 1947, March 10th, 1947, I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s504">My brother stayed another six months in Berlin.</span> <span id="s505">He came six months later.</span> <span id="s506">Of course when we came to this country it wasn't easy, but I never took the attitude that anybody owes me something like some other people had, you know.</span> <span id="s507">And I was content to be here and have an opportunity to try to rebuild my life.</span> <span id="s508">We worked hard, two jobs, three jobs - whatever was necessary.</span> <span id="s509">My wife worked hard and slowly we kept rebuilding our lives.</span> <span id="s510">Family - my first son was born in 1950, and my second son, 1952.</span> <span id="s511">My oldest son Stewart is 39 years old today.</span> <span id="s512">My youngest son Charles is 37.</span> <span id="s513">I have since been divorced, after 29 years of marriage.</span> <span id="s514">I have remarried eight years ago to a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s515">My brother has had much much of tragedy even after the war.</span> <span id="s516">His first wife who was also a survivor, died in 1952 or '53 from a heart ailment and left him with a four year old son.</span> <span id="s517">He remarried a year later and was married to another woman for twenty-five years and she died from cancer.</span> <span id="s518">Now my brother has remarried again.</span> <span id="s519">He's married now for almost eight years to a very nice, charming woman.</span> <span id="s520">A few years back, quite a few years back, my dear friend Mr. Max Kaufmann who was the mainstay of Latvian Jews in this country, Mr. Max Kaufmann wrote a book about the destruction of Latvian Jewry about five years after the liberation and this book has been served, served as reference to many historians and many people who wrote books after that.</span> <span id="s521">He was a very close friend of my father and I felt almost like I would be his son.</span> <span id="s522">He used to always try to keep the remnants of the Latvian Jewry in this country together by arranging yearly memorials during December for the twenty-seven thousand Jews who were murdered.</span> <span id="s523">And he</span></p> <p><span id="s524">01:16:30 asked me to get involved, to help him.</span> <span id="s525">So maybe twenty years ago I got involved in that and I assisted him all through those years to go on with his work.</span> <span id="s526">Max Kaufmann died about five years ago, and I felt that it was most imperative for me to try to carry on with the work which he so bravely carried on for many years by himself.</span> <span id="s527">I called a few of my friends together from Latvia and we formed an organization called Jewish Survivors of Latvia.</span> <span id="s528">We try to pass on the legacy of the once beautiful Latvian Jewish community in Riga to our children and children's children.</span> <span id="s529">We also incorporate in our organization the new immigrants from Latvia who arrived who arrived in the last fifteen years and are still arriving today.</span> <span id="s530">I am involved.</span> <span id="s531">A lot of work which has to do with keeping the flame alive, perpetuating the heritage, trying to tell the world what was done to us and never let it forget it.</span> <span id="s532">I personally feel very very strongly when people ask me how come that so many died and and you didn't.</span> <span id="s533">Usually I feel, I answer is first of all it was a certain amount of luck.</span> <span id="s534">You had to have luck because no matter what you did, nobody can resist a bullet, but I also felt that a lot had to do with the fact that I was young and strong and also most important I felt that it was meant to be and I maybe I had a mission.</span> <span id="s535">Because I was fortunate enough to survive, I have a responsibility and mission to do my very best to try to tell the world what was done to us and what man's inhumanity can do, where hate and bigotry can lead to.</span> <span id="s536">When we start looking around us today, we are witnessing the awakening of anti-Semitism, of national anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union to a point where the million six hundred thousand Jews in the Soviet Union, they do not feel safe anymore.</span> <span id="s537">It's not anymore a question of looking for a better life.</span> <span id="s538">It's a question of being frightened.</span> <span id="s539">I have</span></p> <p><span id="s540">02:20: so people who I have met in the few months from Soviet Union and some as recently as last week from Latvia, there's hardly anybody today who does not consider getting out.</span> <span id="s541">We are unfortunately anti-Semitism as a result of the liberalization of the country, nationalism and with it anti-Semitism is rearing its ugly head again.</span> <span id="s542">And therefore I feel it's twice as important now not to leave one stone unturned to make the world aware of what is happening and to try and do everything possible not to let the same mistake to happen again, where the whole world stood by indifferently and watched our people being slaughtered.</span> <span id="s543">I feel as long as I possibly can I would love to go on with this important work whether it's in Israel, whether it's in this country, whether it's in Latvia or in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s544">Wherever I have a chance and opportunity to get involved I'm sure going to try.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s546">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s547">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Tell us how you met your first wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: I met my I met my wife in 1942 when she with another group was transported by rail from Hamburg, Germany to Riga.</span> <span id="s550">We became quite friendly and used to see each other quite often, had a relationship and spent some time together.</span> <span id="s551">However once they liquidated the ghetto, everybody was sent to a different directions.</span> <span id="s552">And I lost track of her for quite a long time until after the liberation and I was working for the Russians, I met</span></p> <p><span id="s553">02:23:15 somebody one day and was told they had seen my wife my girlfriend somewheres near Danzig.</span> <span id="s554">I went to the general, asked him for permission, and I went looking for her.</span> <span id="s555">And sure enough, it took me a little while - I found her.</span> <span id="s556">She was working in Danzig for a Russian general with her mother as interpreters.</span> <span id="s557">I was able to convince the German general, the Russian general excuse me, that I was married to her already, which I wasn't because I knew darned well that if I just say she's my girlfriend he'll never let her go but luckily they bought my statement.</span> <span id="s558">They understood and when he called them and says, he called my mother-in-law and asked her, does your daughter have a husband and she says yes, because she was smart enough to understand that it must be me who were looking for, so he let them go.</span> <span id="s559">He let them go and I took them with me to where we were staying and after we had the problem with the Russians and we decided not to go back to Latvia anymore, we went to, we decided to go to the West, on our way we stopped off in Danzig and we got married.</span> <span id="s560">My brother and I got married on the same day under the same Chupah under the most primitive circumstances.</span> <span id="s561">Friends of ours came, one friend came with half a lamb.</span> <span id="s562">One friend came with a a milk can of vodka and everybody brought something and we had like a real nice little wedding under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s563">And that's after we got married then we decided it's time to move on and that's when we came to Stettin, and from there to Berlin and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: When did you know for sure that your father was dead?</span> <span id="s565">You had been taken away and he was still in Stuthoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well, after the war we started of course looking for my father, trying to get some kind of information and one day we ran into somebody who was in the same barracks with him and he told us that right after my brother and I left Stuthoff, my father lost all will to live.</span> <span id="s567">He was emotionally devastated and under the circumstances not being able to work, the rations of food which he which he was getting was not enough to survive, so it was just a matter of time and he got sick in Stuthoff, typhoid, and he died in Stuthoff.</span> <span id="s568">We all actually had an eye-witness who told us the news that my father died in Stuthoff.</span> <span id="s569">I would like to mention that in September 1989, my brother and I decided to go back to Riga and one of the compelling reasons for us to go back</span></p> <p><span id="s570">02:27: to Riga was an emotional need to say kaddish, my mother's grave even though she did not have her private grave - it was a mass grave - but we still wanted to go back and we did go back and spent six days in Riga and for us it was an emotional holocaust.</span> <span id="s571">Yes, there were many pleasant experiences in Riga like visiting the new Jewish community which is twenty-six thousand strong today, satisfying an inner emotional need of paying tribute to our mother and saying kaddish at her grave.</span> <span id="s572">Also meeting our distant family which we still have in Latvia, in Riga and spending a few pleasant days with them.</span> <span id="s573">But also to witness the sad reminders of an era - walking on the street we were reminded of how we were driven as cattle in the gutter under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s574">When we passed by the street, certain buildings we were reminded where Jews were beaten, raped and murdered in those particular buildings.</span> <span id="s575">We went back to our apartment which was totally dilapidated.</span> <span id="s576">Three families living in our three room apartment.</span> <span id="s577">Going back to my father's business.</span> <span id="s578">What a sad sight.</span> <span id="s579">Selling some books and postcards.</span> <span id="s580">Everything in totally devastated condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">The whole life in Riga today, it is not the Riga which we once used to know.</span> <span id="s582">Latvia was a was a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s583">Riga was known as the little Paris of the East.</span> <span id="s584">Today, what the system has done to a beautiful country - it's absolutely unbelievable.</span> <span id="s585">The shelves in the stores are completely empty.</span> <span id="s586">Nothing to buy.</span> <span id="s587">And any merchandise arrives, there are instantly blocks and blocks of people waiting to buy it.</span> <span id="s588">But we never are sorry that we went back.</span> <span id="s589">We had to fulfill an emotional need and we did exactly that.</span> <span id="s590">And it was very well worth the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">02:30:21</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Thank you very much.</span>
