A., 1928, Melytopal, Ukraine</span></p> <p><span id="s9">SIBLINGS:</span></p> <p><span id="s10">MATERNAL GRANDPARENTS:</span></p> <p><span id="s11">PATERNAL GRANDPARENTS: JEWISH ORGANIZATIONAL AFFILIATIONS (IF GIVEN): I was born in Odessa in 1958.</span> <span id="s12">My grandparents were doctors.</span> <span id="s13">My mother and father were engineers.</span> <span id="s14">They both finished institute studies in Odessa.</span> <span id="s15">My brother Mikhail, an engineer, is four years older than I. Except for a few years in Tambov, where my parents were assigned after their institute studies, I spent most of my childhood in Odessa.</span> <span id="s16">When my mother's father died and my grandmother was alone, our family moved back to live with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">We observed no Jewish holidays until the last years when my father's mother lived with us.</span> <span id="s18">She told me about her childhood in a small Jewish city and how they celebrated the holidays.</span> <span id="s19">After I got married my mother-in-law who was also from a small Jewish city and a religious family told me about them.</span> <span id="s20">But during my first twenty years I didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">The Internal Passport One reason I knew I was Jewish was because of the Soviet Internal Passport.</span> <span id="s22">If you try to travel anywhere, everybody knows that you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s23">It looks like this present my brother sent me.</span> <span id="s24">It's a joke: the "Odessa Citizen's Passport."</span> <span id="s25">Here line by line, just like in the real passport, is listed your family name, your first name, your father's name, when you were born, and on the fifth line, your nationality.</span> <span id="s26">In my passport it was Evrej, which means Jew.</span> <span id="s27">Other passports might say Ukrainian or Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">I was five when I first realized I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s29">Among children you can hear, "don't play with him, he's a Jew."</span> <span id="s30">It's difficult to appreciate now but sometimes it hurts when a child plays with you and calls you a name you know is bad but you don't know why.</span> <span id="s31">I was young when my mother died, and father worked and traveled a lot, and my brother entered the institute in Moscow.</span> <span id="s32">So I stayed alone at home most of the time and had no opportunity to speak of this.</span> <span id="s33">It may have happened once or twice in my childhood but I just remember it because it hurt.</span> <span id="s34">You knew it was better not to speak of it and it was better if nobody knew you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">As a child, I didn't like my name because it was a very Jewish name.</span> <span id="s36">If I said it, nobody needed to ask my nationality.</span> <span id="s37">It was obvious.</span> <span id="s38">I liked my given name but not my family name because it is Jewish.</span> <span id="s39">I asked my father why he had such a name.</span> <span id="s40">But you can't change your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">It's difficult to say whether I would have married somebody who wasn't Jewish.</span> <span id="s42">As I grew older I understood that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s43">My friends were Jewish and I never considered that I could marry someone who wasn't.</span> <span id="s44">I lived in Odessa, a city with many Jews.</span> <span id="s45">In my class at school there were maybe twelve Jewish boys and girls when we were thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s46">We had a lot of Jewish teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">We knew that it was almost impossible for a Jew to get the gold medal, the highest award in the public schools.</span> <span id="s48">We accepted the Russian attitude but weren't afraid we'd be hurt because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s49">I had some Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian friends.</span> <span id="s50">But most of my friends were Jewish because when there was a difficult situation the Russians would stay apart and not be involved in your problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">This is the way it was and at the end you liked it when you understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s52">It's hard to explain in English.</span> <span id="s53">I know I had a more difficult way and my way was different from all others.</span> <span id="s54">At the end I liked that I had to struggle more than others to succeed.</span> <span id="s55">I liked to be first and I liked that I was able to be first, even though I was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Halfway to Siberia The Russian and American educational systems are different.</span> <span id="s57">In Russia you finish public school after 10th grade.</span> <span id="s58">If you wish to study medicine you attend a medical institute for six years.</span> <span id="s59">You attend public school ten years, then institute, six years.</span> <span id="s60">Then you spend three years on the job --a total of nineteen years.</span> <span id="s61">In Russia we had to pass an exam before we could enter the institute.</span> <span id="s62">They say the institute is like college in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Sometimes public school teachers would just mark in the Jewish student's permanent record, "good" instead of "excellent," even if all your marks had been excellent.</span> <span id="s64">I had all "excellent" marks from the time I was ten, and my father wanted me to get a gold medal because if I was able to get it I could enter medical school with only one exam.</span> <span id="s65">If I passed it with a mark of "excellent" I could enter medical school without any problem.</span> <span id="s66">At the end of the last year of school, the tenth year, I had all "excellent" marks.</span> <span id="s67">Still, my father had to come to talk with the principal because I was not on the list for those qualified to receive the gold medal.</span> <span id="s68">They averaged my score at the end of school and hid the true average.</span> <span id="s69">So I had the top grades but did not receive the gold medal to prove it.</span> <span id="s70">I had to take all the exams.</span> <span id="s71">That was the first problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">The next problem was that to take the exams I had to leave Odessa to go to Saratov, which is like traveling from New York to San Francisco, six hours by plane from my city.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Because I could never enter medical school in Odessa in the first place, I had to go to Saratov.</span> <span id="s74">My father took me there.</span> <span id="s75">Only one Jew was allowed for twenty others in Odessa medical school.</span> <span id="s76">In Saratov it was easier because it was halfway to Siberia from the European part of the country where there is a large Jewish population.</span> <span id="s77">Since Saratov was very deep in Russia, I think less anti-Semitism showed up there, especially fifteen years ago when I entered.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A Pretense Reveals the Truth After the exams, I had scored an average of 20.</span> <span id="s79">The maximum score you can receive is 25.</span> <span id="s80">All who get 20 can enter medical school.</span> <span id="s81">But when they made a list of those who could enter medical school, my name wasn't on it.</span> <span id="s82">Then I sent my brother who was in Saratov to speak for me.</span> <span id="s83">He pretended he was the student and said, "My name is ______ and I passed this exam with 20 but my name is not on the list."</span> <span id="s84">They said, "That can't be because we accept all boys with a score of 19."</span> <span id="s85">My brother came back and told me, "If I were in your place I could enter but you cannot."</span> <span id="s86">In this case they wanted boys more than girls!</span> <span id="s87">But before my father left he talked to the dean of the faculty who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s88">He showed him my diploma from school and that I was excellent and received an award, a "Grammata," a certificate like a gold medal in special subjects.</span> <span id="s89">It showed you had a perfect score in the subject.</span> <span id="s90">I had this "Grammata" for biology, chemistry, literature and math, though I had no gold medal.</span> <span id="s91">So after all this, I went to the dean and I was allowed to enter medical school but I didn't receive either a stipend or my student ID.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">For one year I studied without a stipend and without ID.</span> <span id="s93">And only after that year they agreed to take me into the regular course because I had excellent marks on all my courses for the year.</span> <span id="s94">In the third year I received a higher stipend.</span> <span id="s95">They have these for students who study well.</span> <span id="s96">Students who don't do well don't receive stipends and those whose studies are excellent receive a higher stipend, 25 percent more than others.</span> <span id="s97">After the second year I received only the higher sum.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">So I entered Saratov in a six-year program but my family was in Odessa and my father didn't want me to stay in Saratov.</span> <span id="s99">However, they had a lot of Jewish professors and the level of the school was much higher than in Odessa.</span> <span id="s100">After 1953 or so there were no Jewish professors in Odessa and the medical school was not better for it.</span> <span id="s101">I studied in Saratov and liked it much better than when I went back to Odessa.</span> <span id="s102">I liked the students, the teachers and the professors.</span> <span id="s103">It was just that I was lonely away from home.</span> <span id="s104">That was the only problem.</span> <span id="s105">My brother's wife was originally from Saratov and the first year I stayed with her mother.</span> <span id="s106">And then I moved to a student dormitory.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">There were six or seven of us from Odessa, all Jewish, who had to go elsewhere for medical school.</span> <span id="s108">And we went back together to Odessa for our school vacations.</span> <span id="s109">It would take six or seven hours on a night flight.</span> <span id="s110">We would leave at nine in the evening and get there at five or six in the morning.</span> <span id="s111">We traveled from Saratov to Odessa and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Saratov is a very large city of 600,000 or 700,000.</span> <span id="s113">It had a lot of museums and theaters.</span> <span id="s114">It was on the Volga.</span> <span id="s115">You could travel by ship for two days and visit islands.</span> <span id="s116">Or you could go to a good art museum.</span> <span id="s117">It was twelve hours by train from Moscow.</span> <span id="s118">If I wanted to go from Odessa to Saratov it was 48 hours by train.</span> <span id="s119">A lot of Moscow theater groups visited Saratov theaters.</span> <span id="s120">We were able to see the best performances.</span> <span id="s121">And the tickets were much cheaper than here.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Another Temporary Setback I was 22 when I came back to Odessa.</span> <span id="s123">My father wanted me to come back sooner but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s124">They didn't want to accept me.</span> <span id="s125">It takes two years to transfer.</span> <span id="s126">In Saratov it was easy; I filled out the application and I was told that in Odessa they agreed to take me.</span> <span id="s127">I said goodbye to my friends, left my address for them to write and came home with all my belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">But when the school year began, I was told there was no place for me and I was forced to return to Saratov another year.</span> <span id="s129">So I spent four years in Saratov and two in Odessa.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">After six years in medical school, we had the first year of internship which is like a seventh year of study.</span> <span id="s131">We had a chief of internship and we worked at the hospital in different programs such as infectious disease, pediatrics, and gynecology.</span> <span id="s132">I was in the Odessa City Clinic #7.</span> <span id="s133">I had a good chief for my internship and I liked it.</span> <span id="s134">I worked with kids for two or three months in each different specialty such as hematology, infectious disease, early childhood development, and pediatric internal medicine.</span> <span id="s135">After this I took my exams, received my certificate, and I could practice pediatrics anywhere in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">I Refuse My "Orders" But after you finish medical school you receive an "order" to go to a special place where you must work for three years.</span> <span id="s137">You have to repay your education in this place.</span> <span id="s138">The "order" resembles residency in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">At 24 I had some trouble getting my assignment.</span> <span id="s140">Again I was one of the best students but was not given a choice.</span> <span id="s141">I was assigned to a small village but I didn't want to go there and I wouldn't sign the "order."</span> <span id="s142">In this "order" they include the place where you will do your internship and the place where you will work for three years.</span> <span id="s143">Because I didn't want the assignment, I didn't sign, and so I didn't work for more than half a year.</span> <span id="s144">During this time I struggled with them to get permission to stay in Odessa.</span> <span id="s145">Finally, I ended up in an outpatient department in Odessa.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Did I ever think it was not worth fighting the system?</span> <span id="s147">Maybe it had to do with my character.</span> <span id="s148">Officials haven't liked me all my life because I won't sit back.</span> <span id="s149">I say what I want to say.</span> <span id="s150">Even here in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">An "Old Maid" of Twenty-four When I Marry My future husband and I met through our parents' friends.</span> <span id="s152">We had studied in the same school and lived only one block from each other in Odessa.</span> <span id="s153">Most of our married Jewish friends met each other during school or institute years.</span> <span id="s154">We met at the time I finished medical school before I started my internship.</span> <span id="s155">Some or our friends met as we did but I don't think this was most typical.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Most early marriages are during student years at the institute or university or medical school.</span> <span id="s157">I was 24 when I got married.</span> <span id="s158">The average is from 20 to 23.</span> <span id="s159">It depends on your education or what part of the country you live in.</span> <span id="s160">In the Baltic republic the average age to marry was 25.</span> <span id="s161">In Ukraine, 21 or 22 was the average age.</span> <span id="s162">So I was an old maid!</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Our wedding was in a special place, a kind of city hall with a restaurant.</span> <span id="s164">The food was just what they served there, no Jewish dishes, of course.</span> <span id="s165">Most of the guests were our relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">After we were married my mother-in-law invited us to celebrate Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s167">Three or four times a year she prepared gefilte fish and different dishes from matzoh and even cakes from matzoh meal.</span> <span id="s168">At Pesach we could get matzohs in synagogue and she prepared everything.</span> <span id="s169">It was a little bit different from here, but we observed tradition most on Pesach, because we were married at that time, so every year we had a Pesach table.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Traditional Foods without Tradition When I was growing up after my mother died, it was my job to do the cooking.</span> <span id="s171">I did what I could and knew how to make some Jewish foods like latkes, but it wasn't to observe traditions.</span> <span id="s172">My father's mother taught me how to make gefilte fish and other dishes.</span> <span id="s173">I did it just for fun, not for the rituals.</span> <span id="s174">It didn't have to be shabbos or a holiday when I made chicken soup with mandelen or matzoh balls.</span> <span id="s175">I just knew these foods from childhood and prepared them on any holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Our Family Increases; Our Careers Rise Our son was born when I was in internship.</span> <span id="s177">His father was in Kiev on his "ordinatora."</span> <span id="s178">He was doing his clinical studies and got his Ph.D. there.</span> <span id="s179">He came to pick us up after the baby was delivered.</span> <span id="s180">He stayed a week and then had to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">I don't know why but five years later, when I came home from the delivery after our daughter was born I knew it was impossible to live in this country anymore.</span> <span id="s182">From appearances everything was going up for our family.</span> <span id="s183">I had a good job.</span> <span id="s184">I finished my three year course and started working in a hospital as a neonatologist.</span> <span id="s185">I had a good salary.</span> <span id="s186">My husband finished his Ph.D. and started working in Odessa's largest hospital as a surgeon.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">But he had begun with problems because he was a Jew and wasn't assigned work during regular hours.</span> <span id="s188">He had to have only duties at night or on "somaviation," an ambulance plane service.</span> <span id="s189">Such cities as Odessa, which is a large city, have a lot of hospitals, medical schools and professors.</span> <span id="s190">The level of medicine is high.</span> <span id="s191">But in the small towns in the Odessa region there may be no clinic at all.</span> <span id="s192">If you have a patient with difficulties that the doctor there can't manage and the patient may die, he calls the large city and there's a special plane that takes doctors from the large city for consultation to the patient's home.</span> <span id="s193">If it's too bad he picks up the patient and transports him to the large hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">All doctors in large clinics have duties and they have one or two days a month on call with the ambulance plane service.</span> <span id="s195">The clinic where my husband worked was the largest clinic in the region for doctors who worked only on this service.</span> <span id="s196">But it was hard work and nobody wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s197">He was the one on the staff that did it because he couldn't have gotten into the hospital any other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">It was like residency here.</span> <span id="s199">Thirty-six hours he could be away from home and return at 12 at night or later, because of these duties.</span> <span id="s200">He could come home and two hours later a car might arrive to take him somewhere else.</span> <span id="s201">It was a hard time.</span> <span id="s202">Finally at the end before we left, he was able to start working regular hours from 9 to 6.</span> <span id="s203">He had received his Ph.D. and they agreed to take him on the regular staff of the clinic.</span> <span id="s204">It's prestigious for the clinic to have a doctor with a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s205">He might have been happy to stay, because at the time we were getting ready to leave, things were turning better for him.</span> <span id="s206">He had a good salary and regular hours.</span> <span id="s207">In the future he might have been able to advance because they assigned him where he might have become a department chief.</span> <span id="s208">We lived at the highest level when we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">I was the one who started bothering my husband about coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">"Pamjat" and Open Anti-Semitism But we saw that everything was getting worse around us.</span> <span id="s211">There was Pamjat'.</span> <span id="s212">Because Odessa is a very Jewish city, it has two or three Jewish cemeteries and my mother and grandparents are buried in one of them.</span> <span id="s213">One day we visited and found broken monuments and broken graves.</span> <span id="s214">In Russia when you have money you try to build a monument in memory of the dead.</span> <span id="s215">It can be made of marble with something inscribed in Hebrew or in Russian.</span> <span id="s216">We saw that they just broke some of these monuments.</span> <span id="s217">They're expensive and difficult to put up but they look very beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">How can you feel when you see such a thing?</span> <span id="s219">The whole city was talking about it.</span> <span id="s220">My family's graves were not damaged.</span> <span id="s221">They just damaged the central aisle where the most prominent and most expensive monuments are.</span> <span id="s222">Everybody who comes there sees it.</span> <span id="s223">In Russia there are monuments surrounded by fences.</span> <span id="s224">You just see what's between the aisles and you can walk and there are a lot of trees.</span> <span id="s225">The Jewish monuments can be very large.</span> <span id="s226">A Jewish star can be two meters high in black marble and you can't see beyond the second or third row from where you're standing.</span> <span id="s227">I think they broke what was in the center so that everybody could see it was broken.</span> <span id="s228">Around the same time, a park was built over another Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s229">They just took machines and they leveled everything and put trees there.</span> <span id="s230">How can you feel and what can you say?</span> <span id="s231">It was just a job for some people and they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Like a Return to the Period of the "Doctors' Plot" People couldn't read the true facts about the anti-Semitism behind the Doctors' Plot trial when it happened in 1953.</span> <span id="s233">But people who are still alive remember what went on then, of people being thrown off buses.</span> <span id="s234">And even now since everything has turned around in Russia, my friends and my husband's aunt write in letters, that it's dangerous to travel by train, tram or bus because you hear a lot of anti-Semitic talk and you're afraid that something will repeat again.</span> <span id="s235">I think it's become worse since we left because when we were there it wasn't as open.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">My brother lives in Lipitsk, a small city in the middle of Russia, not far from Saratov.</span> <span id="s237">He doesn't write that he wants to leave.</span> <span id="s238">Most antisemitism is on the border near Poland where there are more Jews-- in the Ukraine, in Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s239">In the middle of Russia, where there are one or two Jews in a city, nobody cares, but where there are many, it's a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Chernobyl: How It Reached Us The Chernobyl nuclear station accident was before May 1.</span> <span id="s241">I remember very well.</span> <span id="s242">We were going to go camping with friends in Riba, which is not far from Odessa, and were packing tents in our cars.</span> <span id="s243">Because the first of May is a labor holiday in Russia, the whole country gets three days vacation.</span> <span id="s244">My mother-in-law came to our home on April 29, the day before we left.</span> <span id="s245">She said, "Something happened in Chernobyl."</span> <span id="s246">She heard it on the radio, the Russian broadcast, just news that something happened, as if something happened in the bakery.</span> <span id="s247">Nobody realized what was actually going on.</span> <span id="s248">So we took the kids and brought food.</span> <span id="s249">We stayed on the banks of the river and we used the water from the river.</span> <span id="s250">We lived all day under the sun, under the sky.</span> <span id="s251">All three days, just days after the accident, when the radiation level was very high.</span> <span id="s252">It would have been better just to stay home.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Kiev is twelve hours from Odessa by train.</span> <span id="s254">It's far but not too far to have an effect, depending on the wind.</span> <span id="s255">They say the winds blew in two directions, to the south and to the north.</span> <span id="s256">In Sweden and all the Baltic republics and a piece of Byelorussia, they received a high level of radiation.</span> <span id="s257">We were in the other direction, the Ukraine, and I don't think that it was very high.</span> <span id="s258">What was bad was that we didn't know about the accident and we stayed out and used water from the river.</span> <span id="s259">Rain and dust go down into this river and we used it to prepare food for the kids-- for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Since then I think that in Russia they've learned about radiation.</span> <span id="s261">That year I was pregnant with Nathalie and I was taking advanced courses.</span> <span id="s262">I spent three months in Kiev and nobody told me it was bad if you're pregnant to go to Kiev, which is 120 kilometers from Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s263">Now everybody knows that they have to take kids out of Kiev three or four months a year for their health.</span> <span id="s264">Now we receive letters from our relatives and friends from Kiev and they write that they didn't know anything and they stayed the whole time there and the kids ate everything like strawberries and whatever they could.</span> <span id="s265">What will happen nobody knows.</span> <span id="s266">Now the newspapers, television and radio are reporting everything.</span> <span id="s267">But you can't change anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">The government didn't educate the people as they should have at all.</span> <span id="s269">All those years that we were in Russia, even we doctors didn't know the danger, even when I was pregnant with my daughter and went to take an advanced course in Kiev.</span> <span id="s270">The only thing that was said was after my course.</span> <span id="s271">When I was five or six months pregnant, the professor who gave me the exam asked me, "How do you feel about being pregnant here?</span> <span id="s272">Are you bothered or not?"</span> <span id="s273">I said, "No, I'm not."</span> <span id="s274">And she seemed to agree.</span> <span id="s275">I don't think she knew any more than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Perhaps Anatoly and I knew more than others because he has a distant relative who works with "A.S.": atomic power stations, in the main office in Kiev.</span> <span id="s277">He got much more information but he knew only levels of radiation, where it was bad or worse such as the river.</span> <span id="s278">But nobody realized how long it would be bad for the population.</span> <span id="s279">They thought that when a year passed, everything would be okay, not that it would be worse from year to year.</span> <span id="s280">I think that only now they know the problems.</span> <span id="s281">The last letter that we received from my friend in Kiev said that the government, through city hall, gave all the women permission to have three months vacation to take the kids under twelve years old away from Kiev.</span> <span id="s282">They can go anywhere if they have relatives or money.</span> <span id="s283">This allows women, while they take time off, to keep their jobs with two months pay so they can take the kids awy.</span> <span id="s284">They can't solve the problem of the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Once we agreed to leave we needed someone to sponsor us.</span> <span id="s286">My mother's cousin left Russia ten or twelve years ago and lives in Chicago.</span> <span id="s287">We wrote to her and she agreed to fill out the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Nathalie was born in September.</span> <span id="s289">In April we got the documents from OVIR and in September we got permission to leave.</span> <span id="s290">It took a year after we decided.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Help from Many When we arrived here we were met by Jewish organizations and we received support from them.</span> <span id="s292">We came December 20, 1988.</span> <span id="s293">The first ten days, we had help finding an apartment and the Jewish Family Service gave us a very good case worker who helped us get Leon into Jewish kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">It was at this time that we talked about having Leon circumcised.</span> <span id="s295">We had come to the Jewish community and he had started to go to Jewish kindergarten.</span> <span id="s296">He was five-and-a-half then but he understood a lot and knew that most of the kids were circumcised and he knew that he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s297">I think we decided all together.</span> <span id="s298">My husband is a surgeon and didn't think that a boy has to be circumcised.</span> <span id="s299">He believes every part of the anatomy has a purpose, even the appendix.</span> <span id="s300">He agreed to the circumcision because there was a medical reason to do it, not just a religious one.</span> <span id="s301">Leon had a constriction but in Russia when he was three months old they refused to operate on it.</span> <span id="s302">They just made a tear in the constriction.</span> <span id="s303">I think it should have been done anyway but in Russia it was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">I Am a Stranger Here Though I'm glad to be here, I miss Russia.</span> <span id="s305">Because everyone speaks English around us and it's not our native language, I don't feel at home here.</span> <span id="s306">I don't like to go out.</span> <span id="s307">It's difficult to explain.</span> <span id="s308">You can't say what you want to say.</span> <span id="s309">You can just speak.</span> <span id="s310">It's not your language.</span> <span id="s311">You can't explain your feelings.</span> <span id="s312">You can't explain what you want.</span> <span id="s313">It's not like home.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">We're Soviet Jews but we were Russian; we were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s315">Because we never practiced religion, we never did anything, we just knew that we're Jews.</span> <span id="s316">But you know it's like a label.</span> <span id="s317">It's not our feeling, We never were an entity like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">"The Most Bright Feeling" It was a great surprise here when our American friends the Shapiros took us as guests at a circumcision in a house that was not very big but full of people.</span> <span id="s319">They were saying, "mazel tov" and "simel tov" like a whole family.</span> <span id="s320">I can't explain it but it was the most bright feeling or bright expression for us, that these people came from the job or somewhere but they felt that it's all in the family.</span> <span id="s321">That it happened for them, that they got a new member.</span> <span id="s322">Here, I like that the Jews are together.</span> <span id="s323">In Russia, you never feel that you are a member of something large.</span> <span id="s324">You have your friends, your narrow circle.</span> <span id="s325">But here the Jews seem like a large family with something in common.</span> <span id="s326">So I think there is a difference between American and Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s327">It's community.</span> <span id="s328">Because in Russia there's no community.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Now the language is easier but a year ago it was a large problem.</span> <span id="s330">When we came to the synagogue and everybody started to smile and talk and ask questions, I couldn't answer because I couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s331">I felt that they wanted to do as much as possible to make us feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s332">We were surprised at so much attention and so much concern.</span> <span id="s333">Before I started studying so hard for the medical exams, I felt I'd go to the synagogue near us.</span> <span id="s334">I don't feel as much like a stranger there as I feel in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">"From Our Own Efforts" I hope that we'll pass our exams and start working and everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s336">I hope that we'll be able to help our children choose what they want, because they will not have this problem with language.</span> <span id="s337">Their native language will be English not Russian, so when they choose to do something, I hope we'll be able to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">And I hope here we'll have independence.</span> <span id="s339">I mean independence in doing as much as we can on our own, to be able to do what we want to do.</span> <span id="s340">I hope that in time we'll be able to do it without any help - not our parents', not the Jewish Federation's, or anyone else's.</span> <span id="s341">And what we'll have will be from our own efforts.</span></p></body></html>
