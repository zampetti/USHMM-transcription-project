<html><body><p><span id="s1">Irene Lewis</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: When and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: I was born on Dec. 7 in Kassel, Germany in 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Did you grow up in Kassel?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Yes, until I was 18.</span> <span id="s6">I went to nursing school in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Till you were 18 you went all through school in Kassel.</span> <span id="s8">Can you tell me a little about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s10">First I went to grade school and then my father wanted me to, I had a professional education so I went to a commercial high school, and there was a lot of anti – Semitism there already.</span> <span id="s11">And he died when I was 15, and for instance they wanted to fail me for my exam because I was sitting shiva.</span> <span id="s12">Well that was straightened out, but it was different to be in that school as a Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: This was the professional school?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: No this was the commercial high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: This was about 1935, because you said you were about 15.</span> <span id="s16">Before Hitler came to power how would you describe your relationship with your non – Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Oh, fine.</span> <span id="s18">We were absolutely all one, highly integrated and I had a very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s19">Everything was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: How did you first notice things beginning to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Oh in school.</span> <span id="s22">We heard about it, we read it, we were aware of it.</span> <span id="s23">For instance my brother looks very (word missing in original transcript) and he was always presented as an example of Aryan ways.</span> <span id="s24">That was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s25">My mother looked very Christian.</span> <span id="s26">She was stopped in the street, why she doesn’t buy?</span> <span id="s27">The Fuehrer and she said she’s Jewish and they said everyone says that.</span> <span id="s28">In my town per se, Kassel, anti – Semitism wasn’t too great compared to other towns in various areas, particularly the north, but later on some crazy thing.</span> <span id="s29">For instance after my father died, we always had a maid, she had to leave because we had a man in the house, who was all of 12.</span> <span id="s30">Knew from nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: This was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: This was my brother.</span> <span id="s33">We couldn’t have a maid anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: This was after 1935, after the Nuremberg Laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No, this was after 1938.</span> <span id="s36">Also in 1938 my brother, when they lined up all the people to go to Dachau, of course we had no men in the house, but they looked for my brother who was working as an apprentice nearby, and my mother called up and told them to hide him.</span> <span id="s37">He was a little boy.</span> <span id="s38">But since our family had no male they looked for some male.</span> <span id="s39">And then the question arose whether we could get a visa to America and that was after ’38.</span> <span id="s40">My uncle was sent away shortly after I believe.</span> <span id="s41">And a friend of my mother immigrated to go to America, and he was taken away, so we took her in.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Let me backtrack just for a minute.</span> <span id="s43">We were talking about when you were in the commercial high school.</span> <span id="s44">What types of things did you notice as a girl of about 13, 14, about, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well the teachers, there were several teachers who were just anti – Semitic.</span> <span id="s46">They promoted Hitler and they pointed out that we were Jews and we should all be done away with, and they made these anti – Semitic remarks that all Jews are crooks and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: For a 13 or 14 year old girl that must be very difficult to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: I don’t, you know I had totally forgotten about that.</span> <span id="s49">I don’t know if it mattered so awfully much, because we lived with it.</span> <span id="s50">It wasn’t an isolated case.</span> <span id="s51">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What happened to the Christian friendships you had up to that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Some withdrew and others stayed.</span> <span id="s54">My father had a business friend who was very loyal to us, you know.</span> <span id="s55">You know frankly I don’t remember that so much anymore, because that was so long ago and I had so much later on, that there’s so much more stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s56">I can’t remember that it affected me all that much, but children don’t take that too hard, but don’t quote me on that because I really don’t know, but I do know one thing, that after ’38 my mother tried desperately for somewhere for us to go out, and I had an uncle who went overnight to Argentina.</span> <span id="s57">She didn’t want to send me there and my grandmother lived with us, and what else.</span> <span id="s58">Then I had a boss who wanted to take me to France.</span> <span id="s59">My mother wasn’t for any of this.</span> <span id="s60">She really wanted us to be together.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Were you ever stopped at all from going to school, from finishing this commercial high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: No.</span> <span id="s63">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And then you said that when you finished you went to Frankfurt, to pursue nursing?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Had you always wanted to be a nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was this a Jewish school in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes it was.</span> <span id="s70">No it was the only Jewish hospital in Frankfurt, and the only reason that my mother gave permission for me to go there was that I have a profession in the event that we emigrate somewheres.</span> <span id="s71">And I was rather persistent on the subject.</span> <span id="s72">It was hard to get in, so many girls wanted to get in.</span> <span id="s73">In fact I had to wait from’38 for about six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: You were in Kassel during Crystal Night?</span> <span id="s75">Or in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s77">In Kassel.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: You mentioned that they were looking for men and your father wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s79">Did they find your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No.</span> <span id="s81">He was hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did anything happen to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No.</span> <span id="s84">My uncle was taken I believe, or was he hiding, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: In the nursing school in Frankfurt did you notice things getting worse as far as...?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yes, but that is later.</span> <span id="s87">First it is fine.</span> <span id="s88">It was pretty good, but later of course they had food rations all through Germany.</span> <span id="s89">Ours were a little stricter.</span> <span id="s90">By the time I went there many girls, every day another girl emigrated.</span> <span id="s91">It was very sad.</span> <span id="s92">And for a little while they had Shabbos?</span> <span id="s93">which I didn’t like, not coming from a Jewish home, I mean an orthodox home, that didn’t appeal to me and under the circumstances already, and me not believing in it, that sort of thing, in fact I didn’t know what milching and fleishing was.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: You say you didn’t come from an orthodox home, how did you feel about, what were your feelings about being Jewish under these circumstances in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Not rebellious at all.</span> <span id="s96">I never thought about it.</span> <span id="s97">In a derogative way we went to shul, same shul we had here in the Hebrew Tabernacle, and I never thought I should be something else as far as I can remember.</span> <span id="s98">At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Was there any discussion, this goes back a little way, before your father passed away, of emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No, due to the fact that my father was a real German, in the German army, and he committed suicide as a result of this persecution, which we were never told, we children.</span> <span id="s101">We were told he had a heart attack, but he shot himself.</span> <span id="s102">I only heard after I got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What type of business was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: He dealt in rawhides.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: He was importing them?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No, from the farmers.</span> <span id="s107">Before the revolution in Russia he went as far as Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Do you know even hearing afterwards how the Nazis affected his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I don’t think it affected his business too much.</span> <span id="s110">I think the ideology of the whole thing, or maybe facing emigration, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s111">As I said it wasn’t talked about, but I think I remember that he was quite depressed, but his brother, his older brother who was the head of the family in many ways, kept saying it will never last, we don’t have to leave, and he too was such a devout German.</span> <span id="s112">They believed in milk and honey.</span> <span id="s113">They had absolutely no foresight, which I can’t even say derogatively.</span> <span id="s114">They had no place to go, they were established, they were not that young, probably not that flexible, and really he was one of those people like many of us when somebody came from Poland, you know, he was a strict army German, it was a religion.</span> <span id="s115">That was how I was brought up.</span> <span id="s116">Like his generation.</span> <span id="s117">I could not believe, like when I came here that being Jewish was not just a religion, but that I learned it the hard way.</span> <span id="s118">I can’t remember too much of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: How did your mother after your father passed away, how did your mother react to the growing, you know the strengthening of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: She had nothing to say because my uncle had that in his mind, you understand.</span> <span id="s121">I still hear him saying that terrible thing and he had us all brainwashed.</span> <span id="s122">Then in ’38 she didn’t listen anymore and they had these children transports going to England and she registered my brother and myself and my grandmother and her were still home.</span> <span id="s123">So my brother could leave, but I was one week, you know they had a set date how old you could be or how young, and I was one week too old.</span> <span id="s124">The deadline was the fifteenth of December and I was born on the 7th.</span> <span id="s125">And she didn’t really push it hard nor did I because I didn’t want her to be left alone.</span> <span id="s126">So the next time I would go, that was our idea.</span> <span id="s127">But then the war started.</span> <span id="s128">My husband went to England under the same auspices, and his sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So then your brother then went to England on a kinder transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: how did you get the information about this kinder transport, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Okay, I was just.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I guess it was the Judegemeinde.</span> <span id="s135">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s136">And then I was still registered for Frankfurt, so I said okay, let me get a profession first, and then I can get out.</span> <span id="s137">And that’s how I got to Frankfurt and she was home with my grandmother and as I remember we had some life insurance, and my mother wasn’t financially too well off, not destitute or anything, and I had relatives in Frankfurt, and I saw her.</span> <span id="s138">And I graduated in ’40, the last class that graduated.</span> <span id="s139">I made it.</span> <span id="s140">In fact I made it in a year and a half just to make it, and in order to get papers I had to work first.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Wait a minute, was this the Jude (word missing in original transcript) haus?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Most people from Frankfurt will tell you about it, it was a very well known hospital.</span> <span id="s143">So was the training school.</span> <span id="s144">You mentioned Dagon – strasse here in the U.S. you did not have to make up courses, whereas the English girls had to make up courses, I did not have to make up one course.</span> <span id="s145">So it was a good hospital, very well known, strictly kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Were you at all restricted in that hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Oh yes, now we start cooking.</span> <span id="s148">Of course later on it was restricted and we had to wear a stern and a Jude on it, and we had curfews and we weren’t allowed to go anyplace, and then it really began.</span> <span id="s149">We were in a compound and again I was young, and we had to work hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did you have to wear the stern, it was only mandated in 1942, no before, I believe it was mandated in ’40.</span> <span id="s151">Yes it must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Do you remember the day that you got it?</span> <span id="s153">The star?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you have to wear it on your uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No, only out of the compound, but therefore with young chutzpah I did not let that stop me.</span> <span id="s157">I had star made that I could take off and I went anyplace I wanted to.</span> <span id="s158">And I always loved swimming, and I didn’t have much time off, but one day I said I’m going swimming.</span> <span id="s159">So I went swimming out in the river and somebody almost drowned and I pulled him in and saved his life.</span> <span id="s160">Everyone wondered where is the girl who saved his life, that was the end, I swam underneath and got out before anybody could see me because in spite of that I would have been arrested.</span> <span id="s161">I had no business being there, and that’s the last time I did something like that.</span> <span id="s162">I was scared.</span> <span id="s163">I would have been arrested.</span> <span id="s164">If you were caught not wearing the stern, in another area where you were not supposed to be, you were going to be arrested.</span> <span id="s165">As I said, being young and foolish, that didn’t stop me.</span> <span id="s166">I always had a bit of the rebel in me as far as that was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Speaking of being a bit of a rebel, when you were confronted by all these restricting things like a curfew and a star, as things got worse, how were you coping with this?</span> <span id="s168">Were you able as a family to make any plans about emigration by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: My mother tried, but she, now you mention Crystal Night, you see how far this was away, I was already in Frankfurt where she said I have already arranged, you go to Stuttgart where there was the consulate and you write sister, and I went to Stuttgart and that was the day of Crystal Night come to think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Were you in Stuttgart for Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I was on the train, some man was sitting next to me and __________________and I was sitting there and I still remember I had a little pin from a foreign country and I didn’t say a word, and I was petrified, how an I going to get home.</span> <span id="s172">But I did get home, and I made it and my mother was petrified, her child was on the train someplace, but with my usual luck I made it.</span> <span id="s173">No ill effects.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Had you registered in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, but it was a number that I would have gotten here just about when I did get here.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Did you realize that?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes, but at least I made some provisions.</span> <span id="s178">I should have registered much earlier than I did.</span> <span id="s179">That’s how they start.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: While you were in the Common House in Frankfurt were you able to treat non – Jewish patients?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">As: No, in fact my license was made out when I finally got to it, that I was not to practice nursing except in a Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s182">In fact I still have it I think in the drawer.</span> <span id="s183">And then after the war, of course a lot happened in between, when I wanted my license again, they gave me the regular license.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: When you were in the Judes (word missing in original transcript) haus?</span> <span id="s185">And treating only the Jewish patients were these mostly older people?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Any age.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Were they covered by (word missing in original transcript) ?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Were the doctors all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Sure, everybody.</span> <span id="s192">Except the night nurses.</span> <span id="s193">They had some Christian nurses.</span> <span id="s194">Some of them left voluntarily and others were really very sad for leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: How long were you able to stay with this hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Till ’42.</span> <span id="s197">I left with the last group.</span> <span id="s198">You see being young, and we were all giggly geese, we made our own good time.</span> <span id="s199">I even had a boy – friend who came from Aufenbach.</span> <span id="s200">He wanted to marry, but I said no, because the transports had already started and I said no.</span> <span id="s201">And he brought me all the rations and all the goodies and everything.</span> <span id="s202">Things got tough then, you couldn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s203">I had money, but I couldn’t spend it.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Were you paid in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Very little, but I didn’t need.</span> <span id="s206">I had money of my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: When you say you couldn’t spend it, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: There was nothing.</span> <span id="s209">I couldn’t go out and I think there were restrictions in purchasing too.</span> <span id="s210">I don’t remember anymore, but I remember then, I graduated in ’40 and my mother came, and I got my license only practicing for Jews, but I didn’t care, I was glad I had it, and a week later she called me and she was deported with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s211">She called me in Frankfurt and she told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: What did she tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: We have to leave and oh yeah I know what she said, one of her girls, her parents came from Steteen and they were deported in ’39 and evidently she was watched when she called me and she said remember the parents of so and so, that’s where I am going.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Did you know where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: I think they were all going to Eastern Europe at one time or another, but then, no they went to France, to (word missing in original transcript) .</span> <span id="s216">Oh I was just paralyzed.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: That was the fall of 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: That was in October ‘1940 and she said goodbye to me and I still remember my aunt lived there with my uncle, and my uncle was a war veteran, in the first World War.</span> <span id="s219">He was an amputee.</span> <span id="s220">And he was told he was safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: This was your father’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: My mother’s brother in law.</span> <span id="s223">That was my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s224">And I still remember getting on the bus to go to my aunt and people around me laughed, and I said how can you laugh, the world has come to an end.</span> <span id="s225">I remember that so well.</span> <span id="s226">To me my world had come to an end and I talked to my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: This was on the way going to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I was in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Going to (word missing in original transcript) ?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: No, no, only Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s231">And I went back home and we all cried and we were so desperate, and I went back to the hospital and drank half a cup of opium.</span> <span id="s232">Eventually I told someone and obviously everything was alright.</span> <span id="s233">Then as a punishment I had to work in an area where I didn’t like to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: As a punishment from?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: For having done this, because they knew this was a childish thing to do, whatever the reason may be, but they were worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did you know at the time when your mother had told you about Contaguer that that meant an internment camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes, and I knew that I couldn’t be with her, that I couldn’t get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: And your grandmother as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s240">She was old, (word missing in original transcript) she didn’t know where she was going.</span> <span id="s241">It was a terrible thing for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Did you see your mother before she left?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: A week before, because she was there for my graduation.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: But I mean after the phone call?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: She was sent away that day.</span> <span id="s246">And then I finally heard via Switzerland, where she was, and as I said I was always a good swimmer and I had made arrangements to swim across the Rhine and make my way to Contaguer.</span> <span id="s247">And everything was arranged and then it fell through, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s248">And I got letters from her via Switzerland and she was alright.</span> <span id="s249">My grandmother had by then died, about half a year later.</span> <span id="s250">And she had written from Contaguer to America and they still wouldn’t take her in.</span> <span id="s251">Relatives who were already overloaded with affidavits and what not.</span> <span id="s252">We had no close relatives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: All this time you were working in the hospital in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: After you graduated you were able to get a job there?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh yeah, in fact you had to promise that after graduation you would work at least two years there.</span> <span id="s257">You had to work.</span> <span id="s258">There was no other choice, but if I had gone before, you had to promise to work two more years.</span> <span id="s259">The girls were released from that promise in the event they could emigrate, of course.</span> <span id="s260">I mean I didn’t want for a job or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: How did things get worse as you were in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well first of all there were the air raids, we were bombed, and food was less and I guess supplies too.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: The Nazis, were you in fear of them?</span> <span id="s264">Did they come into the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: (word missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s266">But then in ’42 they started to transport people from Frankfurt, systematically every two weeks, and we had a lot of disabled, we had a nursing home, and by that time we were the only district hospital and we had everybody there, and they wanted to take everybody, stretcher cases.</span> <span id="s267">They just wanted to (sentence incomplete) so we gave them shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: You were aware at that time of where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s270">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s271">The doctors told us to give them shots and we did.</span> <span id="s272">I was 19 years old or 20 with that responsibility, but we knew we were doing the right thing, and then we had constantly suicides from these people, attempted suicides.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: In the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: No, brought in from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s275">A young girl I remember she took so much seconal, and we had to save her.</span> <span id="s276">The Nazis came in and they wanted every suicide monitored and they wanted to have a report, and the minute they were well, they were on the next transport.</span> <span id="s277">A terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did you have any contact with the Nazis on the outside?</span> <span id="s279">I mean contact in the sense that they would give orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span> <span id="s281">They came at the time of the transports and checked if relatives were hiding there, but I don’t remember any, you know it was part of life, it’s all gone.</span> <span id="s282">It’s the first time I’ve talked about it, since I don’t know when.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: That must have been a very fearful, just from myself listening, that must have been a very fearful atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: A terrible atmosphere, and then one day people brought us pictures from the ghetto, Riga, that were hanging and I said I don’t believe this, we all said we don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s285">There was just no escape.</span> <span id="s286">And then my aunt and uncle who were promised they wouldn’t be transported, oh yeah, there was a fortune teller and the whole Jewish congregation went to him and he predicted that might aunt and uncle, they were never going, oh yeah they had a son in Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Who had emigrated to Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Who had gone to Australia and somehow they botched it and they couldn’t get out, and my uncle was promised immunity because after all he had lost his leg for the fatherland, and he went to that fortune teller and he said yeah, and me too, I went to that fortune teller and he said oh yeah I’ll see my mother, that’s why I didn’t make that swim also, because he said I would see her anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: What made you go to the fortune teller?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Oh everybody did because we were holding onto a straw.</span> <span id="s291">The reason that this man didn’t charge me anything, he wanted cocaine from me.</span> <span id="s292">He was an addict, but I believed him.</span> <span id="s293">I could have gone with my relatives then I could have stayed on the train, but I believed that I would see my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: You could have gone with your relatives where?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: When they were sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s296">As a nurse I was allowed on the train (sentence incomplete).</span> <span id="s297">They were not at all prepared.</span> <span id="s298">Everyone in Frankfurt knew that if it was not this week then in two weeks you’ll be gone, so they prepared themselves.</span> <span id="s299">They packed blankets, they packed suitcases.</span> <span id="s300">Not my relatives.</span> <span id="s301">My family, my elders, they were so naive it was pathetic.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Now this was your mother’s sister and brother in law?</span> <span id="s303">Now they were deported to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Did you have an option?</span> <span id="s306">You said you were allowed on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes, I could have snuck in.</span> <span id="s308">I don’t know how far.</span> <span id="s309">I could have made it.</span> <span id="s310">But I believed that man, a terrible thing, but we all held onto straws.</span> <span id="s311">Later on I found out my mother was dead then already.</span> <span id="s312">I shiver.</span> <span id="s313">If you want to believe it can affect your life terribly.</span> <span id="s314">I mean in retrospect, after all is well, I came out and my relatives came out.</span> <span id="s315">The end result is what counts.</span> <span id="s316">I don’t know what would have happened to me otherwise, but that was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s317">That was one of the most dramatic times.</span> <span id="s318">Before I went away the influx of suicides and the score of killing people for their own benefit.</span> <span id="s319">I don’t know how I could live with it.</span> <span id="s320">I strongly believe this was not wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: The first time you were given the instructions to do this...?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I didn’t sleep all night.</span> <span id="s323">We all did it.</span> <span id="s324">I mean there was nobody who didn’t participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: What cases, I mean was there any priority as far as to give the shots to?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: You go to (word missing in original transcript) Home and you see these vegetables.</span> <span id="s327">That’s the ones.</span> <span id="s328">You know these very old dilapidated people who were incontinent, who weren’t alive really.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What happens if there was a question, I mean some people are just old and there’s a question mark?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: For somebody whose alive...</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: For a 19 year old girl that is a horrible responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Horrible, for anybody.</span> <span id="s333">In fact I would go further.</span> <span id="s334">I think I would hate it more there now than I did then.</span> <span id="s335">You see in these years, I, That’s a psychological observation your upbringing had a great deal to do with it.</span> <span id="s336">We were spoiled, but we were loved, and we were not overly indulged.</span> <span id="s337">We were taught right from wrong, but then after this comes onto you your animal instinct takes over.</span> <span id="s338">Your survival instinct and everything and I will tell you at a later time (word missing in original transcript) will take precedent over everything else and I can truthfully say when all is said and done young as I was, I have never, never done anything I was sorry for.</span> <span id="s339">I had many opportunities to do something that would have harmed my co – prisoners, not once, nothing I ever did, and that’s what I can live with.</span> <span id="s340">That other thing we did in Frankfurt we did as a mitzvah.</span> <span id="s341">Believe me, believe me, it was a mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Were the people in Frankfurt, was there ever a choice given between Thereseienstadt and staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No.</span> <span id="s344">The only reason we were protected, the nurses, was because we still took care of the hospital, and Sept. 22, that’s the last one, we left then, and the next day the whole hospital was bombed.</span> <span id="s345">England knew all about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: So it was Sept. 22?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Sept. 22, 1942 that I was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: To where were you deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Well we first went to, you know there was only cattle trains, and then we went to Berlin, and then we went to Riga, and they were overcrowded there.</span> <span id="s350">And then we went up to Telen which was Estonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: When they announced the closing of the (word missing in original transcript) haus, the deportation, were you at that point, what were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: My thoughts were thank God.</span> <span id="s353">You know that, because I knew what was ahead of me, and I didn’t know what was ahead of me, I simply couldn’t fathom, but we all felt at this moment, thank God.</span> <span id="s354">We couldn’t go nowhere.</span> <span id="s355">Germany at this moment was closed, my family was gone, my brother was in England.</span> <span id="s356">I just felt okay.</span> <span id="s357">The uncertainty was worse than not knowing what was really.</span> <span id="s358">.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Were you able to take anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s361">I was very heavy.</span> <span id="s362">I was so fat.</span> <span id="s363">This was all arranged, we all put on layers of clothes and put a few things in bags.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What was the rationale?</span> <span id="s365">to putting on layers of clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: So they couldn’t take it from us.</span> <span id="s367">You know a suitcase you could lose, but at least you had some change, and valuables we sewed up in the hem of our clothes, and money, that we put in our star.</span> <span id="s368">Everything had to have a star, so that we put valuables in.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Where did you think you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: They didn’t tell you anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No.</span> <span id="s373">Riga.</span> <span id="s374">And we were lucky because they needed some people in Estonia to rebuild the city, otherwise we would have been slaughtered right there I suppose.</span> <span id="s375">Because it was full.</span> <span id="s376">Full of Jews.</span> <span id="s377">They didn’t know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: When you got to these cattle cars, into these trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Oh terrible.</span> <span id="s380">Awful.</span> <span id="s381">You know we had food rations, and then imagine a whole bunch of stinking people, no washing, there was a water shortage.</span> <span id="s382">And then as we ate up the food, we used the can in which to urinate and then we threw it out of the train.</span> <span id="s383">It was a very complicated situation and the screaming going on and we had to go.</span> <span id="s384">I don’t even like to relate it.</span> <span id="s385">It was animalistic and difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: In that transport were you all from Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes, and then we were, and some came from Berlin.</span> <span id="s388">I don’t remember how many there were.</span> <span id="s389">It took a week.</span> <span id="s390">A whole week, and it was getting colder and colder.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: During that whole week were you ever out of that car?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s393">For a little while, but we were closely guarded, with machine guns all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: How were you able to sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Straw mats, but there was no room and the stink.</span> <span id="s396">I don’t know anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And so you went to Riga.</span> <span id="s398">When you got to Riga did you find out right away that there was no room?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I don’t know anymore.</span> <span id="s400">We heard later on.</span> <span id="s401">They needed people up in Estonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: So you didn’t stay in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No.</span> <span id="s404">And cold.</span> <span id="s405">And then we were let out in Estonia.</span> <span id="s406">No.</span> <span id="s407">There was an expression called Scloissencamp, you were taken there and everything was taken away from you except what you had on your body, and then after you showered you could get things back, I don’t know anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: This was in Telen?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s410">It was in the country someplace.</span> <span id="s411">And it was winter and then they made us shovel snow, from one side to another, just so we could do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Who was in charge of this?</span> <span id="s413">The S.S.?</span> <span id="s414">They had come with you all the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: I mean they were German S.S. rather than...?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s418">All the way up.</span> <span id="s419">They were in Estonia.</span> <span id="s420">And in order to wash we melted a big pot of snow and that was divided among all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: You were living in barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s423">On straw mats.</span> <span id="s424">And then we learned that when you come in you take your coat off and cover yourself, and that is warmer than when you keep your coat on.</span> <span id="s425">You are much warmer when you cover yourself with something than to wear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You were still allowed to keep the clothes that you had on?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: The ones that we had on, yes.</span> <span id="s428">And your period became such a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: There was no...?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Well we took along.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: But that was used up.</span> <span id="s432">Eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s434">Eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: The only thing I can think of is rags.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes of course.</span> <span id="s437">And later on they supplied us with these fisherboots and in order to keep from freezing we used rags around our feet which I found was very warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Who supplied you with these fisherboots?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: The S.S.</span> <span id="s440">They needed us for some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: What work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Shoveling snow.</span> <span id="s443">Altogether, I’ll go into more details, for a year and a half I was in Telen in the prison for political prisoners, and from there, we stayed there a year and a half, and a German construction firm from Frankfurt employed us to do some labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: What kind of labor were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s446">With the exception of this I was altogether in eleven different camps.</span> <span id="s447">We were always transported, never knowing, and in Telen we lived in a cell with cots and one toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: How many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Ten, it was very funny, most of us were young, and some of us were Sedeutsch and some of us were Nordeutsch and there was a vast difference in mentality like here the southerner and the northerner.</span> <span id="s450">Very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: When you say they were Nordeutsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Other people.</span> <span id="s453">We were all Jews.</span> <span id="s454">But there were two people and they were in my barracks and they didn’t know they were Jews and they suffered even more than we did, because they figured why me.</span> <span id="s455">We knew why, you know?</span> <span id="s456">And there was one woman and she was from Berlin and she was really a very lovely person and she gave us such a business as young girls, you know.</span> <span id="s457">Here we are stuffed like sardines and she gave us such a business when we pushed, you should say excuse me you pushed, everybody pushed, and you go to the bathroom too long or you used the sink too long, and this perpetual checking in.</span> <span id="s458">You know the prison guards were women, and they were worse than men and they checked us in and out and I’ll tell you later.</span> <span id="s459">We did brick laying for this construction firm and we had German civilians as foremen, and they knew, some of them were nice I must say, and they knew that in order to get any work out of us they have to teach us how, beating alone doesn’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Were you in fact beaten, not you yourself, but?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yes I was.</span> <span id="s462">There was once, I don’t know if it was there, but in Estonia, it was so cold there.</span> <span id="s463">You see today they have these big barrels with a fire, that’s where we could warm ourselves up and one day one of those S.S. guys took a coal and poked me in the eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: A hot coal?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: A hot coal.</span> <span id="s466">One of my lids I have a real hole.</span> <span id="s467">And once we were with this construction firm, first the man came, he was a civilian, not an S.S. man and his name was Mr. Hamlish and I will tell you the story because it’s very interesting for you later on.</span> <span id="s468">He greeted us by saying you girls are hired by my firm and anybody who escapes I’ll shoot the whole lot of you and that prevented all of us from escaping.</span> <span id="s469">You see they were smart, we had a chance to escape.</span> <span id="s470">They didn’t give us numbers, they only shaved our hair, because of lice I suppose and this way we really could be identified and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s471">I didn’t have a number and I’m glad.</span> <span id="s472">I guess it was too far away with Russia there and I guess they didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s473">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s474">I never asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: When they shaved your hair, I once heard somebody say that when you get the medication for radiation therapy, for cancer patients, very often you lose your hair, and it’s very traumatic for people, so for a nineteen year old girl...</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: We were all in the same boat.</span> <span id="s477">And we had some Czech girls who were extremely talented in sewing and everything and we all made up new turbans and we got along.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: When you say you made up new turbans, what did you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: We had some scarves or something.</span> <span id="s480">You see we kept some things that were most necessary back.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: You mentioned that there were some opportunities to escape, even though the fear...</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Of course we wore labels and the Estonian people were very sympathetic towards us.</span> <span id="s483">I had a man bring me food every day, two big sandwiches, hiding in the (word missing in original transcript) pile of dirt, and toothpaste.</span> <span id="s484">I shared it with my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: How did you meet this man, how did you know...?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: We couldn’t speak to each other, it was the most interesting thing.</span> <span id="s487">The girls all laughed at me because many had a little friend like that but mine, we couldn’t talk to each other, but he had my food there every day, and he once had somebody write in German, if I want to escape, he will help me, but first of all I couldn’t leave if my friends were going to be shot and secondly, where was I going to go.</span> <span id="s488">There was Russia next door, and I knew enough about Russia then that that was no picnic.</span> <span id="s489">I said what am I going to do in Estonia.</span> <span id="s490">I don’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s491">I can’t, where am I going to go, it’s all Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: How did you meet these...?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: They saw us building and they knew what was behind it and they felt sorry for us, and every few girls they had these sugar daddies and they brought us the necessities.</span> <span id="s494">For instance later on...</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: The S.S. didn’t...?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: They didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s497">As we got picked up to go, you learned they just brought the fresh bread on the wheel wagon.</span> <span id="s498">Oh it smelled so good, and we were obsessed by the idea of how we would get that fresh bread.</span> <span id="s499">Stealing became a fun game.</span> <span id="s500">You know a way of survival, and wherever we were we found out a way of stealing.</span> <span id="s501">Once we were stealing sauerkraut and I was elected to get to the bottom of the barrel and whoever was supposed to hold me didn’t hold me tight enough and I fell in the sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s502">Oh did I stink.</span> <span id="s503">And once we fell in the herring tub.</span> <span id="s504">I mean stealing became a fun game.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: How did you arrange the stealing so you wouldn’t be?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: We were on the outside and the builders away, and then I found out later on that in prison itself the hardened prisoners, just like here, they were the king of the prison.</span> <span id="s507">That was in another camper later on, not in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: What was the name of this one near Telen?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Oh okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: And we were only there because this company needed our labor, and then after that we were sent someplace else and we had to do bricklaying, not bricklaying, railroad building.</span> <span id="s512">Now imagine girls lifting that.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How were you able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: The foreman was smart, they weren’t consumed by hate.</span> <span id="s515">They taught us how to work.</span> <span id="s516">They were excellent in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: The foremen were German civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes, and they were good at it, and they felt sorry for us of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: When you say they felt sorry for you, how did you feel that, how did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: They were nice to us, they didn’t whip us.</span> <span id="s521">They didn’t whip us any time, they were nice, and they thought of their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did they ever try and make the work load easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s524">But it still had to be done, and the S.S. was around someplace.</span> <span id="s525">It had to be done tactfully, and I remember once, one of the foremen, I was so hungry and he brought me his left over dinner, and I almost vomited by the thought of it, but I ate it.</span> <span id="s526">I remember that that bothered me terribly to be so low to eat from somebody else’s leftovers.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: What was the daily food?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: We got some.</span> <span id="s529">I guess it was lard and a little bit of bread and once a day soup.</span> <span id="s530">Once we worked we got two soups a day.</span> <span id="s531">One was supplied by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You mean by the company?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s534">Chicken soup, and on Christmas they gave us some sturdier mush.</span> <span id="s535">And I don’t remember where it was we stole potatoes from a field and we made a grate and we made (word missing in original transcript) in the fire.</span> <span id="s536">We burned potatoes in the fire.</span> <span id="s537">That was vegetables, whatever we could find.</span> <span id="s538">I don’t know how it came, but we stole.</span> <span id="s539">We couldn’t exist on what we got, really not.</span> <span id="s540">We got horse meat which didn’t matter, but we never got rotten food I must say, at least I never saw it.</span> <span id="s541">In fact we had far from a well balanced diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: You mentioned before that you were heavy.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Enormous.</span> <span id="s544">I was not then anymore, but when I came here I was 180 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: No I meant when you left Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I was always fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And during this time that you were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I got thinner.</span> <span id="s549">Of course fat girls they beat us up too much, you’re too fat.</span> <span id="s550">I got a knock on my head once, you know you couldn’t get on those trains fast enough or a bus or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: In Telen you were bricklaying, why did this assignment end?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I don’t know anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: In other words one day you were just told you have to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Where did they send you from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Somewhere in Estonia, in the woods someplace.</span> <span id="s557">No the railroads were later on, oh I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Was this group always together?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s560">It was such mindless kind of work, for instance they knew I was a nurse, but I was too young, so for a short while I worked as a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: In the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No in the camp.</span> <span id="s563">In the infirmary.</span> <span id="s564">And then this constant fear of what’s a shower and what’s gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Did you know that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s567">When we got there and checked in there was something like that done.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: When you checked into this prison in Telen?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s570">I don’t know where I was anymore.</span> <span id="s571">Once I was sick and I checked into this infirmary and they came around for collection, you know, and I hid.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: What do you mean by collection?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: To pick them out and put them away.</span> <span id="s574">Whoever couldn’t work was useless.</span> <span id="s575">And I hid in the latrine for twelve hours, in the shit, and you know I am so squeamish I can’t smell anything and I couldn’t feel nothing.</span> <span id="s576">Just to stay alive.</span> <span id="s577">That’s where your animal instinct.</span> <span id="s578">And once again I jumped out of a window.</span> <span id="s579">I don’t know where it was, from the second floor and I didn’t even hurt myself, and I escaped then.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: When this time was that you hid in the latrine, was this in Telen yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: No, in Estonia someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: When they came to see if someone was useless, were there gas chambers there or did they deport them?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: They took them somewhere else, the collection agent or they shot them, I don’t know anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: How were you able to stay hidden for twelve hours?</span> <span id="s585">How big a group were you?</span> <span id="s586">What I’m really asking is, could they pinpoint that you were missing?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: No, no they didn’t count, they just looked around.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: How did you know when to come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: My friends told me, but there was one very bad thing, like everywhere else there’s a bad apple.</span> <span id="s590">Of course the Nazis liked some of the young girls and they wanted to become friends and they promised them the sky and I never did and they didn’t force them.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Weren’t you afraid not to?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s593">They could have, you know if not me somebody else, and these stupid girls, they had it better for a little while, but they also were spying on us, and ultimately they (sentence incomplete) certain death, for sure certain death.</span> <span id="s594">That’s where my remark came in that I did nothing to be ashamed of.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: When you said certain death why, you would think that this would help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No it didn’t.</span> <span id="s597">I don’t know anymore where it was so prevalent, several of them, particularly the Hungarian girls were very dangerous.</span> <span id="s598">I must truthfully say, and some of the girls had to be watched and some of the Czech, the German girls were more...</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Were you afraid, I’ll call it of a fifth column in your midst, of spies?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: How did you deal with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Well we just watched out for instance once, and then the stealing that went on, and you couldn’t leave, the little you had was stolen from you, bread or anything, and I remember my only winter coat one day was missing.</span> <span id="s603">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s604">And I had a girl in mind, in Estonia garlic grows in the fields and she ate garlic like apples.</span> <span id="s605">Many of the girls did, you know, it’s a good vitamin source if you can eat it and she stank of garlic something fierce and it exudes through the skin.</span> <span id="s606">You know all those people who eat garlic, you can smell it through their clothes, and I knew and I said okay, I don’t want to know who took it, but I want it back.</span> <span id="s607">You could report that to the guards and you got another one, I said I don’t want to have to ask for another one, and my coat was back, and my coat smelled from garlic and my assumption was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: When you say you could ask the guards for another one, was that possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Well they had plenty.</span> <span id="s610">They had a whole slew of things from...</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: But did they give them?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yes they did.</span> <span id="s613">Somehow they had a way of, they couldn’t strip us.</span> <span id="s614">We had to have some sort of bare necessities.</span> <span id="s615">But of course the things that happened, while we were working with the construction we had to insulate (word missing in original transcript), and they gave you something like I would call it today fiberglass,and one of our stupid girls said I have an idea, it’s cotton wool and she used it for her period.</span> <span id="s616">It’s non – absorbable in the first place and all the glass, she was very sick, she almost died.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Sure she must have gotten glass through her skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: What a mess.</span> <span id="s619">I cut myself and they had no gauze bandages.</span> <span id="s620">I was excused from labor.</span> <span id="s621">What was I to do instead with an infected hand?</span> <span id="s622">Clean the latrine.</span> <span id="s623">Well God was with me all the way.</span> <span id="s624">All the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: when you had to clean the latrine were you given any chemicals?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Lye.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Were you also given gloves?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Brushes, you know like floor brushes.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Were you able to keep the latrines clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s631">They were pretty clean.</span> <span id="s632">First you have to learn the trick to go in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: What do you mean the trick to go in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: It’s a hole.</span> <span id="s635">It’s like a crate with a hole.</span> <span id="s636">If you were not careful you could slip in.</span> <span id="s637">They were kept pretty clean.</span> <span id="s638">They assigned people you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: When you said before that you hid in one of those latrines, those holes were they emptied?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Once in a while, yes.</span> <span id="s641">I took one of the half empty spots.</span> <span id="s642">And oh many things happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Do you remember the progression of where you went from Telen from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: No there were so many and then the Russians came in and we were put on this boat from Telen to what is it called, oh yes, Danzig, and in between I once was assigned to deep sea dive because they wanted to build something that put.....(sentence incomplete).</span> <span id="s645">They were joined, they didn’t join us we were joined by them.</span> <span id="s646">There was a tremendous difference between us.</span> <span id="s647">They hated us because we were Germans.</span> <span id="s648">They really didn’t trust us and we had to pay for what our fathers did.</span> <span id="s649">They treated us like they were treated, but they had one great thing, they had a greater ability to survive and they had more experience because for us it was the first time with our people.</span> <span id="s650">The men fell over like flies.</span> <span id="s651">The women were much stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: when you say the men, were you together with the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s654">Not in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: No, I mean in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yes, when we were shipped they died in front of our eyes.</span> <span id="s657">It was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: You mentioned, can you approximate the size of your group?</span> <span id="s659">I mean like would it be a thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Oh no. 500.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: How did you make yourself understood with the other nationalities, the Czechs...?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well they all spoke Yiddish and eventually we all spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s663">The Czechs speak beautiful German, no problem, and the Vilna, it was very funny, even (word missing in original transcript) sometimes mentions there was a tremendous friction between Vilna and what’s the other one (word missing in original transcript), and they hate each other.</span> <span id="s664">So everybody hated each other, but they all had the same goal, but we did learn a lot from the Polish people because they had more experience and they were more adept and they are more mechanical.</span> <span id="s665">We made a good team once we overcame the fear of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: How did you overcome that?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: We were all in the same boat and they finally realized that we were treated as miserably as they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So you are saying that it was essentially in the beginning.</span> <span id="s669">How did those differences make themselves...?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Oh they ((word missing in original transcript) us.</span> <span id="s671">They really gave us the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: You mean how do you know you are not one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No.</span> <span id="s674">Our fathers were not treated right by you now we do not treat you right.</span> <span id="s675">They knew the ropes better than we did.</span> <span id="s676">.</span> <span id="s677">Ultimately we learned Yiddish and we got along.</span> <span id="s678">I had a boyfriend in Pugno?</span> <span id="s679">Someplace.</span> <span id="s680">Oh he sang so beautifully.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Were you able to mix with the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yes, but I was so naive, that I didn’t do any more than mixing, you know, I was very naive.</span> <span id="s683">I never did anything then because everybody was afraid of getting pregnant.</span> <span id="s684">One girl was pregnant and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: One girl was pregnant?</span> <span id="s686">Was she able to get an abortion?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: She had the baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No.</span> <span id="s690">When you were pregnant that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: You mean they shipped you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: You know it was beautiful to be naive and another thing, but you don’t have it in this.</span> <span id="s693">The married women who were separated from their husbands, they went wild.</span> <span id="s694">Us naive kids didn’t even know why they went so wild, and I kept it all through the time, and I had many friends, real good friends never took advantage of me.</span> <span id="s695">You see in these times what you couldn’t get you didn’t ask for because you get it elsewhere.</span> <span id="s696">I was immensely naive.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: When you way you were able to mix you mean you were able to get together in terms of...?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Recreation.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: What types of recreation?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: We sang together, bull sessions.</span> <span id="s701">I don’t remember anymore, but we were together, we ate together, they stole food for us, we stole food for them.</span> <span id="s702">That was a game.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Was that under guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: In a way.</span> <span id="s705">I don’t know anymore, don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s706">But we did have times together, not, of course there was hanky – panky going on, but as I said thank God I was naive.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Just in terms of hanky – panky, how did people find places?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Where there’s a will there’s a way.</span> <span id="s709">And as I said there are ways and means I’m sure, and under the most stringent of circumstances, hanky – panky goes on.</span> <span id="s710">As I was telling you later on when we were shipped to Danzig then we didn’t know if we would get there in the first place.</span> <span id="s711">The fear, and I was seasick and I decided that I would stay on the deck and really it was a nice ride.</span> <span id="s712">I didn’t get sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: You went from Telen to Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: And the sea was fine and I didn’t get seasick.</span> <span id="s715">Oh yes and I told you that I went deep sea diving in a machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Who taught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I was elected.</span> <span id="s718">I could swim, I was elected, you do this, you go down.</span> <span id="s719">I did.</span> <span id="s720">I hoped my friends would pump properly and I came up.</span> <span id="s721">And once we were swimming.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Why did you do this deep sea diving?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: I know, but for what purpose?</span> <span id="s725">They wanted to ram in some long poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s727">They wanted to build something.</span> <span id="s728">Very often they had no work for us and they made work and in the process we saw a German ship outside the harbor, not near us, and then the S.S said you can go out to see them and we were hungry, and would you like to have some food, oh yes, and they threw it in the sea right in front of our eyes, the whole, like seafood, right in front of our eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: This was in Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: No this was before.</span> <span id="s731">That’s why the S.S permitted us to go out, because they knew and very often the army and the navy were for us and they very often sent us food.</span> <span id="s732">We were observed but there were ways and means where we could get food.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: When you say the army or the navy you mean the old military establishment from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes, there was a friction between them and very often that was our source of income food wise and that’s all that mattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: How did they get it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I don’t know anymore, but they put it someplace, it was a hanky – panky.</span> <span id="s737">We weren’t observed that strict like you see in a prison because there was no need to, where were we going to go.</span> <span id="s738">They know we wouldn’t go anyplace and we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s739">Psychologically they observed us in the first place and we were a closely knit group and they observed us to some extent, but there was plenty of freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: How long were you around Estonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: ’42 till ’44.</span> <span id="s742">Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Did you know when you were shipped to Danzig that the war was going badly for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s745">We heard the shooting in St. Petersburg.</span> <span id="s746">Oh we heard the shooting, we knew it, and then in Danzig we were greeted and everything was taken from us and we had (sentence incomplete).</span> <span id="s747">You know the stripes.</span> <span id="s748">That’s what we had then.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Where did you go in Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: There was a camp Stuttle.</span> <span id="s751">And again that was a prisoner camp, and that’s where I learned that hardened criminals, they had the run of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: How do you mean that?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Like here in America the hardened criminals, they rule the prisons.</span> <span id="s754">They get champagne, caviar and everything.</span> <span id="s755">These people they probably had champagne, and caviar too, and liquor, but they had food, they had toothpaste, they had luxuries.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Who were the hardened...?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: They were murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: You mean the S.S. who were in charge of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: The S.S. was in charge, but the real criminals were felons, I mean murderers, killers, whatever.</span> <span id="s760">They treated us with tender loving care.</span> <span id="s761">That’s where we really got what we needed.</span> <span id="s762">But the Nazis couldn’t do a thing with them.</span> <span id="s763">They ran the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: How was it that you were able to get such good care?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: You saw the gates, the men were standing here the women there and the discussion came up what do you need and they felt sorry for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Now who were these, they were German criminals?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: It was Danzig, they were German criminals, but they didn’t like what they saw, but we got toothpaste and a little more food.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: What was your work in Stuttle?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Railroad building.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q” Outside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Oh yes, and some other work very often, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: What were the conditions in Stuttle like?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: (sentence missing).</span> <span id="s774">That’s where I once jumped out to escape.</span> <span id="s775">That’s where we showered when we came in.</span> <span id="s776">Every month we had a shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Who determined who goes to the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: I really don’t know, it was just a matter of luck and at that time our group from Estonia was divided and there were only two of my former friends and myself in this particular block, the others went (word missing in original transcript) We were all separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: When you came to Stuttle or when you came to Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: This was all the same thing.</span> <span id="s781">We were all divided and many of them, one girl I knew well she died of pleurisy and some were put away.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: In Stuthof what were the actual camp conditions, were you in barracks?</span> <span id="s783">Were you able to keep yourselves clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Oh yes you would be amazed.</span> <span id="s785">First of all some place in Estonia we were working with Russians and we got lice, body lice and we got scabies and oh it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s786">In the ice cold barracks we couldn’t stand the itch and the body lice in the seams of your clothes, and so we ((word missing in original transcript) all night we (word missing in original transcript) and head lice too.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: It also carries typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Body lice, not head lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Was there typhus in Stuthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Afterwards, I’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s791">You see for their own protection, sanitary, I think it was in Stuthof they give us shots.</span> <span id="s792">They experiment with fertility, in birth control pill then.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I had no idea, but my period stopped which was very good for my cleanliness, not for my physical health, but I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s795">It’s amazing you don’t care.</span> <span id="s796">You don’t care for nothing.</span> <span id="s797">You care where your next food comes from and how you stay alive, and you talk about your family and your last (word missing in original transcript).</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: When you say you talk about your family did you know at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s800">You talk about how you were brought up, and you know.</span> <span id="s801">Nothing I knew.</span> <span id="s802">I knew that my brother was in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: When you came to Stuthof did you know what was going on in Auschwitz and other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s805">Before that.</span> <span id="s806">We were always on guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: How did you get the information?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: It was constant, and some of the Nazis as I said they did not want to go to bed with us but they were sympathetic to us.</span> <span id="s809">The women were bad, the women were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: When you say they were sympathetic, was there ever a conversation about how did things get so bad, and isn’t there anything they could do about it or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s812">They were under orders.</span> <span id="s813">It’s hard to explain and I don’t remember all the details, but as I said at Eleanor’s there are several girls here and we were all liberated from various areas but we originally started out together, and I could not associate with them, I just couldn’t because I didn’t want to talk about it any more.</span> <span id="s814">Also when we got back to normal life in Frankfurt,( sentence incomplete) I was and I just didn’t want any, there’s one girl here in the neighborhood who I sometimes talk to, but other than that...</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: You were liberated from Stuthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: In Stuthof things got bad for the Germans and we were put on what is commonly known as the death march and that was rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Where did you have to march?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: West.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Further into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s821">And that was rough.</span> <span id="s822">March, drink from the gutter, eat garbage, I mean that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: When you were told that you had to leave Stuthof did you realize that it was because the Russians were closing in?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yes, but then we were all put in a terrible place like a barn, typhus like you mentioned, everything was there.</span> <span id="s825">Dead and alive were next to each other, and the death march was about four or five days I don’t remember, but it was rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Food?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No food, nothing, no water, cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: This was in the winter 194...?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: No it was March and it was near (illegible) East Germany and it was just, you just existed.</span> <span id="s830">It was (word missing in original transcript).</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Did you have shoes to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yes, but they had holes and they were wet and dirty and you were hungry.</span> <span id="s833">I don’t know anymore.</span> <span id="s834">And I’d just as soon not know.</span> <span id="s835">And then we were put in this horrible place.</span> <span id="s836">Dead and alive together, the doors were locked, the guards were outside, and one morning we got up and there were no guards and that was it, the Russians were there and that was it.</span> <span id="s837">On March 10, 1945, that was it, and then, we didn’t know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: How did you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: We didn’t know what to do by ourselves.</span> <span id="s840">Our lives had been dictated all these years.</span> <span id="s841">We were still afraid.</span> <span id="s842">And I’ll never forget one of the Russian soldiers found some Nazis and he gave me a gun and said here, you can shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: You couldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: No I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s845">Not only didn’t I know how to operate a gun, I couldn’t do it, and then I met this Russian officer who was a nice man, a gentleman, and he said look I’d like to take you to Russia, we need nurses, but I know you wouldn’t be happy, but watch out for the other Russian soldiers, they’ll all rape you, they’ll consider you as German, and they are animals, and how right he was.</span> <span id="s846">I was raped over and over again and then I got sick.</span> <span id="s847">My friend and I, the only one I had left, we finally came to Warsaw, and again (word missing in original transcript) and what not.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: I just have to interrupt for a minute.</span> <span id="s849">It just occurs to me that after you had gone through all of that under the Germans, to be liberated by the Russians like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I didn’t know who I hated more I’ll tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s851">Oh yes and then the first orgy we had was eating.</span> <span id="s852">We found this gentleman’s farm and we ate ourselves sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: This was outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: This was outside, and then I got typhus and then I really was sick.</span> <span id="s855">It came from all ends.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: When you say you ate yourself sick...?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: When you are starved and you start eating normally with all the fat and all the meat that’s the end of you and we were told...</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Well we were warned, but who could stop us, and that’s when I really got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: How did you find the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: There was a farm that was left and I was elected to cut the chicken, the Jewish housewives they cooked the chicken, I never cooked a chicken in my life, and we ate and they found a goose liver, and it was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s862">If we had sense, and that’s really a breeding ground for getting sick, if not for dysentery, everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Did the Russian give you any advice at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: No, they were starved themselves.</span> <span id="s865">At this point they were starved almost as much as we were, and that’s when I had my first hard liquor.</span> <span id="s866">They made vodka in the fields and they drank and they got so sad, the vodka really drips out of their eyes, disgusting and speaking of fire water, and this of course protects you, this vodka from the fat.</span> <span id="s867">In fact they say before you drink you should eat fat so your stomach can take it, but one time vodka, that’s all I ever needed, I never drank it again.</span> <span id="s868">I don’t know anymore.</span> <span id="s869">Ultimately we ended up in (word missing in original transcript) and I ended up in a hospital unconscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: You had typhus as you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yes, and for days I was unconscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: You were with these two other girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes, and in the meantime they got better and they left me.</span> <span id="s874">They left me all alone.</span> <span id="s875">So when I got better, I was in a hospital for venereal disease, and every day they checked me for syphilis.</span> <span id="s876">These girls had syphilis, but if I didn’t have it I would get it there.</span> <span id="s877">From all that raping I got nothing, no pregnancy, no syphilis, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: You mentioned that you lost your period, did that have anything to do with...?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: No I got it back, but I had nothing, nothing, a miracle.</span> <span id="s880">And then I went to the Jewish congregation, oh no that was before I got sick, and they, you had no papers just a number, and we vouched for each other.</span> <span id="s881">And that paper had (word missing in original transcript) but they neglected to put Frankfurt on mine, and everything was Russian by now and here I was with my paper.</span> <span id="s882">I wanted Frankfurt on mine because I knew that my relatives would come back if they came back, my brother would look for me.</span> <span id="s883">I could have also gone to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: You are talking about the Judeshagemeinde now in Poland, Lu ?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: And after I got out of the hospital these (word missing in original transcript) felt sorry for me, where am I going to go so she said come home with me.</span> <span id="s886">And even then I didn’t know what (word missing in original transcript) was and of course it was a (word missing in original transcript) and she knew me, and she had to make a living and in the middle of the night I walked out of there and spent the night in a room and then I marched myself to the Jewish congregation,</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: These were professional (word missing in original transcript)?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yes, and there were a lot of (word missing in original transcript) in Poland because even the nuns did not take care of me and they refused to speak German to me and I was so sick.</span> <span id="s889">Even when I woke up and I was unconscious, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Where did you come across nuns?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: In that hospital, it was all Catholic, and when the bell rang for prayers you could drop dead, they ran for the prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: They realized where you had come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I suppose so, I had no hair you know.</span> <span id="s894">Then I decided okay, Frankfurt under order I’m not safe there and that forged the mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Who brought Frankfurt under order, did you suspect that was a possibility or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: I knew, I knew that was all pressured by them, my instinct, and then we got on the train with other prisoners of war, not only us, but men too and we go to Berlin, and in Berlin there is the camp, the displaced person camp in a former hospital, and we all got there.</span> <span id="s897">The Arangostrasse.</span> <span id="s898">And then we all got very happily together and in the meantime, that was all Russian, and then the English came in, and the Americans were supposed to, that was the time when Berlin was supposed to be divided, and I stayed in Berlin until the Americans came in, to get a transfer to Frankfurt, and we stayed there in the Arangostrasse and the English came in and everybody asked us and the Russian soldiers were marching about again.</span> <span id="s899">My friend and I we were walking and we all had watches you know and, whatever you found you had then.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Whatever you found where?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: You liberated things, whatever was lying around you picked it up.</span> <span id="s902">She had a watch and we had an alarm clock in our bag, in our room there, whatever it was, and one day the alarm rang and the Russian was in there and he shot at the alarm bell, he had never seen an alarm clock.</span> <span id="s903">Animals I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s904">So then we were walking down the street one day and a Russian comes towards us and whips the watch off her arm, not mine and she said oh my God what now, and I said nothing, and he gave her a diamond watch, he didn’t know that you wind a watch, so she had a diamond watch, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s905">And then I met an English soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: He didn’t know, he just exchanged watches...?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Because he didn’t know you have to wind a watch.</span> <span id="s908">And I’ll never forget that Russian officer, he told me exactly what would happen, the majority of the troops they are animals, and he was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: The one who called you oranka?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Animals and indeed they were.</span> <span id="s911">.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Even in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Oh yes, all over.</span> <span id="s914">The Americans did their own share I’m sure.</span> <span id="s915">So the English came to me and he was Jewish and he said is there any message I can send for you and I said yes, I have a brother in England and the last address was (word missing in original transcript) minster something, he was on a children’s transport, but they had their own office in London where they registered all these kids and I would appreciate it if you could tell him that I’m alive and well, more or less well and that I’m in Berlin and will go to Frankfurt and that was that.</span> <span id="s916">And ultimately the Americans came in and I had my papers stamped Frankfurt on Meind and everybody wanted to know how I had Frankfurt on Meind in the first place coming from the east zone, but I did, and we proceeded French soldiers and everybody on a bus towards the western zone, and we get to the Russian checkpoint and the soldier said want to have the girls, but by that time they couldn’t do their hanky – panky so they said well you can’t cross, so the French soldiers they were talking about swimming across the Elbe and they did, and they said can you swim and I said yes.</span> <span id="s917">They contacted the English Red Cross in Hemsted which is near the Elbe and in the night we swam across the Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: The Russians would not let you cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No.</span> <span id="s920">They wanted a girl.</span> <span id="s921">They looked for some (word missing in original transcript) and we said no, and the French and ourselves we put the bundles on our head and we swam across in the night across the Elbe and the moment we landed the English were standing there with blankets and tea, and that’s how I got across, and from there there was a tremendous mob and tremendous destruction, and I made my way to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">QL: In terms of meeting Germans even when you came back to the Organisher camp there, how did you feel toward the Germans that you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Terrified.</span> <span id="s924">Didn’t want to talk to them, but then again the treatment from the Russians, you know I didn’t know who to hate more, and then I went to the gardenstrasse which was erected again for the purpose of collecting Jews and I said I’m looking for my relatives and they said oh yes Mr. and Mrs.(word missing in original transcript) live there and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: You mean they had come back from Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yes.........And I had a turban around my hair and I looked a mess, but I had eaten already and I looked kind of filled out and I walked towards, I knew Frankfurt, and walking was no problem at that time, I was so used to it, and I find my aunt’s house and I ring the bell and she’s not home, and just then she walks down the street and says oh my God look at the gypsy in front of my house, and she saw me and I can’t describe, it was absolutely horrifying, and she couldn’t get over it, so after the preliminary greetings, and my uncle almost, he couldn’t speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: He’s the one who was an amputee, and he was able to survive Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yes, and she had a maid already you know.</span> <span id="s929">She was settled already in Frankfurt, and he had extra rations and now everything was forgotten, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Were these rations obtained through the Judeshegemeinde?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: No, through the government, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: By the government you mean the occupation government?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: No, the German government, the German government gave us everything.</span> <span id="s934">We had everything double, everything.</span> <span id="s935">There wasn’t enough, but we had everything double, and then after that and everything and we settled down, and of course eventually I had a bed, for at least a week every morning she found me on the floor.</span> <span id="s936">I couldn’t get used to it, and we didn’t have central heating so we had to light the oven, the stove and she had to (word missing in original transcript) everything back by then, you know the maid, and one morning she starts screaming what are you doing, for me it was nothing you used to ((word missing in original transcript) the knife to cut wood, why not, it’s a knife.</span> <span id="s937">I had lost contact with the work, with living, but I would say within a month I was back.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Just speaking of a knife, those thoughts never occurred to me, but during this whole time any food that you got, did you ever get silverware?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s940">A spoon, a knife, there was no worry that, in fact there was no suicide.</span> <span id="s941">In all these years there was not one suicide.</span> <span id="s942">Isn’t that strange.</span> <span id="s943">Not one.</span> <span id="s944">No suicide whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: I wasn’t even thinking in terms of suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: They didn’t have to be afraid of us, a knife, they had ten machine guns versus a knife.</span> <span id="s947">They were not afraid of us one bit.</span> <span id="s948">Warsaw was the only uprising anywhere so they...</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: No I was thinking in terms of human things, you know, a fork and a knife.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: We had the implement of sewing things, sometimes they took a needle away from us so we hid them in a toothbrush we were allowed to keep.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: How did you get them, the needles?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: From people.</span> <span id="s953">I had an elephant given to me when I was a young girl and I kept that in my garter.</span> <span id="s954">I kept that everywhere and in Stuthof I lost it, and that meant so much to me that when I lost it I was petrified.</span> <span id="s955">That was my good luck charm.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: When you came back to Frankfurt it must have been difficult to walk around and see what the intervening years had done.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: I was thrilled, everything was bombed.</span> <span id="s958">I was rather pleased.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Any contact with the Germans when you started to go out shopping, just in the streets, what were your feelings about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Fear, but then I can imagine that some didn’t know, they were nice and said they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s961">For instance my aunt had a maid and after a few days (sentence incomplete)), I guess I don’t do anything good enough for you, I wasn’t thinking of picking up my underwear or brushing my shoes or hanging up my clothes.</span> <span id="s962">Really I had lost complete contact with anything like that and she was offended, so my aunt explained to her to give me time.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: How did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Readjust?</span> <span id="s965">With love.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Mainly from your aunt and uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: And everybody around me.</span> <span id="s968">Oh it wasn’t long, but then the final blow, oh yes then all the way back from Berlin and everywhere I looked for my mother.</span> <span id="s969">Everybody looked for everybody.</span> <span id="s970">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s971">And my aunt and I when we were still in Frankfurt, when we saw a blond woman we ran.</span> <span id="s972">That was the hardest for both of us to accept that my mother was gone.</span> <span id="s973">We couldn’t accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: When you say you walked back even through Poland, how did you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Oh the roads were full of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: So you went up to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: The roads were full of prisoners, it was just one mad conglomeration from everywhere.</span> <span id="s978">Of course we all had the same problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: You all had</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s981">But the best thing was the Germans who couldn’t escape they all shaved their hair and put on prisoner garb, and they said down with your pants.</span> <span id="s982">Nobody was circumcised in Germany unless they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s983">They caught many.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: They did?</span> <span id="s985">When you say the men, who was it that did the catching, all these prisoners on the roads, all these people on the roads coming home?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: No, what happened was there were still Russians around and suddenly there were Germans who were with us who we didn’t know or maybe who looked too healthy, and the men would report the to the Russians.</span> <span id="s987">Once we were free we had the upper hand.</span> <span id="s988">Down with your pants, suddenly they discovered in the men’s room no circumcision.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: The same in reverse.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: The same wouldn’t work today.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: No, but what I meant was very often they caught Jews in the early years that way.</span> <span id="s992">What was the mood, I mean there must have been a tremendous amount of bitterness.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Bitterness beyond belief, but I don’t know anymore, my aunt and uncle had many old friends who came back, Germans who knew (word missing in original transcript) so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s994">I wanted to get out for sure, and I was immediately contacted when I asked for my license, please start working immediately.</span> <span id="s995">No I won’t my license was issued for Jews only, so I worked in an office.</span> <span id="s996">I worked for the father of Rabbi Nulhaus.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: He had come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Back from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s999">He was the only rabbi in this whole district and I had unfortunately the unique ability of knowing who went where because I went last, also I was blessed with a very good memory.</span> <span id="s1000">Also I helped him with statistics, and soldiers came in and asked about their relatives and many times, why are you alive, I had to excuse myself for being alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: I’ve heard that and I’ve read that in various places that must be a very difficult feeling to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Horrible, in the mountains, why are you alive, you must have been an S.S. girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1003">That’s hard to take, why are you alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: You definitely didn’t want to stay in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Were you able then to find out what happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes, we heard then, but the best part comes now, my uncle after a month, worked in the Judeshegemeinde and he couldn’t wear his (word missing in original transcript) so he used a cane and I brought him lunch every day, so while I was there while he had lunch, and also he spoke English fluently because he was educated in England as a young man, so his presence was very much needed, so I sit in his office while I brought lunches and a messenger comes in, Mr. Stern there is an English soldier to see you, okay fine (word missing in original transcript) because I still felt very self conscious with my turban and everything, no stay here, it won’t take long, and in comes this English soldier grinning from ear to ear, giving me a hello, God here comes another one, my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: It must have been quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: My brother.</span> <span id="s1010">In fact he had walked to my aunt’s house and she told me where we are and he had a car right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: He was with the British army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Yes, a car with a driver.</span> <span id="s1013">I couldn’t believe it, my little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: When was the last time you had seen him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: in ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: How old was he then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: He was 14.</span> <span id="s1018">My knees gave way.</span> <span id="s1019">He didn’t hear then in Berlin that I was alive, you know the message I had sent, and I can’t tell you the feeling, and I didn’t know him, and he knew me in spite of my terrible get up, and the first thing, I don’t want you to see me that way.</span> <span id="s1020">I always said that was a mishugass.</span> <span id="s1021">I didn’t want anybody to see me that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: That’s interesting, you said before when they first shaved your head you were all in the same boat and now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Also I had it shaved again because of the typhus, so it would grow back and from lice I had terrible boils on my head.</span> <span id="s1024">It wouldn’t heal because I wouldn’t get rid of the lice.</span> <span id="s1025">My aunt finally poured peroxide on my head and it healed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: You had it shaved the second time in Lutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes, and then of course my brother brought us all kinds of food, and also my aunt had many friends, that’s how I met my husband’s sister, they all came to us, they were sent to us, and they brought us food, and I ate and I ate, I went up like a yeast cake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: How much did you weigh when you came back to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: About 110 or so, which was a lot, I would have been less if I hadn’t always been so fat and my aunt even said to my brother, (sentence incomplete) I always ate, my mouth was never still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Was there a question of food shortages at all, I mean even before your brother was bringing things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No there was enough, my aunt was an artist, she could fix a gourmet meal out of canned food, K rations, everything she touched, when she finished was a gourmet meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: K rations were the American...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes and the corned beef and everything, when she got through with it it was like beef stroganoff and of course at that time anything was good, and then he disappeared somewhere in thin air, he was stationed somewhere else and didn’t write and then we were worried about him because he left somewhere on an unauthorized leave to Frankfurt and he went to the (word missing in original transcript) strasse and he asked for his sister, and that’s how he found me.</span> <span id="s1034">And I asked did it ever occur to you that I might not be there anymore, and he said no I knew you would make it.</span> <span id="s1035">And then he said I don’t want you to come to England because they don’t pay well, because I wanted to get out, Israel was out because I heard what was going on there with the ships and I began to hate to be amongst Jews all the time because there was so much friction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: You mentioned that you had the opportunity to go to Israel when you were in Lutch, had you known then what was going on already with the ships?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No, but being integrated most of my life, I didn’t want to be isolated, and I felt that Israel’s the land of hardship without knowing anything and I didn’t want any more hardship.</span> <span id="s1038">And then my aunt and uncle applied immediately for visas to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Their son had gone there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yes, and for me too, but it was easy for him to get his parents over there very quickly, but there is a question about how long I would have to stay and I certainly didn’t want them to wait for me, so then through (word missing in original transcript) I applied for a visa here, and friends of my family saw my name in the aufbrau and they sponsored me, and so what shall I tell you I got my visa and everything and even then the Americans were peculiar on my (word missing in original transcript) there was another anti – Semite there and I had pneumonia and Lord knows what diseases and I had a spot on my lung, you have T.B., I didn’t have T.B., you look like a blimp, you didn’t have T.B. looking like me.</span> <span id="s1041">I didn’t have a cough or nothing.</span> <span id="s1042">Okay after three x – rays I got my visa.</span> <span id="s1043">And the day I left for America my Australian visa came through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s1046">I wanted to be with my relatives, But then I was committed.</span> <span id="s1047">So there I came all by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: I was just going to ask, they were going to Australia and your brother was going back to England, did the pay make that much difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Well he felt that I couldn’t support myself, and then when I got here all Jewish girls from England started to come here, there really was no future there evidently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: How did you feel about coming here all by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Petrified, but I had many friends here.</span> <span id="s1052">My mother’s friends took me in and other friends, I was alone but I was never, I was used to being alone.</span> <span id="s1053">Almost from 18 to 27, nine years I was used to being alone, not all alone, but I had no family all this time, except my relatives, but then saying good – bye to my aunt and uncle was very hard, but I went to America and I adjusted very fast, oh my.</span> <span id="s1054">I learned English one, two, three, I got myself a job, but I was alone and I looked, I was so fat, my gosh, everyone was married, everybody said she’s so pretty, but she’s so fat and I ate, I’d go to (word missing in original transcript) for dinner and pass a delicatessen and say now I’ll go to my furnished room and eat half a pound of (word missing in original transcript) and I ate, and everybody said I was too fat and I couldn’t stop eating and then I started smoking, maybe that will help.</span> <span id="s1055">And then I met through a nurse, she had a friend a Viennese guy who was an endocrinologist and she sent me to him and he felt sorry for me and didn’t charge me his usual exorbitant fee.</span> <span id="s1056">Four dollars a week at that time was a lot of money for me and something was wrong with my period too and he was my psychiatrist, my friend, my weight loser and I went down and down .</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Was it a result of the shots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: No starvation.</span> <span id="s1059">And this doctor, at that time the drug and food control was not that strict and he imported something from Canada which you couldn’t get here.</span> <span id="s1060">I didn’t ask questions, he didn’t do it very scientifically either, but he helped me and I stayed thin, he never put me on a crash diet, a moderate diet, and I went down, and stayed down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: When you first came here who met you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Oh my friend of my mother and other people, everybody met me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: She’s the one who sponsored...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: No that was another one, she came too.</span> <span id="s1065">A friend of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s1066">161st Street.</span> <span id="s1067">They all came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Did you stay with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: How did you go about getting a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Then I went to the (word missing in original transcript) ), stupid idiot, and I had my nurses papers and my uncle had that famous license that said only for Jews and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Had you given them that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1074">He was in South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: He was in South America?</span> <span id="s1076">Had you mailed it to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: My mother had mailed it to him, with the auspices of maybe sending for me, and then what did you ask now, oh yes how I got the job, oh yes you can’t work as a nurse you can’t speak English, you’d better work as a governess or a nursemaid, and I didn’t want to be a burden to anybody, so I went to the HIAS and I couldn’t get any money from them, I had to work six weeks, and I said what do I do in the meantime, I’ve got no money so I said the hell with you, and in the Times I saw an ad that this family on 77th Street was looking for a nursemaid, I can’t speak English, terrible brats and a shvatzer maid and they said I was to eat with them and when the time came I ate with the shvatzer, and she was so nice and she said I know honey chile you have never seen a black woman before, and she was so good to me, and she said to me after I had one day off, one afternoon off a week, she said you know you are wasting your time if you are a nurse.</span> <span id="s1078">Go get yourself a job as a nurse, so I looked in the Times and I had many nurse friends here from my school, and I found two jobs, one at Montefiore and one at Memorial and I won’t forget I looked in the paper and I called up my old instructor who two years ago just died and said Mrs. Holzer where should In go, Montefiore, I like the name so much, it sounds so nice, or should I go to Jewish Memorial.</span> <span id="s1079">She said go to Jewish Memorial because so many of the nurses from Frankfurt are there and especially one nurse, go there.</span> <span id="s1080">I did, and the job was for the operating room, not knowing the language I thought I have some experience, I can work much easier in the operating room and so I went there and I met this one nurse there who I didn’t know from Frankfurt because she left before I went there and she became my best friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: When you say that you were with this family on 77th Street how were you able to communicate with this black lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Oh I knew some English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Was that a hardship to pick it up, the English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: No very easy, at that time I always say that I wasn’t an honor student and nothing especially in school ever and between the time I got here and ‘55 was the height of my mental ability.</span> <span id="s1085">I could learn just everything at this time.</span> <span id="s1086">I don’t know why this happened.</span> <span id="s1087">It was such an unusual thing for me.</span> <span id="s1088">I could just pick up and learn everything in no time.</span> <span id="s1089">I had no high school paper, I had to take a high school equivalency test, which I barely passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Did you have to pass a certification nursing boards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1092">There was a nurse in Brooklyn who specialized in preparing foreign nurses for the state boards, and every week I traipsed myself from 168th Street to Grand Army Plaza, and walked to her house, it was everything beautiful then, no danger, I started from here to Brooklyn and she had enough time, you know.</span> <span id="s1093">And I remember there was an old Jewish candy store and I ordered (word missing in original transcript)) because I was so under nourished.</span> <span id="s1094">I had myself a hot chocolate with ice cream.</span> <span id="s1095">He waited for me and then I had my lecture and she prepared me and in ’49 I took my state boards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Let me ask you something, just in terms of eating, lots of people feel that eating helps you to, eating can be a substitute.</span> <span id="s1097">I eat sometimes when I am very nervous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: No, I drink and I smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: But when you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: No it wasn’t nerves, and I was lonesome.</span> <span id="s1101">And I had a room with two very nice looking girls and they always had dates, and I you can’t help it she’s too fat for me, and I was lonesome, and I met Bernard not as a boyfriend, but as my girlfriend’s brother, and I beat him in ping pong and that fat slob beating me in ping pong, that was no good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: As you lost weight and began to go out did you date American men or the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Mainly America men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: How did you feel about American men as opposed to the German – Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: I liked them better.</span> <span id="s1106">Because still I felt I had to make excuses for being alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: How did that, you felt that to American men it was different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: No question because they didn’t lose anybody in Germany number one, and number two, I was so eager to assimilate here.</span> <span id="s1109">In fact that was a psychological copout.</span> <span id="s1110">I wanted to forget that I ever was German.</span> <span id="s1111">I thought I could erase it, but you don’t want to forget your heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: No, but it’s understandable to want to forget it at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Even today, and I didn’t want to be called a refugee because I wasn’t a refugee, I was an immigrant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Were you ever called a refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yes, and Bernard it was the same, he came after the war, very often people in business would still consider us the refugees, and he said once, he’s not a refugee.........Adding insult to injury.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: In terms of that when you called, I don’t know whether it was direct or indirect, called a refugee, didn’t that...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Annoys the hell out of me, absolutely, because I wish I were a refugeee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: In what way did they make you feel a refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: You know how all Americans, we have a German mentality and we have an accent.</span> <span id="s1120">They still consider us different, and also when the refugees really came, you know people don’t assimilate.</span> <span id="s1121">I’ve been told I speak English better than people who have been here a long time because I really made a career out of it, you know, to assimilate, and therefore I felt more comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: When you say you made a career out of it you mean you made a conscious effort.</span> <span id="s1123">What things did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Well I worked all the time.</span> <span id="s1125">I couldn’t go to school, but I read and I went to the movies and I spoke English as much as I could, even up to this day I correct people when they speak German when it isn’t necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: How did you meet these American fellows that you were dating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Here, there, and everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: You lived in Washington Heights and you worked in Jewish Memorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: I met through there, the hospital, and I went to dances, you know, at that time we still had like the singles clubs today and I met then here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Did you join any organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Yes the American Jewish Women or something like it, Hadassah, something, it was an American group, and I went to an American singles summer resort.</span> <span id="s1132">It was called a camp.</span> <span id="s1133">It was like a singles club, and that’s where I met.</span> <span id="s1134">I never went to a German club,</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: You wouldn’t go to the New World Club, or things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A; I was tired of excusing myself for being alive, and then of course everyone wanted to fix me up, I have a man for you.</span> <span id="s1137">One woman, she had two spinsters, one was much older, after all I was still only 29 or so, and she gave the wrong name to the wrong fellow and I ended up with this old guy and the other woman probably ended up with someone younger than her.</span> <span id="s1138">In the Cafe Paris it was all straightened out, but then I was very often on call as an operating room nurse which interfered with my social life to a great extent.</span> <span id="s1139">And war came and all these other people could take off, when I wanted it to be a veteran it helped.</span> <span id="s1140">When I had a blind date and as I said many were blind I said oh I have to call the hospital, I’m on call.</span> <span id="s1141">I have to go to work and very often I had to go straight to the hospital and then home...How many people had a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Are most of your friends today Americans or of the German – Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: German – Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Why do you think that persisted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Because ultimately I came to peace with myself and my relatives and my friends we have a common interest and we have very good friends in Washington, they used to live here, but I never made it happen that way it just evolved that way, I never made a conscious effort, but that’s how it is.</span> <span id="s1146">In the Temple most of the people, you know, but I didn’t make a conscious effort.</span> <span id="s1147">We very often talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: You mean with your husband, or among the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: No, we talk about it.</span> <span id="s1150">We very often in previous years, we don’t have much of a social life.</span> <span id="s1151">Bernard isn’t too well, but we very often were invited by our German friends or relatives, had Americans to entertain as a bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Did you feel you were that bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: In what sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: You don’t know us well enough so I can’t explain it to you.</span> <span id="s1156">I feel both my husband and I are more all around, not more educated, by no means, no smarter, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1157">I’m not being arrogant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: More international?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Do you feel that happened to you as a result of the experience with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: With Riva, her German roots are much deeper than mine, or Elsa Baum, you know, now they contrast with Eleanor even though she is younger, because she’s more Americanized even though my best friends are all German – Jewish background, we have more thing in common, but I can mix in anywhere.</span> <span id="s1162">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: When you talk about your German roots, we were talking about that yesterday as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1164">How do you feel about your German roots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Well as I said to you in the beginning I am very happy about my childhood.</span> <span id="s1166">I had a good upbringing, maybe too strict.</span> <span id="s1167">I don’t know if that is damage, but I wasn’t overindulged.</span> <span id="s1168">I had the proper values.</span> <span id="s1169">I didn’t have an orthodox Jewish education, but I had a Jewish background, but the positive things we have like being industrious and being conscientious, in America sometimes being laughed at.</span> <span id="s1170">I always say we take ourselves too seriously, because American people by and large they get things done the same way ultimately, but that you cannot lose no matter how young you were or how old you were it’s in you.</span> <span id="s1171">Am I right?</span> <span id="s1172">I have made a very thorough study of myself and very often I hate myself, very often there are things like my compulsiveness, that’s unterborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Well unterborn in the sense that it is a German – Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: That’s true with so many things that we have that we can’t change, but I know we are being laughed at, rightly so, we have a certain arrogance.</span> <span id="s1175">I never talk about (word missing in original transcript), that I really hate, that the Americans were being confronted with at the height of the immigration.</span> <span id="s1176">And they never forgot it, they never did.</span> <span id="s1177">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Did you ever go back to Germany after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yes, what a disaster, ask Bernard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: You went together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Once I went with my brother and he asked me before I crossed the border in ’57, now I know how you feel, I don’t want to have a fist flight because of you, so we get to the border and I can’t speak German.</span> <span id="s1182">It didn’t come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Literally you couldn’t say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: It couldn’t come out.</span> <span id="s1185">In my home town a girl was walking ahead of me and she dropped something.</span> <span id="s1186">I wanted to tell her you dropped your comb, of course she didn’t pay any attention to me and suddenly my brother grins and he said she can’t understand you, and I tried to get it out in German and I couldn’t, and then we visited our maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: You went back to Kassel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Was that the first time since the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1191">We visited our maid and then I could speak, I had to.</span> <span id="s1192">By that time I had lost my weight also, and she yelled and she still said (sentence incomplete), we had a hard time speaking German, but I could do it then, but I would say among strangers I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: How did you feel in ’57 being back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Uneasy, very uneasy.</span> <span id="s1195">Then my brother had the gall, these people are different, they didn’t go through what I did, he had a friend, my brother was then an interrogation officer, (sentence incomplete).</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: With the British army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1198">This friend ultimately married one of these women who were supposedly being turned over into (word missing in original transcript) whatnot, and they got married and (word missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1199">And my brother (word missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1200">And she was talking about the time she was a prisoner of war and she was so annoyed because these British officers didn’t hold the door open for me.</span> <span id="s1201">Well I almost threw up.</span> <span id="s1202">I said to her you know that was nothing compared to the way we were treated.</span> <span id="s1203">You were treated royally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Did she comment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1206">That was a bad experience.</span> <span id="s1207">I was glad when I was back in England, or in France or anyplace.</span> <span id="s1208">We drove and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Could you go to your house in Kassel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: It wasn’t there and I was very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1211">And then I went with Bernard.</span> <span id="s1212">We only went once to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Did you have a different experience when you went together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Worse.</span> <span id="s1215">We went to, oh yes one time Bernard was offered a job where his German language knowledge would help and he was supposed to be stationed somewhere in Munchen and we already figured out I’d stay in London and he’d, the whole thing fell through, so ultimately we went to Germany because Bernard wanted to attend the (word missing in original transcript) and everything, and I said I can’t be a chicken and let him go by himself, I’ll go with him.</span> <span id="s1216">Well it was a disaster.</span> <span id="s1217">I was so obnoxious and so frightened I was impossible.</span> <span id="s1218">Everybody was my enemy, and then in Frankfurt he got, we had ordered special seats in the railroad and Bernard said you stay here, but Frankfurt was just like I had left it.</span> <span id="s1219">You stay here, I’ll get the seat tickets.</span> <span id="s1220">So I stand there and everybody who walks by I think a Nazi, and I stay here and Bernard is gone.</span> <span id="s1221">He doesn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1222">What have they done to him?</span> <span id="s1223">By this time I was in a different world.</span> <span id="s1224">When this man came back I was such a bundle of nerves.</span> <span id="s1225">I didn’t let go, and we decided from now on Germany for me is taboo.</span> <span id="s1226">That’s all.</span> <span id="s1227">I don’t have to go there.</span> <span id="s1228">It’s not important.</span> <span id="s1229">I don’t say that I’m right.</span> <span id="s1230">Don’t misunderstand me.</span> <span id="s1231">It’s not a question of right or wrong.</span> <span id="s1232">It’s just something I don’t want anymore as much as I can’t stand when anybody says_____________________________, I really applaud.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: In terms of that when you saw Germany, I take it the second trip was after ’57?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Yes ’69.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: When you see the condition of Germany today in terms of it’s being rebuilt, it doesn’t bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: No, it’s alright with me.</span> <span id="s1237">I’ve never seen Kassel before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: You are from Kassel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1240">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1241">I enjoyed being there, we went to a little restaurant, everything was fine, but that Frankfurt and that Bauhof, that did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Have you ever been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: No, never, simply because we never had enough time and I don’t want to go by myself.</span> <span id="s1244">They had a special memorial plaque for all the people who had perished.</span> <span id="s1245">I didn’t much care for that.</span> <span id="s1246">It’s not that I didn’t care for it, it shook me up, it really did.</span> <span id="s1247">I mean for me to go to Germany is totally unnecessary, as I say I don’t even want to bother changing it.</span> <span id="s1248">Let the hate be, and also I had a terrible, now two years ago when I went to St. Elizabeth, of all people there is a German (word missing in original transcript) working there as a nurse, big mouth, a kraut, not a Jewish girl, a real (word missing in original transcript), a big mouth, everything bad, a good worker and many remarks she made in her tactless way, my God what do I need an anti – Semite here, and then I found out she is married to a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s1249">It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: But it’s initial reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: But still she grinds me, but I always say as long as she does her work, it’s all I care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: This reaction in ’69 and ’57 was it different than when you came back after the war in ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1254">I felt much more at home then.</span> <span id="s1255">I had been in America.</span> <span id="s1256">I didn’t feel that badly then, I wanted to get out, but after all that was it.</span> <span id="s1257">I didn’t feel half as bad being there then than I did coming back.</span> <span id="s1258">Maybe it was just a delayed reaction, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1259">The mere fact that I didn’t want to go to Israel, I wanted to go back to Germany must mean something, that there was more culture there, there was more normal living there than in Poland where I had been, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Were you also going back to Germany with the hope that maybe you’d find somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Not in ’57, I mean originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: No.</span> <span id="s1264">I knew there wasn’t anybody.</span> <span id="s1265">There were plenty of people in my camp, I knew.</span> <span id="s1266">I knew.</span> <span id="s1267">That wasn’t the idea, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: I mean in terms of an uncle and aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1270">That’s why I went back.</span> <span id="s1271">I knew if I would find them I had to go there, including my brother.</span> <span id="s1272">I knew if I found anybody or my mother that has to be the point of meeting them again, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1273">Oh yes, that’s why I was determined to go to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: One last thing, in terms of the Geidegutmacher, what do you think of the idea?</span> <span id="s1275">The principle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: The principle is alright, but again unfortunately with my extreme hate I didn’t apply for it.</span> <span id="s1277">I couldn’t get myself to apply for it.</span> <span id="s1278">I wanted nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1279">I just get the minimum with the least effort I could possibly do.</span> <span id="s1280">Of course it is an utterly ridiculous thing to even try and make up and I also feel that the German government is being pumped, because this is a life long affair, but I don’t feel sorry for it, I know that many people get Geidegutmacher that they don’t deserve, but good for them, none of my business, but I do find it so sad that everybody says (word missing in original transcript), we have a member of the congregation, he has said repeatedly, we got together socially, _____________________, I never, I can’t stand the man, and I said why don’t you go, no more people are there now, go, and very few go to stay, they just rub it in to all these Americans where they come from and all the sermons they have, and all the things they did and all the education and somehow it is not right and that is why we are called refugees, after the war.</span> <span id="s1281">This is the epitome of a German Jew, a refugee because it is the first generation of refugees where America(illegible) built, there are other refugees from the eastern European.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1283">It was a different experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Everybody came then as they come from Russia now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Well I think the ones who come from Russia now are a little more like the ones who came from Germany, than like the immigration from Russia at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s1286">Did you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: No.</span></p> <p><span
