Fred Lorber is in Des Moines, Iowa.</span> <span id="s13">This conversation is being taped over the phone.</span> <span id="s14">Fred, can you tell me where and when you were born, and your name at birth, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: I was born in Vienna, Austria, at that time an independent country, on November the 23rd, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s17">And your name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My name was the same, except I changed my first name; it was Fritz, and when I came to the United States, it was changed to Fred.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Otherwise we – all names are the same, l-o-r-b-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s22">And can you tell me where and when your parents were born, along with their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s24">My father was born in 1898 in Nadworna, which is a small town in western Poland, and he left there just at the beginning, or before the start of World War I, and emigrated to Vienna.</span> <span id="s25">My mother was born of five children.</span> <span id="s26">Excuse me, my dad was of – was one of two children – two or three, and I don’t quite recall.</span> <span id="s27">My mother was one of five, and she and her parents left Belz, b-e-l-z, Poland.</span> <span id="s28">Again, that was under the governing ship of Austria at that time, before the first World War, and when the war broke out, my grandfather apparently had a general store in Belz, and they buried all their merchandise, because they felt that the war would be taking place where they lived, and they went on to the west, and they ended up with relatives in Budapest for a very short time; then emigrated to Vienna at the beginning of World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How old were your parents around one – World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: My parents were in their late 30s.</span> <span id="s31">Excuse me, when – you mean when they left?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Wh-When they got to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: They were very young.</span> <span id="s34">I think – well, 1914 when the war broke out, so they were either 16 or 17 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And how did they meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: That is a puzzle.</span> <span id="s37">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s38">I think that the Jewish population of Vienna was pretty large.</span> <span id="s39">I think the city itself was – had a population of about two and a half million, and about 200,000 were Jewish.</span> <span id="s40">And so apparently the people that came from the same areas in the – eastern Europe, because the Hapsburg Empire at that time was really large, before the first World War, and encompassed much of western Poland, and Czechoslovakia and went as far as down to northern – what later became northern Italy.</span> <span id="s41">And so there was a lot of social activity going on, and I really don’t quite know how they really met.</span> <span id="s42">All I knew that I was a child that really be – that came in 1923, so the war was over in 1918, so this was a very difficult economic time, and I – not very much was talked about on how they met, and I really never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did they speak –</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I should have been much more inquisitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What – what language did they speak with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: They spoke German and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s47">And my – I think they both knew some Polish, but I don’t think – think – because their schooling both was done in ger – in German, because I think that the Austrian empire at that time went as far east as where they lived.</span> <span id="s48">And most of the Jewish populations in these small cities, either had a chayder, which was a religious school, where things were taught in Hebrew and in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s49">And then I think there was another school that I attended, which was in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: What kind of – o-obviously they were Jewish, what kind of religious backgrounds did they have?</span> <span id="s51">Did they have different tradition –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Ah, it was Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Both of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Semi-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s55">Modern Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Mod-Modern Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yeah, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did – did they keep a different religious life as adults than they had – had as children?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yeah, we joined a synagogue in – when I grew up.</span> <span id="s60">And I think that was rather late.</span> <span id="s61">At that time there were small, and I think it then continued also in the United States, there were little, itty-bitty storefronts, which functioned at high holidays, and a rabbi somehow, he was – had another job, and then he conducted services at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; the two, you know, very important Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s62">And they were sometimes held at a storefront.</span> <span id="s63">But we belonged to a conservative synagogue in Vienna when I was growing up.</span> <span id="s64">I don’t know what the sh – really religious affiliations were before I was born.</span> <span id="s65">I just never really – was so, I guess involved with the present time, and changes that took place culturally, and language-wise, and new locations, and all the things that took place that I think that the inquisitiveness was not there to find out how all these things really came to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s67">Did your father serve in World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did your father serve in World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span> <span id="s71">He was – I think he was – he must have been 16 – 15 years old, or 16 years old when the war broke – the war broke out in 1914 –</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: ’14?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: – and he was born in 80 ni – in ’98, so, he was 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s75">And he –</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: And I don’t think he was an aus – I think he was a Polish citizen rather than an Austrian one, they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: – became later.</span> <span id="s79">So, he was not drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s81">Did they speak German with you at home –</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: – or you were just – German?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you know Yiddish at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Somewhat, yes.</span> <span id="s87">Not very well, but they did speak Yiddish and German and sometimes fall into Polish, but not very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What part of Vienna did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: In the 20th district, which was a – Vienna had 21 districts, the first district was the inner city, where all the [indecipherable] buildings, museums, and the opera and all the public buildings were and the – was in central Vienna, and it – even though it was the 20th district, it – it joined the second district, which was very – it had a very substantial Jewish population.</span> <span id="s90">The 20th district also had a good size – well, not so [indecipherable] but had a sprinkling of Jewish population.</span> <span id="s91">And it was next to the second district and the first district.</span> <span id="s92">So, it was pretty close within the inner city, even though the numbers really were the disparity.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: What kind of socio-economic groups lived there?</span> <span id="s94">Was this a middle class, a merchant –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Middle class.</span> <span id="s96">I would say middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: And what – what was your – did – did both of your parents work, or only your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No, my mother never worked.</span> <span id="s99">My father worked for a fairly large manufacturing company of textiles, who had plants in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s100">They made tablecloths and towels and other linens, and their headquarters was in the first district in Vienna, and he was one of the sales – started out as one of the salesmen, later became the sales manager for the company for Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Do you recall the company’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s103">Heinrich Klinger, k-l-i-n-g-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: They were on [indecipherable] I remember the address.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Oh, go ahead, give us the address.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: It was on Rudolfplatz(ph) and at least the significant, it stands out in my mind, because the Gestapo later on was kind of cattycorner from – there’s a square, they were on a kind of a small square, if I remember, with trees, and some – a few benches, and diag – di – dial – diagonally – diagonally?</span> <span id="s108">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: There was a hotel, kind of a meet – it wasn’t a luxury hotel, but it was a – it was a good sized hotel called the Metropole Hotel, which later became the SS headquarters and the Gestapo headquarters for – for Austria.</span> <span id="s111">And I’ll refer to it later on, because it did play a part in our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s113">Do you have a sense – do you recall the – the dates that – or maybe even just the years that your father worked there?</span> <span id="s114">Do you know the beginning and the end of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: That’s – I think – I can only give you a rough –</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: – estimate on that.</span> <span id="s118">I think he started working there at the end of – or the beginning of peace, 1919 or 1918, and then became the sales manager, as I mentioned before, I think, for the – for the company, for the city of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s120">Were you born an Austrian citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s123">So your parents would have had Austrian citizenship by the time you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s126">Can you describe a little bit about your childhood memories of school, school friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Was it an integrated group, did you go to a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s130">I went to – the first part I went to called a Volksschule, which is first four grades, and did very – from what I understand, I did very well.</span> <span id="s131">Not because I was so smart, but I think the competition wasn’t very great – it was in a neighborhood school, in a very traditional school building.</span> <span id="s132">It was, as a matter of fact, when I visited Vienna later on, it was still there, and I – really, I think I was a little bit of teacher’s pet, because my parents always got very good reports.</span> <span id="s133">I don’t quite remember the names of the teacher, but there was a close relationship.</span> <span id="s134">In other words, a respect between my parents and the teachers of that school, and I did come out pretty well academically.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: And this was a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: It’s a – no, it’s a sc – well, yes, it was a public school, this one was.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: From there I went to gymnasium, which is a kind of semi-private, or it was really the track up to the university.</span> <span id="s139">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Do you recall which one it was?</span> <span id="s141">The name of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yes, Ul-Ultaberg(ph) gymnasium.</span> <span id="s143">It was named after the street it was on, it was next to a very large well-known park called the Augarten, and it wasn’t very far away from where we lived; I would walk to school.</span> <span id="s144">I took a – used to take me about probably 25 or 30 to 30 fo – maybe 40 minutes, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: And the school did not have a religious denomination?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: They had a religious – they had a – Catholics had a priest come in and the class was separated at that time, twice a week, I think, maybe an hour each time.</span> <span id="s147">The same thing, we had a Jewish rabbi that came in, the students would be pulled out, the Jewish students, and took religious in-instruction.</span> <span id="s148">I think that still is the German way of doing things, I think they still do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Do you recall – sorry – do you recall how many Jewish students went to your grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes, my class had a number of Jewish students, because the neighborhood, you know, where we lived did not have many Jewish people, but there were maybe three to four families on one large city block, or a couple of city blocks.</span> <span id="s151">And further [indecipherable] one fur-further toward the center of the city, the Jewish population became much larger.</span> <span id="s152">So, we did have an – quite a good part, I would say 30 percent of the students must have been Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Now what years –</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: The boys were separated from the girls, and I mentioned before that a rabbi would come in twice – I think once or twice a week, and the Jewish students would be separated again, and would take Jewish instruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And now what years were you at the gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: What year was I at the gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Ah, let’s figure that out.</span> <span id="s159">Had to be from 1930 f – let’s see, I was born in ’23, so six – four – in 10 years, when I was 10 or 11 years old, I went on to gymnasium from Volksschule.</span> <span id="s160">So I would assume I must have been 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Okay, so isn’t that 1934?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s164">And you were at the gymnasium until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: At when – when did you f – did you f – get to finish the gymnasium, or did you have to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No.</span> <span id="s168">It’s an eight year cour – it’s an eight year –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Eight years, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes, so I did the first four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: First four.</span> <span id="s172">So 1934 through 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: That is – so 1938, and when the Nazis took over in March of 1938, by May they told us the Jewish students could no longer go to any public or semi-private school in – in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Okay, now I –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And I got kicked – in other words, all the students got kicked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s177">Now da – I – I just want to go back a little bit –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: – to the 30s.</span> <span id="s180">Do you have – do you have memories of 1933?</span> <span id="s181">Do you have any memories of your parents discussing the Nazi party’s rise to power in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And what are those?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: The – it’s – what stands out in my memory, and it sometimes fades out, but I still remember, in 1938 – January of 1938, at that time the German and Austrian schools had a winter vacation.</span> <span id="s185">In Austria, their national sport is skiing, and soccer.</span> <span id="s186">And I was just – I was put on skis at only six years old.</span> <span id="s187">So, I was with my school on a winter vacation at – at some of the mountains, the [indecipherable] kind of not the Alps, but kind of the foothills of the Alps for one week with my school, skiing – for a skiing vacation.</span> <span id="s188">And it was – had to be January of 1938.</span> <span id="s189">I still remember it because I wa – I participated in a ski race, and I won kind of a little trophy, and I was very proud of it, and I – but by the second run or whatever it is, I ken – I had a bad fall, or whatever it was, and I kind of dislocated my thumb, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s190">So, when my parents picked me up at the railroad station, coming back from that school vacation, they seemed at edge, and explained to me that things were not doing very well.</span> <span id="s191">They had received information and in contact with some friends or relatives in Germany – and as you know, Hitler took over 1933, and at that time, the Nuremberg laws, which this qualified and you know, makes the Jews of Germany not only second class, but third and fourth class citizens and they lost their jobs, particularly if they were government jobs, or sensitive jobs like movies, or livit – or publishing and things like that, the discrimination really was beginning to really hurt in Germany, and my parents were very much aware of it.</span> <span id="s192">So when I di – they picked me up and I still remember they picked me up at a – at the railroad station and on the way home were telling me what was going on politically in Austria at that time.</span> <span id="s193">And it was, if you go back into history, there was a chancellor of Austria, his name was Schuschnigg, and he represented the – kind of a little bit of a also – I would say little bit a of a dictatorship, but not as strongly as what the Nazis had.</span> <span id="s194">He represented the Christian Austrian Christian party, which was the – the Conservative party.</span> <span id="s195">Vienna’s representation was more social democratic, and my father was involved in the social democratic party.</span> <span id="s196">And at that time there were all kinds of demonstrations in Vienna.</span> <span id="s197">The Nazis had become determined again that they were, since 1934 the Nazi party was outlawed in Germany – in Austria, because they had tri-tried to have a putsch, and overthrow the government.</span> <span id="s198">They killed Dollfuss, who was a chancellor, in tr – in trying to do it, but that was aborted, and the Austrian government was able to arrest and – and kill some of the people who tried to overthrow the government, and this – and that time outlawed the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s199">So, in 1938, the beginning, the negotiations were going on between the pr – the president of Austria and Hitler.</span> <span id="s200">He would summon him – Hitler would summon him to Berchtesgaden and really threaten him with all kinds of bad things, and scream at him, and was looking to annex Austria to Germany.</span> <span id="s201">And the guy stood firm, Schuschnigg did, for a while.</span> <span id="s202">So all this demonstration of voting for annexation to Austria, or Austria re-remaining independent, took place in the beginning of 1938.</span> <span id="s203">Some of the negotiations that took place which – in Austria and Germany, that Austria submitted to Germany, and let some people, Nazis, out of prison, and – and also appointed them to certain key jobs within the Austrian government.</span> <span id="s204">Seyss-Inquart was one of them, and I don’t quite remember what names of the other people that became like the commissioner of safety, and some other tr – cabinets – j-jobs, and it really did not look very well for the independence of Austria at that time.</span> <span id="s205">I know a lot of street demonstrations in which my father had participated.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Do you recall –</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: So they were telling me this whole story, what was going on at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Do you recall what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: What they were doing?</span> <span id="s210">They –</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: No, no, do you – do you recall what they were saying to you on the way back from –</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yeah, this is – they told me the politic – about the political situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Okay, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I also remember we went to a movie that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: What was the movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes, if I remember correctly, it was John Hall and Dorothy Lamour.</span> <span id="s217">Some movie called “Hurricane.”</span> <span id="s218">An American movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Was any part of the conversation geared towards –</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I should tell you my grandparents, who lived also in Vienna, had it – owned the movie theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s222">Which movie theater was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: That’s – I’m sorry you asked me that, I don’t remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Do you remember the location?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I could point – I could point it out when – if we would – you go to Vienna with me, I could point it out where the movie was.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: D-Do you remember the approximate location, or what part of town it was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yeah, it was in the 20th district, next – facing a – a park called the Augarten.</span> <span id="s228">And that’s when movies were silent.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Were these your maternal –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: They later on sold – they later – later on, I think gave up that and sold the movie to somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Were these your maternal or paternal grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: My maternal grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Did they speak German well?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Is that something –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: They were fairly – they were well educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: So this would have been a language they spoke back in Poland too?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Do you recall – be-before 1938, do you recall – oh, first of all, did you have any non-Jewish friends, given that you were going to a new school?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes, yes, yes now, quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Do you remember any of their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I played on a soccer team with non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I competed with the – I think that we were 12 and under.</span> <span id="s247">And I had a team that I was part of it, and the day that I got the measles, the day that we was – I remember that, because I couldn’t participate when they played for the city championship.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Do you remember the team’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did – growing up, and this is again, before 1938, an-and because you were in a – in an integrated part of the city, and in a mixed school, did you witness – did you feel any anti-Semitism growing in the 30s, did you witness any violence?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s252">Let me just think for a minute.</span> <span id="s253">There were occasionally some words thrown, anti-Semitic, you know, about Jews, but not too much, because many of my friends were non-Jewish, even though I had my – I also had two cousins to whom I was very close, my mother’s sister’s sons.</span> <span id="s254">And one was same age as I, and one was a year and a half younger.</span> <span id="s255">And they were very di – they, at very young, were very involved in Hashomer Hatzair, which was a left wing of the Zionist movement in Austria.</span> <span id="s256">And I used to also belong to that youth group.</span> <span id="s257">I’d go occasionally.</span> <span id="s258">I wasn’t this vehement about it that – as my two cousins, to whom I was very close.</span> <span id="s259">And we would sometimes walk together.</span> <span id="s260">And I don’t quite remember, and I – I just don’t know if there were ever any anti-Semitic sl – you know, slogans –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Slurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: – or words thrown at us.</span> <span id="s263">I – there must have been, but it may have happened later, and not about that time.</span> <span id="s264">I think I lived a very secure – being an only child, and fairly – my parents, you know, were fairly well-off, and we lived a very comfortable, middle class life, and I was never aware of these things, and I – most of the kids I went to school with – not most, but a great portion of them were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: So, y-you just said that you were a member of Hashomer Hatzair?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: You were not, you were just with your cousins who were.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No, my two cousins were.</span> <span id="s269">Yeah, I went to a couple meetings, and I really wasn’t into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Well, why weren’t you into it?</span> <span id="s271">What was wa – what – what turned you off?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I don’t think of – I think because of maybe my economic status – not mine, but my parents’, and they – I think I was more sheltered, being an only child.</span> <span id="s273">And somehow or other, I don’t know, politically, I think we’re – we were maybe much more assimilated.</span> <span id="s274">My parents are very – they did – they were Zionists, to a degree.</span> <span id="s275">I mean, I remember going to certain propaganda movies that we went to as a family, which there was a tremendous amount – well, actually, tremendous is a little bit – as you know, Herzl the founder of Israel was a li – you know, lived in Austria, lived in Vienna, and there was a – a very strong Zionist Jewish force that really played – played a very, I – I think positive role in the Jewish life of Vienna.</span> <span id="s276">You know, there are 250,000 Jews living, so you had all kinds of political positions and beliefs.</span> <span id="s277">And somehow my two cousins were very much into – into – even though they were one a year younger, and one the same age as me, either 15 and 16 years, or 14 and 15 years old, they went to a lot of those meetings, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s278">Why?</span> <span id="s279">I still question it because later on I became very strong, both in my, you know, in my l-living here in Iowa, I was very involved in Jewish affairs, I was president of federation, I was president of annual drive, and I’ve been participatory in national politics, you know, with AIPAC and some other organizations.</span> <span id="s280">So, it’s – it – that time, for some reason, I was much more assimilated.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So you said that your father was active in social democratic circles?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Do you know whether he had been always politically active since his – since a young age, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I don’t think he ro – I don’t think he had a very, very important role.</span> <span id="s285">I just knew that he came home, there was a lot of street demonstrations, and he came home sometimes hoarse, he couldn’t speak because all the slogans they would throw out, you know, doing their demonstrations.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: So you’re – you’re – you kee – you don’t recall whether he had been politically engaged before the early tim – 30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Oh, not very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: He was busy working.</span> <span id="s290">He, I remember, use – used to bring work home, like pricing inventory, things like that, and then – so he was very ambitious and very hardworking.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What did your mother do during her days?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: She was a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did she have any –</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: She read books, she baked and cooked and had a number of friends.</span> <span id="s295">I remember she’s had – she had two – two or three – two sisters and two – two brothers.</span> <span id="s296">One brother.</span> <span id="s297">One la – one moved.</span> <span id="s298">One emigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s299">I think there were five children.</span> <span id="s300">Karl(ph) – I’m trying to remember.</span> <span id="s301">So she had [indecipherable] you know, three siblings, or four, living in Vienna, and she had a number of very close friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did your family keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Did they what?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Did they keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: No.</span> <span id="s306">They keep [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s307">I shouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s308">They kept kosher the way we had no pork, or we had nothing that was not kosher, but it wasn’t a strict type of kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did you mix meat and dairy?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I think they were a little careful about that.</span> <span id="s311">Maybe on the outside we did, but not in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Did she have any – did she have any help around the house?</span> <span id="s313">Did you have a – a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes, yes, we had a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Did – did you have a nanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No.</span> <span id="s317">She – the maids came – did not live with us.</span> <span id="s318">She came in once a week and cleaned.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: And do you recall whether she was gentile or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: She was gentile.</span> <span id="s321">As a matter of fact, she threatened us.</span> <span id="s322">Or not threatened, but I think she came and demanded money after the Nazis took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: What – what was her claim?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: She just came and wanted money, otherwise she said she would report us to the local Nazi party.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And did she say –</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I don’t quite remember, except my mother was – did give her money a few times.</span> <span id="s327">We were fairly not – somewhat affluent, and – because I remember that – that many Jewish people had no money, my parents used to dish out money.</span> <span id="s328">And there was a – a system where rel – if you had relatives, for example, in the United States, and they had poor people, or people who ran out of money, or had – didn’t have jobs, to try to help the people in Vienna.</span> <span id="s329">And the official rates, you know, of – later, after the Nazi occupation of marks – before it was shillings, then now it became mark, that – let’s assume that it took 10 marks, or five marks for one dollar.</span> <span id="s330">There’s a black market thing going on and you would have to pay 20 marks for one dollar.</span> <span id="s331">And this way – my parents would give money out that way to people who really needed it, and the relatives who – to put some money into a bank account in – in New York, that my parents had.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: This would be your mother’s brother, who had emigrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s334">Was somebody that yes, I think they probably did establish some bank account.</span> <span id="s335">So when we came to the United States, there was some money that allowed us – that allowed my par – I’ll tell you about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Okay, let’s go forward to 1938.</span> <span id="s337">Oh – ho-how do you remember that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Well, I remember coming back from my – as I mentioned before, coming back from vacation and going back to school, and knowing what was going on politically, on the outside, and that there was all the – there were all these demonstrations.</span> <span id="s339">Then in March – was it February – February, March, that the – the – the one Saturday morning, the negotiations stopped, and the German army marched into Austria, and Austria became part of the German Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Do – do you have a memory of that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Can you describe it to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s344">My parents kept me at home.</span> <span id="s345">We didn’t know what to really expect.</span> <span id="s346">Things on the radio, you know, warned you – there wasn’t any private radio, or the radio was controlled by the government, there was one station.</span> <span id="s347">No TV, of course, and we were told to stay at home.</span> <span id="s348">There were all kinds of warnings given out.</span> <span id="s349">The – I think it must have been on a Saturday, and the German army marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: The warnings were over the radio, or did some friends stop by?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: It’s over the radio, it was over the radio.</span> <span id="s352">And of course, I mean, words traveled in between people, and friends and relatives and – so you heard this really changed from a – it was expected, you know, it wasn’t anything that surprised people, except it shocked everybody.</span> <span id="s353">So, many of my friends went out to the Rykestrasse, it was just a main drag in Vienna in the first district, on which all museums or parliament and the opera, and all the – it’s – it’s where wos – it’s like Champs Elysees in Paris, it’s a six – six or eight or 10, or I think in – avenues, like very wide and dep – so there was a parade there of the German – as the German army marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Were you there with your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No, no, I was at – two weeks later [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Were these – were any of these friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Some were ja – yes, but they were – did not live – what hap – to – one friend that lived next building to us, who was about eight months older than me, or a year older, and the rest of them were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s358">The [indecipherable] friends I had lived next district, in the second district, what a – 18th district, or – or were school friends that did not live where I lived.</span> <span id="s359">So there was one or two Jewish, I think one that I was close to.</span> <span id="s360">I still remember his name, Leo Schickler(ph), and we were kept at home tha-that day.</span> <span id="s361">So, things changed very rapidly.</span> <span id="s362">I was told that our school would stop; Jewish kids would no longer go to school after summer vacation.</span> <span id="s363">I mean, July, we – we were all kicked out.</span> <span id="s364">At – what happened at that particular time, the – the immensity of the political change really did move very fast, but it was not at that to – time, life threatening.</span> <span id="s365">It wasn’t a point that I would get beat up on the street, or would get arrested.</span> <span id="s366">So, what really happened to begin with, that small Jewish businesses, of which there were many in – in Vienna, you know, haberdashery stores, or grocery stores, or what the case may be, all the graffiti was to be painted on their windows, don’t buy here, Juden, it would say, or they would have the star Jew – you know, Star of David painted on the windows, or they would – they would put an SA guy as a Brownshirt, you know, semi-military person in front of the store and discourage people from walking in.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Do you remember what that was like to see one of those graffitis?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s369">It was scary.</span> <span id="s370">The – I could tell you what – what kind of threw me off.</span> <span id="s371">I used to read quite a few books and I belonged to a private library, and so I went to return a book to the library, and want to take out another book, and they told me that I could no longer have a membership there.</span> <span id="s372">And I was startled, and I said why?</span> <span id="s373">Well, he said, you’re Jewish and we cannot any more allow you to be a member here.</span> <span id="s374">I was in – I think of all the things I’ve no longer been able to go to the movie, or to stand on a railroad ca – excuse me, on a streetcar, rather than sitting down, or that – that was long before Jews were forced to wear a Jewish star, you know, on their garments.</span> <span id="s375">We had no identification except everybody wore a swastika in their lapel, except the Jews.</span> <span id="s376">So I was, you know, you’re easily recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Now you say –</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: You were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: You – you say except the Jews.</span> <span id="s380">Did your – did your –</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: You were saying everyone was wearing swastika lapel – o-on their lapel –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes [indecipherable] Jew was – was – and there were different kinds of swastikas, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: – you know, the early Nazis had a number on their swastika emblem, and they had a red – it was red and black, and it was a – with a swastika in the middle, so you knew they were party members, and that there were others.</span> <span id="s386">But everyone wore a swastika except – if I would have been caught wearing a swastika, I don’t know what could have happened.</span> <span id="s387">So Jews didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s388">They were not allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did your parents have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s391">We had some neighbor friends, to – my parents did.</span> <span id="s392">I later found out that they were very helpful to my parents, and I’ll mention that later, because I returned, you know, to Vienna as a soldier.</span> <span id="s393">And then later my mother would say, and she sent me money to give out, American dollars.</span> <span id="s394">I went to – to our old building and I knocked on doors, and I dished out like hundred dollar bills on my visit there, to certain people that Mother – my mother gave me names, who were helpful, who were –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: How far did a hundred dollars go?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: – or 50 dollars, or 20 dollars, but th – she did send me hundred dollar bills, I remember, and she gave me instructions who to give the money to.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: But you were unaware, or you hadn't much –</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I was unaware who – I think it was kept fairly secret, you know, on what help they received.</span> <span id="s399">And because we – there was no – one other Jewish family that lived in our apartment building, who left very early, they were very close friends from my parents.</span> <span id="s400">And another Jewish family which was really half Jewish, where the husband was Jewish, but the wife wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did they leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: And that was the Jewish – and then next building to ours, there lived a Jewish family, and when my father was arrested in November 10th, you know, Kristallnacht, my f – one of my friends lived next building, also was arrested.</span> <span id="s403">And they were arrest – they came to arrest me on November the 10th, and my mother – and came – two storm troopers came to our apartment and wanted to arrest my father and me.</span> <span id="s404">And my mother demonstrated very forcefully that they’re not going to take her son, and had this big argument that took place, and she stood up to them, and they walked out with – after about 30 - 40 minutes of discussion and – and examining our – our apartment, and wanted to know what books I read and they went through my room and pulled out books that they felt were suspect, and there was – I remember that very well, cause it happened very late at night, and it was November the 10th, and they did walk out with my dad arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Now I – I do want to go over the – the night of November ninth to the 10th –</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: – in detail, but I’m – I’m just a little curious still whether, in their social life and be – 1938, and before 1938, do – do you recall whether your parents were mixing with – with non-Jewish people socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Not very much.</span> <span id="s410">So you wouldn’t have had people over to your house –</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: – who were non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Much of our social activity took place at our grandparents, and much of the family met there every, I guess every w-week or second week and – for dinner, and some kind of occasion.</span> <span id="s416">But there wasn’t that kind of, you know, social activity in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Now your grandparents, did they sell the movie house, or did they have to give it up, was it seized?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: I don’t – I think they sold it.</span> <span id="s419">That was long before.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Long before.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yeah, when there were still silent movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Did you – were your grandparents concerned during the year of 1938?</span> <span id="s423">Do you remember their feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes, yes, they were concerned.</span> <span id="s425">They were smuggled out of Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I can’t tell you that when.</span> <span id="s428">That – I’m a little confused about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Do you recall which organization smuggled them?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No, it – yes, I – they were private smugglers, between Germany and Belgium.</span> <span id="s431">And they left Vienna very early after the anschluss, or annexation, and sometimes – it must have been oh, I would guess in August or September of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: They went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s434">Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Did they stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: And – and then came to the United States, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: They did?</span> <span id="s438">When – do you recall when they got to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: I have trouble with that.</span> <span id="s440">I try to think about this, because they – it somehow happened when I was gone, and I don’t know how they got through th – they – and they moved to the Lower East Side in New York City, not far from where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Do you know if this was directly before the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Was this before 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No.</span> <span id="s445">No, it had to be before 19 – that’s what I am confused, because how – I think even happened after 19 – and I don’t see how they got out, because when Hitler started it September 1st, 1939, when the war started, they – you know, they moved across Europe very, very rapidly and took over Belgium, and – you know, and France and every other democracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: And I’m trying to remember how they got – and I – I can’t – I have nothing to refer to, I’ve tried to find – my cousin doesn’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: – how and when they came.</span> <span id="s450">I knew they were in – when I came out of the army, they lived on the Lower East Side in New York City, which was – which was in – what chi – December of 1945 – I’m sorry, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Now th – I-I know I had asked you before, I’m sorry, bi –</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: ’44 - ’45, I don’t remember – ’43 – ’44?</span> <span id="s453">No, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Just the – these were your paternal grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: My maternal grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Maternal.</span> <span id="s457">The one who had the movie theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yes, they lived in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Now what about your paternal grandparents?</span> <span id="s460">Were they still alive in the 30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: My – I didn’t have – I never knew I had a grandmother the other side, she died very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: And we lost complete track of my grandfather and my aunt and an uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: They got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: All right, so let’s get – let’s go ahead then to November ninth to the 10th.</span> <span id="s467">So this was – this was in the evening, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: That was in the evening, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: So wi –</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: We were told not to leave our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s472">And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: And so we stayed.</span> <span id="s474">So it was – it must have been – I cannot recall – I cannot restructure my anxieties or fears, I – I just – I tried, but I can’t.</span> <span id="s475">I do remember exactly what happens.</span> <span id="s476">I could – I can remember what the two SA guys looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: What did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: They were tall, crewcuts, blonde, wore boots, brown shirts, the same brown belt.</span> <span id="s479">A – they had a heavy – they had a coat on, each one of them took it off when they walked in.</span> <span id="s480">And they were overpowering.</span> <span id="s481">I mean, physical al – not physically, I mean, visually.</span> <span id="s482">They were tall –</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Do you know how old they would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: How old would they have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I would say they must have been in the late 20s – middle 20s, late 20s.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And – and clearly these were people you’d never seen before?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah, never seen them before.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: They were very correct, they did not – didn’t touch my mom, they didn’t – they didn’t put – they didn’t put handcuffs on my dad.</span> <span id="s491">They wanted to take me.</span> <span id="s492">They said by – they came to arrest my father and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Do you recall about what time they came to your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes, it was either between 11 - 12 at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Had you already gone to sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: We were – we were – it was – it – you were like under siege, I mean emotionally.</span> <span id="s499">You se – I don’t recall whether we still had our radio or not, they would – confiscated radios from, I think some Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s500">And – or our neighbors were telling – gave – giving us news of what was taking place.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Does that mean that you were on good relations with your neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s503">Was thanks to our – I’ll tell you, as we talk you’ll – I have a couple episodes about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s505">D-Do you recall hearing anything from the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: D-Do you recall hearing anything from the street or from other apartments before th – they men came to your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s509">I think we must have had our radio on because we don’t – we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s510">All schools were closed, all the schools.</span> <span id="s511">And they used them for per – for – for person – not person, for putting in Jewish men [coughs] excuse me – Jewish men into arrest, because they filled up all the prisons.</span> <span id="s512">If there were 240 some odd thousand Jewish families, I would say there must have been a substantial number of Jewish men.</span> <span id="s513">And they didn’t catch everybody.</span> <span id="s514">Whoever was – like my father, we were not very smart sp – staying home, but if he would have been hidden by someone, or gone to a non-Jewish neighbor or friend, they never would have found him.</span> <span id="s515">So, because it was all done, they burned down every synagogue on November the ninth and 10th, and – and then by the 11th and 12, it just – they arrested so many people they had no room, and th – it overwhelmed them.</span> <span id="s516">My father was – we found out that somebody said they saw him carrying out – the field kitchen, helping carry out a big pot, which they fed, at one of the closed schools wher-where we lived, in the same district.</span> <span id="s517">So we rushed over there, and sure enough we saw my dad carry out a big – a – with another man, a big pot, you fill it up with food or soup or whatever it was, from – it was – the field kitchen was on the – you know, on the street, and a lot of people smelling around, watching and trying to find their relatives.</span> <span id="s518">They had heard they was arrested there.</span> <span id="s519">And we waved to him, and that was the last we saw him.</span> <span id="s520">He then, the last we heard was we got a postcard, which was preprinted.</span> <span id="s521">It must be somewheres around, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s522">I hope I kept it.</span> <span id="s523">I don’t know where it is.</span> <span id="s524">My wife and I are going to – through – go through some of our things that are stored away in our basement.</span> <span id="s525">And – and we wave and my – we hollered, and – and we threw kisses, and that was last we saw him.</span> <span id="s526">And next thing we heard was that postcard, preprinted, and all – it was kind of green, I remember.</span> <span id="s527">And it – on it had my father had a very Leon – Leo Lorber with a big, very nicely handwriting.</span> <span id="s528">And the only thing that was there was all preprinted, I’m okay, I’m fine, I’m all this, and all that.</span> <span id="s529">Which every postcard said the same thing, and then his signature, which we recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Did he –</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: So we knew he was alive, and that was from Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Did it give his location, did it say it was Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Now, I – I just want to go back very briefly to the night that your father is arrested.</span> <span id="s535">You said that the – the two men who came were not physically violent?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Did they say –</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: They were very correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did they say why they were taking him, and where they were taking him?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s541">No.</span> <span id="s542">They didn’t say what, he said, we have orders to come to arrest wip – th – every synagogue has been burned down.</span> <span id="s543">Your – it was called the [indecipherable] temple, where we worshipped, not far – well, a few blocks – quite a few blocks from our house.</span> <span id="s544">And – and we’re here to arrest Mr. Lorber, Herr Lorber, and [indecipherable] Fritz Lorber.</span> <span id="s545">They showed that they had a warrant for our arrest.</span> <span id="s546">So, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Okay, so they take him away, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s549">And then you heard what – that the last – next we heard.</span> <span id="s550">He later told me that – this – the most people – it was November, and it was cold, that the – it was a kind of a cold November.</span> <span id="s551">And many people when they got arrested, they didn’t bring warm clothes.</span> <span id="s552">And they put them on these for – what we called 40 and eights.</span> <span id="s553">It’s a – no, it’s a – it’s a – it’s a railroad car, you know, where they transport horses or – or merchandise, you know, not – not a passenger car.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: And they were so crowded, that people stood up.</span> <span id="s556">And they would – they would have that real – that train stopped on [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s557">And it took from Vienna to Munich, where Dachau is located, I don’t know, two days, three days, and it was very cold, and people would defecate – they couldn’t – they wouldn’t let them out of those boxcars – right there.</span> <span id="s558">And many people who were old and fragile, not – I don’t know how many, but some people died on his – where he was standing.</span> <span id="s559">He was less than – you know, you’re born in eight – 1980 – eight nine – ’89 – ’98 – ’98?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s562">I’m getting confused [indecipherable] the numbers.</span> <span id="s563">And – and so he was – this was 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: He was 40 years old.</span> <span id="s566">He was a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: And so he was strong, he was – he was – I’m looking here, I have a picture of him here in my o – I’m sitting in my offi – I have an office in my home, and – and there were people that were 70 - 75 years old, who couldn’t stay, you know, who died, on the short trip –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: In – on the – on the transit.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes, on the transit.</span> <span id="s571">And he said that was very, very terrible.</span> <span id="s572">He would ra – never speak, or try.</span> <span id="s573">Never – I tried to, and he didn’t want to talk about his in – being incarcerated into Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: He never wanted to talk about Dachau itself, or the ride to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No.</span> <span id="s576">The ride, nor about Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Now, the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s579">He told me one thing – no, he didn’t tell me this, I heard it from a relative of ours who was in the same barracks as he was.</span> <span id="s580">My father was very amb – he was a – he was a very hard worker, and very conscientious about what he did.</span> <span id="s581">And this is what I heard; he would never tell me that.</span> <span id="s582">He washed handkerchiefs, he washed rags in – you know, where water was available at night, during the night, for people.</span> <span id="s583">A rag in your pocket was probably the most important possession.</span> <span id="s584">Every morning they – all the prisoners were in mass formation, like six o’clock or 5:30 in the morning, standing out there, you know, by barracks, and they would count them off and make sure that nobody escaped, which was a – which was a lot of bull, but they kept this discipline in this thing.</span> <span id="s585">And as a matter of fact, my friend who was arrested was a year older than me, lived next door to us – I mean, next building to us, Leo Schickler(ph) his name was, also told me his experience, you know, in the morning.</span> <span id="s586">And they would say that barracks number 104 can go to the latrine at 10 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s587">No other time.</span> <span id="s588">And everybody, every barracks was assigned a certain time to go to the bathroom, to relieve themselves.</span> <span id="s589">And there was a lot of dysentery, so people couldn’t control their bodily functions.</span> <span id="s590">And they would have to wait.</span> <span id="s591">So they would, you know, make up and make it in pa – in the pants.</span> <span id="s592">And they needed to have a rag to wipe themselves with.</span> <span id="s593">And that was very important possession.</span> <span id="s594">And then at night, they would – he would help people who we-were incapable of doing it, to wash their rags.</span> <span id="s595">I heard that from another person that – about my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: This was a person who had been incarcerated with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: He did it for a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Did – did you friend Leo Schickler(ph) ever encounter –</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Well, he tells me that story, my friend – this is fore be – before penicillin and we all, including me, always had earaches, very early in – you know, the de – there was no – you just to outgrow something, you – I don’t know why, but we all had earaches when we grew up.</span> <span id="s600">And he was a year older than I, and he was standing in formation at five or six o’clock in the morning, and – and a guard came by, you know, the counting off, and he said anybody – he said, anybody needs to go to the – to see a doctor, what is it, to – to the – what am I thinking of, what word?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Infirmary, hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah, clinic, clinic –</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: – whatever they had, yeah.</span> <span id="s605">And he raised his hand, and he said, what’s wrong – and a guard came over to him, and he says, number – had a number, didn’t call you by name, called you by number.</span> <span id="s606">He says, what’s wrong?</span> <span id="s607">And he says, I have an earache very bad, and I need something, terrible.</span> <span id="s608">He says, which ear, and he show – points to his right ear.</span> <span id="s609">And the guy takes the stock of his rifle and smashes it across his right ear, knocks him unconscious.</span> <span id="s610">He says, now this will help you, ther – it will stop hurting.</span> <span id="s611">It was little things like that –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: And I – I’m assuming Leo survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: And I figured you know, and then – and then the rest of them didn’t want to talk about.</span> <span id="s614">It’s – it – it just seems almost unbelievable that a culture or a – you know, a civilized people would have members in their midst who would carry out these terrible things.</span> <span id="s615">And you know, and particularly Germany that, you know, has a rich history of democracy and civil – and scholarship and education and health care and all the other things that took place in the 18th and 19th century, would – would be able to change a people to these murderers, and unbelievably s – without conscience type of animals.</span> <span id="s616">I mean, they lost all their sense of value, and sense of humanity.</span> <span id="s617">And that always puzzles me.</span> <span id="s618">I’ve had some discussions on that when I talked to some German soldiers, you know, that we – in – that we had in our – we picked up, and – when I was overseas.</span> <span id="s619">All right, so that was – now I will tell you how we got my dad out.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Now hold on, I’m just –</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: – I’m going to pause just for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: One second.</span> <span id="s625">Okay, I’ve un-paused it.</span> <span id="s626">I just asked Fred whether he wanted to take a break, but he is good to go.</span> <span id="s627">And my question is, your friend – your friend Leo, did he survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s630">Then we’ll get back to the story later.</span> <span id="s631">You wanted to talk about how – about your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Well, I don’t quite recall the panic, or the helplessness, cause I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s633">I just tried very hard to try to figure out what did it really feel like.</span> <span id="s634">And what I was really doing.</span> <span id="s635">Well, in the meantime, there were some Jewish organizations and some Americans that came to, or were in Vienna and established some trains, and picked up where the public schools left off.</span> <span id="s636">I was given a choice to – to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s637">So I was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s638">And I was assigned to a Jewish dentist, who could only do – treat Jewish patients, and became his assistant.</span> <span id="s639">I would, you know, mix plaster of Paris and help make false teeth, now, you know, to put people’s – that had problems with their dentures and other things like that, and I would assist this and learn how to give the right instrument to this –</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Was dentistry –</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: And that was a Jewish je – single, young man who was a doctor, and I was assigned to be his assi – learn the trade, as a mit – as a dental mechanic, or whatever it was called, and – because I couldn’t go to school, there was no school for Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: So was dentistry something you could choose amongst other things, or was this assigned as a – a subject?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: It was a big – I have a picture of – someplace, of the sign, his sign on the outside of – of this apartment building.</span> <span id="s644">Big sign, with a Jewish star on it, and it says, you know, it gives his name, being a dentist, and underneath it said, only Jewish patients, he could not treat anybody else.</span> <span id="s645">And I worked for him maybe for – this is a time that my father was gone, and so that must have taken some – some of the hurt and guilt feelings and uncertainties away from me, you know, learning a trade, or learning a profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Was it – was it a choice amongst trades, or were you assigned this trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yes, I think there must have been, and I don’t quite – I don’t remember whether I chose it, or they told me that’s what I have to do, or here’s my chance to do it.</span> <span id="s648">His office was not very far away from where we lived, so I could walk there in the morning, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Do you recall what street it was on?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Do you recall what street it was on?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I – I could point it out to you.</span> <span id="s653">I don’t remember the name of the street, it was on – my – you know, my German is really – it has disappeared quite – quite a bit.</span> <span id="s654">Let me just think.</span> <span id="s655">There is a danuk(ph) – have you ever been in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Yes, but I’m not very good with the topography.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Okay, there is a – a river that runs through the city –</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: – and it’s like the canal, the Danube canal, it’s a – they had – it’s an artificial thing.</span> <span id="s660">It’s not the Danube, the Danube is on the outskirts of Vienna, but it’s in the inner city.</span> <span id="s661">And my – then there is a – between the first and the 20th district, ther – th-tha-that Danube canal runs.</span> <span id="s662">And next to it is a park that runs along the river, with benches and trees.</span> <span id="s663">And my grandparents’ apartment was – it was called the Lände, l-a-n-d-e, with an umlaut – with that umlaut over the A. And his – they – he was about a block away or a few buildings away, the dentist, from where my grandparents had lived, in this very, very nice apartment, on the Lände.</span> <span id="s664">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Speaking of benches, did – do you recall any benches being segregated?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Every bench.</span> <span id="s667">I’ve gotta tell you, because this – about – you asked me.</span> <span id="s668">When I got out of school, gymnasium, there was a park called the Augarten, which is a very large park.</span> <span id="s669">It is part of – was right next to the exit of my gymnasium, and the kids would meet out there after school, and there were benches in that park.</span> <span id="s670">Every bench, in every park in Vienna was immediately, they have stenciled on the back of each one, Juden verboten.</span> <span id="s671">Jews – Jews cannot sit on a bench.</span> <span id="s672">Now, I’ve been in Vienna four or five, maybe six times, and I’ve been riding my bike someti – there’s a bike path that runs from Germany into Vienna and I’ve been on that a few times with my bicycle, and – and some time it occurred to me what I have to do is go to this park where they – every bench said Juden verboten, I would sit on these bench – I sat on eight benches there in a half hour, just to get even with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I think it was about three, four years ago.</span> <span id="s675">And I think people sitting there, looking like I was crazy.</span> <span id="s676">And anyways, I felt I had to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: D-Do you recall any incident when you were – in ’38, when you would be going through this park, perhaps with non-Jewish classmates?</span> <span id="s678">Any kind of sense of you being different?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: D-Do you have any – any story that illustrates that?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: I felt insecure.</span> <span id="s682">I fa – if I see a group of young people, men, you know, boys, travel – who are walking, you know, they’re with four or five, six together.</span> <span id="s683">I would find a – out pretty quick – I was running, I was a – I was on a track team in my gymnasium also.</span> <span id="s684">So I was little – I was somewhat athletic.</span> <span id="s685">And – so I would find someplace that I could disappear, or run, or make sure I don’t cross that path.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: This would have been before or after you were wearing the star?</span> <span id="s687">I’m assuming at one point you had to wear a star.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: There was no star.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: There was no star?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Never.</span> <span id="s691">No, no, we left before the star became law.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Were you running because you felt that they would recognize you?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I would tra – yes, they would – I would be threatened, or I would be beat up, or would had some confrontation, and I tried to avoid that.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Was that because they knew who you were, or was there a way of recognizing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Well, they knew it would – I mean, the first thing is – I should ste – send you a picture, do I look Jewish?</span> <span id="s696">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Well, the question is, did they think you look Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: That’s exactly it.</span> <span id="s699">I didn’t wear a swastika in my lapel, an-and – and I have curly hair, to this very day.</span> <span id="s700">And – and I think that maybe I do look – I don’t know if I look Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s701">I think in the United States I don’t, but I think in Austria I may have.</span> <span id="s702">And you know, I was 14 - 15 years old.</span> <span id="s703">So it –</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Now was there any altercation that actually happened, or did you just –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yeah, I knew it was going to happen, I would get confrontation.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: What would they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: They would, you know, call me names, dirty Jew, or this and that.</span> <span id="s708">And at this time I was very sensitive to that.</span> <span id="s709">I had – I did have a number of non-Jewish friends who were very – who really stuck with me, very early in the game.</span> <span id="s710">And I – when I went with them, was no problem.</span> <span id="s711">But my mother was not very happy that I would go to places I shouldn’t be.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: What kind of places?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Well, I wasn’t allowed to go to a movie, and I did sneak in a few times.</span> <span id="s714">I-I think there are certain places that – where Jews were not allowed, a park.</span> <span id="s715">I did not sick on a park – I did not sit on a park bench until that episode I mentioned.</span> <span id="s716">And I was very sensitive and really very careful on how – what my behavior was, and that almost any time I walked or went someplace, I was very, very – I knew I was very vulnerable, and I was very careful about doing things.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: This heightened sense of vulnerability, did this only, well, grow after Kristallnacht, or where you already quite sensitive before?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Well, how do I – okay, there was a famous Jewish – that’s not – I’m sorry, famous German author called Karl May.</span> <span id="s719">Ever hear of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: He wrote 64 books, each one four, five, 600 pages, I’ve – I think I read every one of them.</span> <span id="s722">And he wrote about America and about the Indians and the trappers and the west – the American west, the – he had heroes like Winnetou and Old Shatterhand –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Yes, I am – I am familiar with those books.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s725">I read every one of the books.</span> <span id="s726">And it – he really – and the guy never left Germany.</span> <span id="s727">He – all out of his head.</span> <span id="s728">As a matter of fact, two of my friends and I, we decided to revisit some of our last – was it two years ago, we went to Paris and Berlin and – and Vienna, and doing kind of some spots from the second World War, and they’re both veterans.</span> <span id="s729">And we stopped in Berlin for a week, and they had an ex – they had a special exhibition at one of the museums, the city museum of Berlin, of Karl May.</span> <span id="s730">He was a faker, you know, but he wrote the books that to this very day are very popular, a hundred years later, still very popular in Germany.</span> <span id="s731">It’s all about America, the American west, Indians and trappers and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s732">So I was big fan of that.</span> <span id="s733">As a matter of fact, once one of my teachers asked my mom to come to school because te – she felt I was reading too many of those books.</span> <span id="s734">So I had that little adventure seed planted into me.</span> <span id="s735">So it became a game to me a little bit, of avoiding being – you know, meeting someone that – with whom I would have a confrontation.</span> <span id="s736">And having – and living in an area which there were mostly non-Jews.</span> <span id="s737">I was used to that, and the people were somewhat protective of us wher-where we lived.</span> <span id="s738">I don’t ever remember being threatened or – except that one thing of our cleaning lady coming and then demanding money from my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Was this before or after –</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: And our neighbors – our neighbors were very, very – they didn’t go out of their way, they didn’t ou – they didn’t violate any of the Nazi laws, but they were protective of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: The cleaning lady who came to demand money, this was before or after they took away your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I have to think about that.</span> <span id="s743">I think it was after they took my father away.</span> <span id="s744">[indecipherable] that my mother was – she was very strong, she was really determined.</span> <span id="s745">And she – we got my – I got – we got my dad out of –</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: What – I – and I want to talk about that, about – but one question.</span> <span id="s749">Be-Because it was your mother who stopped the – the officers from taking you away on Kristallnacht, did her attitude change about safety, especially your safety in the months after Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s750">Was she particularly concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I think she very – she became very careful, and very sensitive to what was going on and wan-wanted to make certain that I don’t make any waves, or to open up my mouth and say the wrong things.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Di-Did she say something specifically?</span> <span id="s753">What not to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: And you were talking about –</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: I don’t – I think it’s primarily the environment she created, probably more than anything else.</span> <span id="s757">She was a gutsy lady, she was very smart.</span> <span id="s758">And not because she was my mom, and I’ll – it’ll come as I tell you my story, but she – she had her – her feet on the ground almost all the time.</span> <span id="s759">She never panicked.</span> <span id="s760">And there was plenty of opportunities to panic.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: You were talking ab-about trying to get out of the way of – of young men on the street –</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: – but that you felt relatively safe when you were walking with non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s764">Do you recall whether these friends perhaps were wearing any swastikas on their lapel?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes, they all did.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: They all did?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: How did they reconcile that with the fact that you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s769">Was this ever a – a conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: That’s my phone, so don’t worry about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Oh, you’re free to – to get that, should I – should I pause?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No, then I’ll lose you.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: No, you won’t lose me.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Yeah, they’ll call, I’ll leave a message.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Ah, 11 o’clock here.</span> <span id="s777">Give me your question again?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Well, the question was, you – you were feeling relatively safe walking –</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: I don’t quite say [indecipherable] I think they all wore swastikas, I can’t swear on that.</span> <span id="s780">But I think that was the – that was the law.</span> <span id="s781">That was to be able to – to – to survive, to be – you know, the whole country took on an entire different look.</span> <span id="s782">Go and see that film that – that is – you have in your library, about Vienna.</span> <span id="s783">It’s a 10 minute film – if I have it handy here – no, it’s – it’s someplace here in my office.</span> <span id="s784">And, I could look at it.</span> <span id="s785">And you have it.</span> <span id="s786">And it shows you the enthusiasm, and the – this is in March of 19 – or April second of 1938 when Hitler first comes back into Vienna and – and the whole town goes berserk.</span> <span id="s787">So you have this – the ab – the unbelievable propaganda machine working with such efficiency and dedication to turn the whole culture around.</span> <span id="s788">This was the ability that they were able to do.</span> <span id="s789">I mean, if you go – you were in an environment where you see all the shoes and all the luggage and all the boxcars and – in your mu – in the museum.</span> <span id="s790">And you say, how do the civilized and – civilized people do that?</span> <span id="s791">And here’s a guy, you know, here’s that – that – that believe this – this unbelievable corruption of morality and ethics and humanity and everything that we have been taught to believe in as we live on this earth, go to pot.</span> <span id="s792">So you see that tremendous change that takes place within people that just – to this very day I don’t quite understand it, how a normal, civilized people go and kill people, or put them into a gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: The f – the friends that you were with when you were walking outside, did they change during those months in ’38?</span> <span id="s794">Did –</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yes, they did, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Do-Do – do you recall –</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: But you see, you – you – here’s what happens.</span> <span id="s798">Yeah, I – you know, I’m an anti-Semite, but you are my – you’re – you’re my Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s799">I am – I’m an anti-Semite, but you’re my buddy, and I’m not – I’m not against you.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Did –</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Though there’s always this emotional exception that people make.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Did – did any one of them actually say something like that to you, or was it a sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: I don’t remember, I don’t remember any of the conversations, because these instances of me walking with them, or talking to my friends, or the ones I went to school with, the – the – the occurrence of that were overco – you know, were really – became minor.</span> <span id="s804">The – the major things that – that one was thinking about was well, how do we get out of here?</span> <span id="s805">What do we do, what’s the future?</span> <span id="s806">How do I get my father out of Dachau, what has to be done, you know, how are we – what’s our future going to be?</span> <span id="s807">I can’t go to school any more, or I’m now working for a dentist, or – so he – your values system takes a dive, and all the things you’ve been taught just absolutely disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Do you know why your parents didn’t choose to emigrate when your grandparents emigrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Well, that was going over the – because we had applied very early, my – either my dad or my mom went to the American embassy and put our name on the list.</span> <span id="s810">And then we received an affidavit from relative of ours, that lived in Cincinnati, whom I never met, who sent us an affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: 1930 – must have been in 1930 – the end of ’37, or to be – or the first month in – or January 1938 that they went to the American embassy and they said well, you have – you put your name here, on the list, because there’s a waiting list that once you get your affidavit, before, we going to issue visas depending upon when your name appeared on this list.</span> <span id="s813">So that name didn’t appear on this list until November 1939.</span> <span id="s814">That’s our names.</span> <span id="s815">And that was – it had to be very early, before the Nazi takeover of Austria.</span> <span id="s816">But they’ve –</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Be-Before the takeover in ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: – they o – o – they only issued 24,000 visas in that time, between people from Germany and Austria, born in Germany and Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: So your – your parents put their names on the list –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: – in, let’s say, January of ’38, or perhaps in the last months of ’37, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: And then did you say that your names actually came up on the roster for – for these visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: It didn’t show up –</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Until Novemb –</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: – our visa – our affidavit came very early from our relatives in Cincinnati, and with – that was filed with the American embassy, and then we had to wait until our name was – appeared on that list when, you know, and that didn’t happen until November of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: And at that point your father was already incarcerated.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: My father was very – we got him out of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Okay, so then let’s – let’s talk about that, how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s831">I ran – I was walking on the street one day by myself and I ran into a really good friend of mine that I had not seen, he’s non-Jewish, was in my class for four years in gymnasium, had not seen since the Nazi takeover.</span> <span id="s832">They lived quite a ways away.</span> <span id="s833">And were so surprised to see each other.</span> <span id="s834">And he wanted to know what – what was going on, how we were doing, and what was happening.</span> <span id="s835">And I told him about our situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Hold on, I just – I just want to –</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: – understand something.</span> <span id="s839">You say you haven’t seen him since the Nazi takeover.</span> <span id="s840">That was January, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: I what – that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: That was January, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: What, when I met my friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: No, no, no, what – th-the Nazi – the anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: The anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: The anschluss take place – took place in March of 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Yeah, in March, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: – March of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: But you were still in school until May.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: June.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: June.</span> <span id="s853">And had you –</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: And – and had you – this was a classmate, so had you been in school with him through June, or is that an –</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No, no, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s857">I hadn't seen him since the end – since July 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s859">All right, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: So I ran into him a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: A year later, okay.</span> <span id="s862">So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Or something like that, you know.</span> <span id="s864">June – had to be June or July.</span> <span id="s865">And he asked me what was going on, and I started crying, telling him about my dad, we don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s866">And he listened very patiently, and I never will forget him.</span> <span id="s867">And he said to me, you know, I have an – my uncle is a sturm(ph) something.</span> <span id="s868">Obersturmgon(ph) something fuehrer in the SA.</span> <span id="s869">That’s before they got rid of the Brownshirts, there were the SS and the SA, they were kind of semi-military.</span> <span id="s870">They got rid of some of them, but I think this guy was a very high up in – he says, I should go and come – he’s gonna see his uncle, and I should go, my mother and I should come and visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Do you remember your friend’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: No.</span> <span id="s873">Terrible, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: No, I’m not –</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: I should have re –</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: – I should have written all these things down, or what –</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: But all these things happened, you know, so fast.</span> <span id="s880">I don’t remember very – you know, I remember the things that happened, but don’t ask me for details.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Cause I – somehow my mind doesn’t click that way.</span> <span id="s883">And I was really bad about stre – cause, you know, I was back in Vienna, looking up people.</span> <span id="s884">But anyways, my mom and I went to see his uncle.</span> <span id="s885">He had a travel agency.</span> <span id="s886">And he said, there are ways to get out of – of Austria to go to – I think I mentioned that, to go to China, to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s887">And he fou – and he sold some tickets to some Jewish people.</span> <span id="s888">And [indecipherable] the whole thing, it’s just my mother, you know, were talking.</span> <span id="s889">And I said to her, listen to this, and when she tells him that we can’t leave, because my father is in Dachau, and we’re not gonna leave and leave my father in Dachau.</span> <span id="s890">And he said, oh.</span> <span id="s891">He says he’s gonna find out who has responsibilities, or who is involved with Dachau.</span> <span id="s892">And he was pretty high up in the es – this hierarchy, the Brownshirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: And you don’t remember his name, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Beg your pardon – I don’t know – remember his name at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Ye – ye – okay, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: I just remember what he looked like.</span> <span id="s897">And you come back to this – we met at his office, and my friend was there, and his father, who was a brother to this big shot in the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s898">Now, to be a big shot in the Nazi party, you had to be an – a member of the Nazi party for a long time, during the time that it was illegal.</span> <span id="s899">So this guy must have been – for many years been a Nazi, which doesn’t sit very pleasant with us – pleasantly.</span> <span id="s900">So we came back, I think a week or two later, and he found out that if we could go to that – he found out who has responsibility of the Dachau inmates that were arrested in Vienna, and it’s an SS officer that has a desk at the Metropole Hotel in first district on Rudolfsplatz(ph) and he was going to make an appointment with – for my mother to meet this officer, and find out what has to be done, if we could get my father out of camp.</span> <span id="s901">He said to us that we, I think, have to show proof that we would leave within a very short time.</span> <span id="s902">So where would we go?</span> <span id="s903">You know, Europe at that time, almost every border was closed.</span> <span id="s904">My mother had an ex – old boyfriend who was English Jewish person, that she was, I think seeing romantically, or just a good friend, before she married.</span> <span id="s905">And he was a British officer by this time, Jewish fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: No.</span> <span id="s908">I should.</span> <span id="s909">Some are –</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: No.</span> <span id="s911">It’s not a value judgment, I’m just curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yeah, I – they’ll be someplace.</span> <span id="s913">I may have to think up these things in my documents that I haven’t had the energy to kind of go my – down the basement and start – we’re getting rid of things, you know, and not fast enough.</span> <span id="s914">So, we didn’t – I mean, that – that developed itself later in Israel, but so he made an appointment with – for my mother to see this guy at the – at the headquarters of the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Why did this man help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Why did this man help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Because he was an uncle to my friend that I went to school with.</span> <span id="s919">The – remember I met him on the street –</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: – and he brought me to his uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: I’m – I’m – I’m asking this kind of bald-faced question because I’m –</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: I also think – know that there was some money passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: We are – he sold – I – I’m not sure about this, and I can’t really pr – take – swore on it, but I think that my mother bought three tickets on a boat to go to China from him; he had – he owned a travel agency.</span> <span id="s926">So – and I’m not sure about it, but I think this has something to do with it.</span> <span id="s927">So all this conversation took place, and appointments were made and – now let’s see, what did I forget?</span> <span id="s928">And there was a question about getting a visa that was – visas sold illegally by a embass – a Chinese embassy official who – who wasn’t supposed to do it, but sold permits to go to Shanghai from Vienna, and also, it was done out of Germany.</span> <span id="s929">So that’s, you know, a number of people, Jewish people landed up in Shanghai, and later found out they were – they – they sold those to make money, and it was not a policy of the Chinese government.</span> <span id="s930">But the – they did s-save a number of Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Now, i-if I –</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I know two of them here, that lived in Des Moines.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: If I understand correctly, this was – this was probably costing quite a little bit.</span> <span id="s934">During – and – and – and given that your father was incarcerated, and he had, I – I’m supposing, lost his job earlier, were there any financial difficulties during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: For us?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: I don’t think so, because my mother still was dishing out money to people who had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Was this through any organization, any charitable organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: It was kind of a unofficial done, you know, that things happened when – when panic strikes, that people find ways of doing things.</span> <span id="s940">It was not official.</span> <span id="s941">I don’t think it was an organization like HIAS or anything like that.</span> <span id="s942">Be – was that somebody had re – a relative in – in New York, and – who had money, or was willing to help this person living in Vienna who had no money.</span> <span id="s943">So they would say if – if the official exchange of marks – used to be shillings and then it became German marks, was five marks to the d – 10 marks to the dollar – I’ve forgotten what the exchange rate was, the black market would pay 20 marks to a person in – in Vienna, instead of 10.</span> <span id="s944">So it paid for the relative to deal to that black market, or whatever it was called, to that conduit.</span> <span id="s945">And so if you had money and you lived in Vienna, and you – there were Jewish people who had no money, and they need to buy groceries.</span> <span id="s946">And they had relatives that would give – who would contribute some money.</span> <span id="s947">So that’s why I think – where the money flow went, back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: So you – you’re – you’re suspecting that perhaps there were some family members in the United States that were helping?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Not much – some stuck and some didn’t.</span> <span id="s952">So it’s – our parents lost quite a bit of – my parents lost quite a bit of money in the transactions, I guess.</span> <span id="s953">So, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: So the – the uncle of your friend –</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: – made an appointment for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Oh, she made appointment, and he sold three sh – steamship tickets, so that’s how he made money, to my mother to go to China, once my dad was – and then we had to get a visa from a Chinese embassy, and I don’t know if that was done or not.</span> <span id="s958">It was almost a way of, you know, paying off the guy.</span> <span id="s959">So she went through the Hotel Metropole.</span> <span id="s960">I went with her, but I stayed outside, I remember that.</span> <span id="s961">And there was a big line-up outside of people waiting.</span> <span id="s962">They had people in – in prison and tortured at that building, down in the basement.</span> <span id="s963">The building, last time I was in Vienna it no longer existed, but they did put a monument there, just historically, what – that the Gestapo headquarters was there.</span> <span id="s964">And my mom was ushered in, after waiting in line for a couple hours or more, and she always described this, she was very – she had a wonderful memory, and one of – my lawyer here in town is a fellow named David Bellon(ph) [indecipherable] he was also on the Warren Commission, and very – became very prominent nationally, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s965">Unfortunately, he died, but was also a close friend of mine.</span> <span id="s966">And he heard my mother’s story and – and he wanted to record – record that part where she told the details of her visit at the Gestapo, with the black uniform, and the heil Hitlers and the – and everybody was throwing out their arm, and you know, heil Hitler, and it – and clicking their heels, and she went to – so finally met the guy, and the guy interviewed for about two hours, and then asked her to come back, she came – we went back, same old thing and he said to her, he would release my father.</span> <span id="s967">There was no money exchanged at all, and it was on the – really on the push of my friend’s uncle, who was a friend of this Gestapo guy.</span> <span id="s968">And he would come out in about two weeks, three weeks.</span> <span id="s969">And he – she has to bring him to meet – to meet – he wanted to meet my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: The –</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Mother – my mother said –</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: The uncle of your friend, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yeah – no, the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: The Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s976">And she says to Gestapo officer, why do you want to meet my husband?</span> <span id="s977">He sees enough of black uniforms in Dachau.</span> <span id="s978">And he – he said, I want to know what kind of a man marries such a woman like you.</span> <span id="s979">So she always told that story, what the Gestapo officer – you know, she was a gutsy lady and she was very articulate and was able to convince this guy.</span> <span id="s980">So, sure enough, my dad come out –</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: What month is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: It had to be, I would guess July, August, maybe later, September.</span> <span id="s983">I can’t remember, I have to go really –</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: But we’re in 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: – and find – I have papers like that, it was sometimes in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: But this was before the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: The war started September first.</span> <span id="s990">And he was really – I don’t think he was ever the same.</span> <span id="s991">He never wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s992">He had – never wanted to go on vacation, he never wanted – he wanted to work.</span> <span id="s993">He had guilt feelings, survivor’s kind of why was he had the privilege of getting out of Dachau, and other people died there.</span> <span id="s994">That bothered him a great, great deal.</span> <span id="s995">So he had these – which was not uncommon type of guilt feelings, of been able to have got out, wh-when he – people that he knew never made it out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: But he never talked about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah, but at that time – as a matter of fact, one of my other closest friend that I went to school with, to – Jewish – his father was the concertmaster for the Des Moines – excuse me, I’m si – Des Moines, but the Vienna Philharmonic and also a professor of vi – violin, you see, well-known violinist.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yes, Geringer, Josef – you – Josef Geringer then became concertmaster at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.</span> <span id="s1000">Hake – he was in there with my dad.</span> <span id="s1001">And Irving was one of my very closest friends, he went to si – he was one class – he was one class higher in the same gymnasium I went to, and his brother was in my class, I think [indecipherable] two classes or one class, I don’t quite remember.</span> <span id="s1002">And he – I’m just gonna give you a sideline.</span> <span id="s1003">I was taking basic – infantry basic training in Camp Croft in 1943.</span> <span id="s1004">And I was assigned to a group of people they didn’t know what to do with.</span> <span id="s1005">I think our I.Q. had something to do with it, and not being a citizen, I was just in this country four years, and I was in there with people that were much smarter than me, that – some of them older, substantial, were all born not in the United States.</span> <span id="s1006">And people in the music business who escaped out of Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s1007">Zero Mostel was in my barracks, you remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1012">And so I’m sitting outside one day after whatever training I went through that day, and I became an infantry – I became a machine gun – what the – rifleman and machine gun.</span> <span id="s1013">That was my spec.</span> <span id="s1014">I see this guy looks familiar walking across the common and I recognize, oh my God, that’s Irving Geringer.</span> <span id="s1015">I si – hollered at him, Irving, Irving, is that you?</span> <span id="s1016">Sure enough he turns around, it’s him.</span> <span id="s1017">He – he was a brilliant guy; I think his I.Q. must have been 160 or so, and they put him as the historical section for the Fifth Army.</span> <span id="s1018">So we landed – we move – when we are shipped overseas into North Africa and then into Italy, he also got shipped over, and he ran the historic section for the Fifth Army, so he wrote a book about the campaign.</span> <span id="s1019">So everywhere I was, he showed up.</span> <span id="s1020">He had that freedom.</span> <span id="s1021">And we were almost inseparable during our army days.</span> <span id="s1022">No matter where we went, he always found me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: An-And you have said that Irving had been incarcerated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Irving, unfortunately he died.</span> <span id="s1025">He later became editor of the “Saturday Review of Literature,” and his father was the concertmaster for the orchestra at the Metropolitan Opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: And had they both been incarcerated in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: No, no, no, just his dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Just his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Did – ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: And when they – they lur – moved – I don’t know if you know much about New York City, but when they came to the United States, he immediately, you know, he was well-known; didn’t have a pr – his father.</span> <span id="s1032">And they lived on Gramercy Park, which is like 23rd Street and Fifth Ave. – 23rd – Second Avenue in New York City.</span> <span id="s1033">And I spent a lot of time with them when I came out of the army.</span> <span id="s1034">He had a sister who lives in Washington, and I think a brother in Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s1035">He died, unfortunately, my friend.</span> <span id="s1036">And he wrote the book about the campaign in Italy.</span> <span id="s1037">So, the – and his dad – well, why do I mention it?</span> <span id="s1038">Because his dad also was arrested and was – spent time, and they got him out also.</span> <span id="s1039">Somebody in the music business, and famous within the – in the ar – with the – I think with the administration that time, the [indecipherable] administration in Vienna, because he was well-known as a musician, you know, and the executive – okay, where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Well, you said that your father then had been incarcerated for about 10 months, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: This would have been early November through the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Was there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Or maybe 10 – nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Nine, 10 months.</span> <span id="s1047">Was there any communication from him, aside from that one postcard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: There wa – there was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Was there any communication with him aside from that one postcard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: No.</span> <span id="s1051">There was po – a repetition of the postcards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: How frequently, how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: That I can’t reve – I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1054">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Okay, then let’s go back to – to th-the – the chronology of the story.</span> <span id="s1056">So this Gestapo man told your mother that he would like to see her husband once he is out, and then – then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1058">Well, then we received – now, I think it was afore we received that we’re supposed to go to China.</span> <span id="s1059">And we received a police permit to – and I don’t know was four weeks or six weeks to prepare us to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: But did they release your father immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Did they release your father immediately?</span> <span id="s1063">How –</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Yeah, yeah, my father came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Was it only a few days between the meeting, or weeks, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: A few days between – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Between your mother’s meeting with the Gestapo officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1071">Well, he came out.</span> <span id="s1072">It took several weeks, I think, or – maybe several weeks, maybe two weeks for my father to – to come out from Dachau.</span> <span id="s1073">And she took him up to meet that officer.</span> <span id="s1074">So she made three visits to this SS guy at the Metropole Hotel.</span> <span id="s1075">And we received – we told – we were told that we had to leave within four weeks.</span> <span id="s1076">And we had those steamship tickets and permits to go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1077">We didn’t want to go to Shanghai – it’s just not me, but my parents.</span> <span id="s1078">And she – my father went every four weeks to get an extension of this permit to stay.</span> <span id="s1079">Waiting for – my mother knew – pretty much guessed when we possibly – our visa number would come up to go to United States.</span> <span id="s1080">So we didn’t use those tickets to – steamship tickets.</span> <span id="s1081">I don’t think we did anything with it.</span> <span id="s1082">I’m not sure whether we bought them or didn’t buy them, and I u – I-I just can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1083">I wish my mother were alive, and she would probably really tell the story much better than I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: You’re telling it very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: [indecipherable] pretty – pretty much out of – you’re out of – you know, out of si – you know, she – there was a lot of things happening that I – you know, 15 years old, I didn’t – I was a little bit out of sync.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: And so we – we lived from month to month, getting a permit from the police department, and – which I remember the police department, or the police station, because I went back there as a soldier, I looked them up.</span> <span id="s1088">And it was until – we stayed there – the war started September first, and we’re still in Vienna, and things got to be worse.</span> <span id="s1089">I think they began to issue us permits to buy food.</span> <span id="s1090">Now what would I call it, I forgot now, I can’t get – put my name on it.</span> <span id="s1091">Oh, ration cards.</span> <span id="s1092">And so – oh, and we got an order to – we must leave our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: It had to be in September or October.</span> <span id="s1095">Things were really heating up, they ge-getting worse.</span> <span id="s1096">The Nazi takeover of Jewish businesses was going on and – much, much more ra-rapidly.</span> <span id="s1097">Less and less Jewish business existed, you know, with graffiti on their windows, they were all taken over.</span> <span id="s1098">People lost their fortunes.</span> <span id="s1099">Rich people were able to get out very early, the Rothschilds, and whoever they all – the other people were, the Blochs(ph) and so on.</span> <span id="s1100">And they took over their palaces and their facilities and confiscated most of their wealth and paintings, and I – really got tough.</span> <span id="s1101">And in the meantime my dad would go out to the police, get an extension.</span> <span id="s1102">And we would go pretty often to – not I, but mom and dad – to the American embassy to find out where we were on that list.</span> <span id="s1103">It looked more and more that we had a chance to really go to America.</span> <span id="s1104">And finally, our visa came – not visa, but our number came up, and we were able to get the visa in November to departure in that wa – I think it came up in October, for us to leave in November.</span> <span id="s1105">We packed up one container with personal things.</span> <span id="s1106">I took my three-speed bike, my so-soccer ball, and my skis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: And this was already from another location, cause you had to – had to leave your home, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Yes, everything – oh, yes, we were moved out to where we li – from our apartment, somebody else took it over, a Nazi member.</span> <span id="s1109">And we moved –</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Was there any compensation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: – in with – yes, into a – which they had planned to make it a ghetto in second district, and we moved in – now I don’t quite remember, I think one family or two families which – whom we – Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1112">And one of the families – so everybody had a bedroom, we shared a living room and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s1113">And one of them, I found out with the lady, because she was beautiful, and she was an actress, with her husband with her.</span> <span id="s1114">And she was a – on the cover of “Die Bühne,” the stage, a famous theatrical magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: No.</span> <span id="s1117">I wish I did.</span> <span id="s1118">You know, it’s so – as I look back, our – psychologically and – and I would guess no matter what, it was so important that our lives, you know, were at constant danger.</span> <span id="s1119">And si – never did I ever have the desire to start – we put together – some people did, I just didn’t, and my parents did – didn’t.</span> <span id="s1120">We want to get rid of this whole history, and we should have really kept so many things that would have been very valuable today, to create my story.</span> <span id="s1121">And it really – I just want to get out, and the less I had – I was more interested in my soccer ball and my bicycle and my skis than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Now it – it’s interesting that your – your – describing this as –</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: We had one – they let us take out one container.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: You’re describing this as a – as a – as a period where the priority was to get out.</span> <span id="s1127">But it’s interesting to me that you’re saying that your parents pretty much turned down the opportunity to go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1128">So it was – they wanted to get out, but it was still a priority to get out –</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: – to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: But you know, nobody knew what was going to ha – nobody could have imagined, or perceived the – what the Nazis were going to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: It wa – it just – you know, your mind did not grasp the evil, or grasp this – these people would have gas chambers and put thousands of people to death.</span> <span id="s1134">It – your mind and your culture and your upbringing did not perceive that kind of crime.</span> <span id="s1135">It was just not – it – it – it just couldn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Was your fam –</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Until it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Was your family offered any kind of monetary compensation for the seizure of the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1140">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1141">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: So you had to – you had to move into this other location.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Can you tell me again where that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Second district, Leopold str – Leopold something.</span> <span id="s1146">Leopoldsdorf(ph)?</span> <span id="s1147">Second dist – there are 21 districts in Vienna, this was the second district, not far from where we lived before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1149">And – and you had to share this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Was not very far from where my an – aunt and uncle lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: And you had to share these quarters with two other families, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah, that was their plan, to build a ghetto in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: And how long – how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Not very long.</span> <span id="s1155">Two months?</span> <span id="s1156">A month, six weeks.</span> <span id="s1157">And I’m guessing at the time frame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: And then we got – the visas showed up, and we packed a – we got a – a shipping agent company that would ship our stuff out.</span> <span id="s1160">And what – they let us take one container out, a big container.</span> <span id="s1161">And that’s what I put my stuff in, and some of my parents’ dishes, and whatever they – you know, they felt was valuable, and – to start a new life.</span> <span id="s1162">And we left – I – it had to be the first week in November, 1939.</span> <span id="s1163">The war started September first, so the Nazis or the Germans, Austrians were happy with all the conquests they were making at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1164">So they didn’t have time for us at that si – I don’t think, to worry about what we took out, or who we were.</span> <span id="s1165">They were – they were glorifying themselves and you know, they were chasing the British through the English channel, to Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s1166">And taken over at that time Belgium and – and Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: So how – I – can you – can you tell me a bit how you got out of Austria and Germany, did you take a train first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yes, we took a train to Trieste.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: And we took a ship, was a luxury ship called Saturnia, was an Italian ship.</span> <span id="s1171">It was all lit up because of all the U-boats.</span> <span id="s1172">And Italy at that time was not in the war.</span> <span id="s1173">It declared – they went on the side of Germany, I think, three or four months later, or whatever it was, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1174">And we went on this very beautiful ship, I – it was very luxurious, except that they put – I stayed with my dad in a cabin, and my mom was with other women.</span> <span id="s1175">And there were – there are other, one or two other women, and they overburdened the ship.</span> <span id="s1176">In other words, to try to put the – put as many people on it as they could, many of whom were refugees like us.</span> <span id="s1177">And we landed in New York in November, I don’t remember the date.</span> <span id="s1178">And my – our relatives were at the dock.</span> <span id="s1179">I never forgotten, never, that in – I was always thankful that the ship did not dock.</span> <span id="s1180">It stayed outside the harbor in New York City.</span> <span id="s1181">And Europe at that time was in [indecipherable] blacked out.</span> <span id="s1182">Couldn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s1183">There were no lights at night.</span> <span id="s1184">Cars had no headlights, they had slits on their headlights, and it was – there were no public, no streetlights, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1185">The war was on, they were always afraid of bombings, so every light at night at – wherever it was, whether it was Berlin or Vienna or anyplace else, were totally, totally blacked out.</span> <span id="s1186">And a ship docked, came there in the evening of whatever that date was in November, and it docked on the other side that later became the Verrazano bridge.</span> <span id="s1187">And you saw the tip of Manhattan, the skyscrapers or the tip, the Woolworth buildings and – all lit up.</span> <span id="s1188">It was totally disbelief.</span> <span id="s1189">I stood out there on the dock and it was cold, and seeing New York City all lit up; it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1190">And next morning we passed the Statue of Liberty, I shall never forget that.</span> <span id="s1191">It was the most glorifying day of my life, and I became an American overnight, emotionally, at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1192">I – so we landed in New York, and we moved in with our friends who were – lived in the same building in Vienna, who got and had many relatives, cousins and brothers and sisters lived in New York.</span> <span id="s1193">And Schultzenberg(ph) the name was, in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1194">We lived with them for about a month or two, and I think maybe six weeks.</span> <span id="s1195">I immediately went into high school.</span> <span id="s1196">I went to boys – in Brooklyn, there was boys’ school called – what was it called?</span> <span id="s1197">He – Alexander Hamilton High.</span> <span id="s1198">And I think – I don’t quite remember if I went in as a sophomore, I think, or as junior.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Now, you didn’t speak any English before you arrived, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s1201">I took two years of English in gymnasium, but my – th-the most complicated book I read was “My Bonnie Flies Over the Ocean.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Was that a book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yes, was a book, a children’s book.</span> <span id="s1204">And – and really my English was no, no – unbelievably limited, and I was, as I – I never forget, they introduced in in assembly at – at the Alexander Hamilton High, who – which was later – now it’s called Paul Robeson High.</span> <span id="s1205">And at – at the – in the auditorium, on the stage, I think I wore knickers.</span> <span id="s1206">And they’d never seen somebody like me.</span> <span id="s1207">And I had a teacher, a English teacher I shall never forget, Miss Rossman(ph), who stayed with me after school, taught me how to pronounce the Hs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: The Hs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Yeah, the Hs.</span> <span id="s1210">The.</span> <span id="s1211">It is a foreign sound in German.</span> <span id="s1212">And also, I was determined to be an American.</span> <span id="s1213">Three – I went there for just one term, and then my parents got an apartment on the Lower East Side of New York.</span> <span id="s1214">My father started – took the [indecipherable] my mom took two – two – do you know anything about New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: A little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: A little, okay.</span> <span id="s1217">So we were – got an apartment.</span> <span id="s1218">And I don’t remember the name of the – I – I va – I think I’ll think of the name of the street.</span> <span id="s1219">And my dad decided he’s – we need to make money, we need to make a living, we need to be in business, so we need to do something.</span> <span id="s1220">We don’t want to depend upon anybody, this is no unemployment, this was nothing.</span> <span id="s1221">We had no ways of getting any help from anyone.</span> <span id="s1222">And what little money they – we were able to transport out at these exchanges, you know, that took place over a couple of years, so we had some money in a bank account.</span> <span id="s1223">He went to Orchard Street which is kind of – used to be a wholesale places, it’s right, but now it’s kind of a san – it’s kind of a bargain street in new ye – in the Lower East Side of New York, and they found a wholesaler of socks, men’s socks, and he filled up a suitcase, my parents [indecipherable] black and brown and white and by men’s socks, on one suitcase.</span> <span id="s1224">And then my dad found sections in New York, the Lower East Side where people spoke either German or Yiddish, and could understand him.</span> <span id="s1225">And he knocked on doors and he peddled.</span> <span id="s1226">And he never came home until – until the suitcase was empty.</span> <span id="s1227">And peddled those socks.</span> <span id="s1228">He would ask him, do s – you know, yeveten(ph) Yiddish, you can speak Yiddish, as he knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s1229">Most people could, you know, a lot of Jewish sections in the Lower East Side of New York.</span> <span id="s1230">A lot of places in Brooklyn, and he would sell those socks.</span> <span id="s1231">And then, first money they were able to accumulate, they opened up a little grocery store on East Church Street at Avenue C.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Had to be 1940 – 40.</span> <span id="s1234">I went – transferred to Seward Park High School, and I had a cousin there, my mother’s brother, who had – they lived in United States for long time, and she grew up.</span> <span id="s1235">And my cousin at that time is a freshman at CCNY, City College.</span> <span id="s1236">And he introduced me to all his friends: girlfriends and boyfriends and students and freshmen, and that’s how I learned.</span> <span id="s1237">They took me in like I was their brother.</span> <span id="s1238">And I went to Seward Park High School, and I finished high school in a couple of years, went to CCNY.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Was this a mixed group of friends, Jews, non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yes, they were all Jewish, they were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: They were all Jewish, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: All Jews.</span> <span id="s1243">Yeah, they lived on the Lower East Side.</span> <span id="s1244">We used to hang out in back of a place called Hamilton Fish Library, and they were bright, they were undemanding, totally unprejudiced.</span> <span id="s1245">I learned English very rapidly.</span> <span id="s1246">I did well in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Did you ever have to use your German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: No.</span> <span id="s1249">I got rid of ger – I lost my German, totally.</span> <span id="s1250">I mean, I spoke it a little bit, but I – I could probably speak it again, but I just have not used it, and I don’t want to use it.</span> <span id="s1251">I have no desire to do that.</span> <span id="s1252">So I wanted to be an American so bad, and wanted to be part of, that for a whole while people never do.</span> <span id="s1253">When I came to Des Moines – trying to remember what I had when I finished school.</span> <span id="s1254">I got a job in the textile industry, after I came home from the army, in – in New York City.</span> <span id="s1255">And I never, ever let people know that I was born in – I really had a – I had a fixation that I wanted to be an American and I don’t want to talk about my past in Europe, and I – and it was very unpleasant for me, and I tried everything possible to lose my accent.</span> <span id="s1256">I had learned English very rapidly.</span> <span id="s1257">And it was really a psychological jump to at – my – it’s – if I wouldn’t tell you today, people here in Des Moines thing well, oh Fred Lorber, yeah, he’s got that New York accent.</span> <span id="s1258">So I go back to New York City, which quite often I used to, either five, six times a year, they all even think oh, it’s Fred, now got a – got a Midwestern accent.</span> <span id="s1259">So, it’s neither.</span> <span id="s1260">And so e – I had this – this anks – was it – not anxiety, but somehow I wouldn’t tell people I was born in Europe, for a long time.</span> <span id="s1261">And one of the greatest thing happened to me, that I got drafted.</span> <span id="s1262">And I, it turn out, was in the army for close to three years.</span> <span id="s1263">And it was the best thing that happened to me, and it really – it established my self-worth and – and I became an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Let me stop you again right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: So in – in that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: – transition, you know, I got to be very active here in Des Moines: I was president of the temple; I was president of the all in one campaign; I was president of the Jewish Federation; I was president of the Iowa Sales Executive Club, and I been involved in many of the – I don’t say this with – trying to impress you, but I’m just saying that my transition into the culture of America was total.</span> <span id="s1268">And so unless I tell people, oh, I was born – oh, what, you were born in Vienna?</span> <span id="s1269">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1270">So, that took me a long time to do that, to tell people I really wasn’t born in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Let me start – let me stop you right here, because I see that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: – we’ve – we’ve just done two hours, and I’m also aware of the fact that you might have to leave.</span> <span id="s1274">So I’m – I’m – I’m gonna pause this recording right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">End of File One Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fred Lorber, on December 8th, 2011.</span> <span id="s1278">The interview is conducted by Noemi Szekely-Popescu, in Washington, D.C. Fred Lorber is in Des Moines, Iowa.</span> <span id="s1279">This conversation is being taped over the phone, and this is the second part of the interview that was started December 2nd, 2011.</span> <span id="s1280">Fred, you were talking about getting drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: What was your first thought when you saw that?</span> <span id="s1283">Did you welcome it?</span> <span id="s1284">Were you apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Yes, I was – the letter started out, you know, usually everybody was called – it was greetings from President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1286">I mean, these were all, you know, pre-printed letters, so that’s how you were drafted.</span> <span id="s1287">But that’s when your notice came that you had to report to your local draft board.</span> <span id="s1288">And I was absolutely delighted, because many of my friends had left, already been in basic training and went to an SA – ASDP training session, where college students primarily were sent to learn a language, or a – some kind of specialty.</span> <span id="s1289">So, many of my friends had been – already been gone, and I was one of the youngest in the group, so – and I think they were also pretty bis – much undecided, the draft board, whether they can draft non-citizens.</span> <span id="s1290">Previously, I think maybe a year before or two years before, the post office used to have kind of posters as you walked in to mail your letters, so got a mail – mail order, a la – excuse me, a money order, or anything like that, had a sign up: beware of enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s1291">And being born in Vienna, Austria, I was, at that time, really considered an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s1292">That was kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Did you feel like that applied to you?</span> <span id="s1294">Did you have any –</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Well, I didn’t, you know, emotionally, or really, but still, I had to go and find out, you know, how do I get that stigma off.</span> <span id="s1296">And they said it wa – it wasn’t me, was people, you know, who were German, and they were afraid of, or [indecipherable] nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: And when you say – when you say they said that it wasn’t you, who are you referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: I went to the post office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: And they sent me to the local federal office –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: – which I questioned on, so at that particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Now, can –</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: So the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: – can you give me the approximate date when this happened, the draft?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: It had to be ninet – I could give you the year, but I couldn’t – this – we’ll disregard, somebody’s trying to get on – on the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Let me just think, 1940 – had to be 1941 or ‘40 – had to be in 1942.</span> <span id="s1309">The attack on Pearl Harbor came in December of ’41.</span> <span id="s1310">So, it had to be 1942 when those things appeared in the post offices, and other federal offices in New York City.</span> <span id="s1311">It was creating a little bit of a shock to me, because I wasn’t – I no longer considered myself an Austrian ail – an Austrian citizen, because, you know, we were disenfranchised; a very early part of the annexation of Austria to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: So anyways – hm, I’m looking out the window and there’s some dogs chasing deers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Do you – do you remember hearing about Pearl Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Yes, of course, I remember where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Oh, can you describe that day to me and what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: – what you were thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: I was outside, listening to a football – I was out with friends of mine, and I could tell you exactly who it – where it was, it was av – in New York City, in the Lower East Side, on Avenue C, between Second and Third Street, on the north side of aven – on the north side of Avenue C, and that was in front of a candy store.</span> <span id="s1320">At that time the hangouts of young people were outside of candy stores.</span> <span id="s1321">I didn’t know if you knew about that or not, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: I didn’t, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1323">My grandparents owned a candy store, but I did not know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1325">So – and then something came across the radio of an attack on Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s1326">Well, Pearl, we – there used to be some – number of women and young girls, they were in the Lower East Side, they were called Pearl.</span> <span id="s1327">And we just didn’t know, as I talked to some of my friends, where was pe – who was Pearl Harbor?</span> <span id="s1328">Where – or – there was very little knowledge about it.</span> <span id="s1329">And came as such a surprise.</span> <span id="s1330">And what happened that the broadcast of the New York Giants football game, which was played at the Polo Grounds at that time, was a ballpark in New York City, and it was interrupted with the news of Japanese bombarding Pearl Harbor, in Hawaii.</span> <span id="s1331">So that kind of – I remember that very distinctly, but what happened afterwards, I don’t quite remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Now you were saying that when you – when you first got the notice of the draft you weren’t sure as a non-citizen whether this applied to you?</span> <span id="s1333">Did I understand that correctly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: No, no, no, no, that came – this was before I got the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Then I received – then I was so delighted about maybe – must have been ’42 – ’41?</span> <span id="s1337">Two years later.</span> <span id="s1338">I want to s – that time, I had finished high school, ’42?</span> <span id="s1339">– 40 thr – yeah, in ’40 – yeah, in 1942 I finished Seward Park High School, and I went down to s – to the free college called CCNY.</span> <span id="s1340">It’s now, you know, City College of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: And – and also got a job after school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: As a mail clerk, just came usually at three o’clock in the afternoon until six, and it’s 125 Park Avenue in New York City.</span> <span id="s1345">I was – it was an insurance compensation office that was supported by many of the life insurance companies, and they set the rates, and I was a mail clerk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: And what were you studying at CCNY?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: What were you studying in college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Well, I worked at – wasn’t quite sure.</span> <span id="s1350">It was just the beginning.</span> <span id="s1351">First, you know, freshman year.</span> <span id="s1352">And so I was just going into looking maybe be an accountant or some other kind of – I really was looking forward maybe to go to graduate school after I got through with four years of college.</span> <span id="s1353">I was re – very undecided, wasn’t quite sure.</span> <span id="s1354">I just wanted to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Now, at this time, your – your family –</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Yes, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: – what – what was their circumstances like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I’m sorry?</span> <span id="s1359">Oh, my family’s circumstance, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Wh-What were the circumstances like, mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: I don’t know if I told you how we f – my parents or my dad first made the living, about selling socks out of a suitcase, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Yes, yes, you told us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1364">So, they bought a little grocery store –</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: – on East Church Street, right off the corner of Avenue C, one – maybe just one, maybe a half a building.</span> <span id="s1367">Was on the south side of the street, on East Church Street, and Avenue C, at the corner.</span> <span id="s1368">And, small store, and no help.</span> <span id="s1369">It was my dad, my mom and I.</span> <span id="s1370">But I just worked there part time after school.</span> <span id="s1371">I would help out, or deliver orders into the tenements, there were no elevators at all [indecipherable] steps, you know.</span> <span id="s1372">Second or third or fourth floor.</span> <span id="s1373">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Did they have to work very long hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Yes, we sa – opened up usually 6:30 in the morning, and closed about 10.</span> <span id="s1376">No help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Any days off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: No.</span> <span id="s1379">There was just my mom – excuse me, my dad, my mother and I. Well, I had a very small part, it was just them, those two.</span> <span id="s1380">But the store was very small.</span> <span id="s1381">It was – I don’t think he could have put another employee in there, it was kind of a – elongated and narrow.</span> <span id="s1382">And we sold all – it’s kind of a delicatessen –</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Do I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: – [indecipherable] and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Do I remember correctly that your – your mother had basically been at home in Austria, she had not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Yes, yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: – needed to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Never worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: How did she handle the transition to working, and working very long hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1391">I never really even thought about that, because we came, you know, we were immigrants.</span> <span id="s1392">We were – we had to reestablish ourselves.</span> <span id="s1393">So it was either we did it and everybody worked, or you just – you became a dependent – or even that not being citizen, I don’t know whether or not there was money available, like unemployment or things like that, and I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1394">So if you were going to have your self-respect, and made a livi – you know, knew that you had to make an honest living, you had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1395">And to get a job, I think my dad or my mom would not been able to do that, because they’re very limited on their English language at that time.</span> <span id="s1396">And they picked it up, you know, as they start working in the store.</span> <span id="s1397">And many of their customers were – were Jewish, and they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1398">And, it was a very Jewish neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: So, does that mean that it was relatively easy for them to start their lives here, because there were so many people they could interact with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: No, I think it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1401">You worked long hours, which my mother never worked in Vienna, you know, we had a very – well, kind of a comfortable life, and middle-class.</span> <span id="s1402">She didn’t – never had a job.</span> <span id="s1403">She – all she did, you know, she was cooking and taking care of the house, and took care of me s – when I was a small child.</span> <span id="s1404">And my father had a very good job.</span> <span id="s1405">Worked five days a week.</span> <span id="s1406">We went away every summer, took a place out in the country.</span> <span id="s1407">So that you – the quality of life was quite substantially better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: And you don’t – you don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: But the key issue though, coming to the United States was the freedom.</span> <span id="s1410">The acceptance of us being foreigners, being Jewish, having just escaped this den of anti-Semitism, you know, it – th-the dilemma of not being a citizen any more, and our lives being very, very vulnerable.</span> <span id="s1411">You know, my dad being – having been in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1412">So every little thing that we saw in America was a blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: And their loss of socio-economic status did not upset them in any way that you could –</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: – detect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1417">The – tha – but it’s a very good question, because I felt that very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Can you talk about that a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Yes, I – and I’m – I’m kind of an embarrassen – embarrassed to tell you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Because I wanted to be an American so bad, and I had all American friends, I really lost contact – I knew a few people from Vienna, friends, you know, or people I went to school with, but somehow I lost all contacts, because all my friends were American.</span> <span id="s1422">And I decided I wanted to be an American and I began hiding my identity.</span> <span id="s1423">In other words, I didn’t tell peop – once my English got – is like it is today, very shortly, I really – I should tell you my first book report in high school, where my English was absolutely almost nonexistent.</span> <span id="s1424">And it was “A Tale of Two Cities,” by Dickens.</span> <span id="s1425">And I read it in German, I cut it out of the – I found the book at the library in German and also in English, and I translated it, and I know no English, I used an American English dictionary, and an English and a German English dictionary and – to do the book report.</span> <span id="s1426">At that kind of got – convinced me, in order for me to forget about that I came from Vienna, that I came from Austria, and to be an American, just like everybody else, I had to learn English.</span> <span id="s1427">And before I transferred to Seward Park High School, I went to Alexander Hamilton High in Brooklyn for just one semester.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Why did you transfer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: When I first – we first came.</span> <span id="s1430">I think it was one semester, maybe two, but really think it was one.</span> <span id="s1431">And I had an English teacher, a – a – a woman, it’s just her name escapes me right now, but sh – it’ll come back to me, cause she was indelible in my mind, who stayed with me after school maybe two times a week.</span> <span id="s1432">Made me – and taught me how to pronounce English words that – particularly if you’re a foreigner, you had trouble with the T-H.</span> <span id="s1433">There’s – because it’s a new sound that you don’t have in other languages, the th – th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: So, that had tremendous impact upon me, and I was determined the only way I can truly be accepted like everybody else, and not be called a refugee, a [indecipherable] and they had all kinds of names for people that – it – I don’t think that new immigrants were very welcome at that time, even though there were many in – new immigrants, you know, living – your grandparents or whoever it was, had come from another country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1437">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: And – and they assimilated, but then again, there was a – there was a resistance of the Jewish community, I think, to new people coming in from the occupied territories in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Did it – did you feel like it mattered that you had come from Austria, and was – was that an issue for the Jewish community, and had you come from Poland, it would have been different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: No.</span> <span id="s1441">I think – that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1442">I think Austrian – Austrian Jews were more assimilated than the Jews that came from Poland.</span> <span id="s1443">You know, they came from the little shtetls, small villages, and that – we were well educated in Jewish history and language and – and probably – and maybe have learned a lot of language, Polish or German, particularly where – it was – if it was worse than Poland, which was part of the Hapsburg empire at one time.</span> <span id="s1444">Still, the American Jews looked down on the immigrants at that particular time.</span> <span id="s1445">That changed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Yourself included, you feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Were there any incidents that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Yeah, but I think that – that the – I come – come from – more from a western part of Europe, that I was a little different.</span> <span id="s1452">Many of people who came from Germany, Jews who came from Germany, and from Austria and some of the western countries, settled in upper bra – on upper Broadway.</span> <span id="s1453">You know, 68th Street and up.</span> <span id="s1454">And that was – became a very strong Jewish immigrant community, and they even had their own newspaper called the auf – I think it was called the “Aufbau,” meaning building, again, or you know, building in new community.</span> <span id="s1455">And lot of German speaking businesses existed there.</span> <span id="s1456">So I had a cousin who was a physician, who could not get into medical school in the United States, and when the war ended, he went to Italy to get his medical training.</span> <span id="s1457">And he later became Isaac Bashevis Singer [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: And they lived up in that area.</span> <span id="s1460">He lived in Yorkville, like off Lexington Avenue.</span> <span id="s1461">I don’t know if you know much about New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: A little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Yeah, so – and when – I se – a little side story, I’ll – when Isaac Bashevis su – Singer received the Nobel prize for literature in Stockholm, he was going to go with him.</span> <span id="s1464">And so he found out that he had to wear a – a formal – formal clothes, not just a tuxedo, but tails, when the prize was given.</span> <span id="s1465">And if he was going to be shiv – Singer’s guest at that ceremony.</span> <span id="s1466">So he rented some – a tail, you know, to take with him to Sweden, and his wife, and go with the Singers.</span> <span id="s1467">I think he was married – Singer was married at that time.</span> <span id="s1468">As he crossed Lexington Avenue, got hit by a taxi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: So they broke his leg and he couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1471">Yeah, that was really a big tragedy in his life.</span> <span id="s1472">He was invited to go to Nobel prize, you know, for literature, and being there as a guest of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: And this was your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Yeah, that was my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: And even though your cousin –</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: [indecipherable] I’m afraid no longer lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: E-Even though your cousin was in that circles, am I assuming correctly that you weren’t really interacting with German speaking Jews because you wanted to shed that identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: I wanted – yes, I want – i-i-in other words, if I understand you correctly, I wanted to be an American so badly, so – I interacted all with Americans, young people.</span> <span id="s1479">They became my friends, I became their friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: When did you change your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: From Fritz to Fred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: I think immediately, when – soon as I got – I was absolutely very vulnerable.</span> <span id="s1484">When I moved war – I took a job in Des Moines.</span> <span id="s1485">At that time my English – which was in 19 – January – early December of 1949, or fift – no, it’s really January of 1950 – no one knew, including the people who hired me – that I was just going to stay in Des Moines for – for a couple years.</span> <span id="s1486">We are – we were – we were married to an American girl.</span> <span id="s1487">We had one child, and my wife was pregnant with the second one, and we moved here, and I never, ever let on that I came from Vienna, Austria.</span> <span id="s1488">To this very day, I think 90 percent people here – because I became very active in the community, knew that I came from a foreign country.</span> <span id="s1489">It wasn’t until about 25 years ago, or 30 years ago that it – that it all of a sudden it didn’t matter to me ata – again.</span> <span id="s1490">I was enough self-confidence that apparently I built.</span> <span id="s1491">I mean, it’s just like a self-analysis, but – that I felt I – my ego really wasn’t vulnerable any more.</span> <span id="s1492">You know, I’ve been here, I’ve received national – what would you call – National Conference of Christian Jews award as being an outstanding Jewish citizen in Des Moines.</span> <span id="s1493">It used to be given every year, and I got another – I became president of children’s or families’ services, which is the largest social agency in Iowa.</span> <span id="s1494">And I was very – I was – became president of the temple, and I headed the – the fund drive for the National Jewish Fund, and other things.</span> <span id="s1495">I was president of the temple and other things, I got very active in – within the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: What – what inspired you to – to serve and to be active like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: I think it’s a good question, I think probably my – my – if I really ask you, it is my ego, I think.</span> <span id="s1498">I don’t tell this to anybody, I’ll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Oh, it’s just you and me here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: But they’re not going to say this – yeah.</span> <span id="s1501">Or it was my feeling that I wanted to be like every – I think if really, if I had some sub – subconscious motivations, I think that’s probably what it was, to be recognized, and that was just [indecipherable] like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1502">I was no longer, you know, a – a refugee, an immigrant, a second – second class citizen.</span> <span id="s1503">I had this – that this community here gave me that unbelievable opportunity to really actualize my life.</span> <span id="s1504">So, I think that’s what it was, and to this very day, you know, I’m – I’m pres – excuse me, I’m – I’m on – I’m the only Jewish member of a Methodist college called Citizen College.</span> <span id="s1505">I’m trying to find somebody else that’s Jewish that would serve on the board here.</span> <span id="s1506">And I – and I was pretty participatory in many other organizations.</span> <span id="s1507">So I think all that may have been, if you really cut it deep into my – my own emotional, I guess deeds or inadequacies, I think that helped me a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Thank you for sharing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yeah, but I – you know, maybe I should have gone for therapy sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: No, I don’t think you need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: I know – no, I’ve figured out you know, I had the – a couple of friends of mine who were psychiatrists and – and I always remember one time we were at a dinner and I was sitting next to one of the – one of the physicians who was very quiet, but he was a – a therapist.</span> <span id="s1512">And he turns to me, he says – and – and I’m – I’m kind of, very social, and he turns to me, he says, you really are – Fred, you rece – you’re so social because you’re really an introvert.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: What an insight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: It shocked me, oh, it sho – it shocked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Do you think he was onto something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Do you think he was onto something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: I think probably I’m overcompensating.</span> <span id="s1519">I think so.</span> <span id="s1520">I think that’s what motivated me.</span> <span id="s1521">You know, I took this job and I became president, it was a very – what do I say, a very American company, and I became president of the company.</span> <span id="s1522">Never planned it to me.</span> <span id="s1523">I went to – then I also bought – I left the company after I was president and bought an interest in another company, and I s-started another company with a couple of immigrants, Russian immigrants, which they still work – still running here in – in I – in Des Moines, now owned by a large syndicate, and has about 300 employees.</span> <span id="s1524">And two Russians were started in business, because I was, at that time I think, president of the Jewish Federation, and I went to the airport to greet two im – when we took at – every community at that time, took it upon themselves to resettle some Russian Jews that were able to get out of Russia where there was a lot of anti-Semitism at that time in the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: So what – what years were these?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Ah, it has – it had to be 1940 – I’m sorry, 1970 – ’73 or ’74.</span> <span id="s1527">So what happened was, I went to the airport to greet them, in – on behalf of the Jewish community, two couples.</span> <span id="s1528">Should I share that with you?</span> <span id="s1529">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1531">One couple was Steralzeslsky(ph), the other was Ruchstein(ph), they were both engineers.</span> <span id="s1532">One wife was a physician and the other wife a concert pianist.</span> <span id="s1533">And I was taken with them immediately, because I somehow superimposed myself into their situation, I guess: new immigrants, well-educated, talented.</span> <span id="s1534">And I got them jobs, and – at a engineering company, they were both engineers, the men.</span> <span id="s1535">One wife was a physician, the other wife a pianist, a – played at the Kir-Kirov-Kirov – Kirov Opera Company in Leningrad, at that time, now St. Petersburg.</span> <span id="s1536">And – and I got to be very close to them, because these were the first immigrants we – that the Jewish community took on upon themselves to settle them.</span> <span id="s1537">We got them an apartment, we – I got them English teachers, and found jobs for them.</span> <span id="s1538">A friend of mine that was president of a steel company here and also was Jewish, I called him up and I says, you got – you know, got to help me.</span> <span id="s1539">I have these two Russians, they very – look like very smart engineers, they don’t speak much English, I need jobs for them.</span> <span id="s1540">So he gave them the jobs.</span> <span id="s1541">And I got fairly close to them, and my associates at the business that I just was buying in, there’s a father and son who owned that company, it’s a company that was making quilted nylon fabrics in Des Moines and had another plant in Arkansas, Magnolia, Arkansas.</span> <span id="s1542">And about six months later, my friend who owned – excuse me, who was president of steel company called Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel called me up, he says, I’m not doing these two Russians any favors.</span> <span id="s1543">I said, why?</span> <span id="s1544">He said, well, they’re to – two sophisticated engineers, and I should find them other jobs.</span> <span id="s1545">So I met with them, and they showed me patents, but I couldn’t read them as done in Cyrillic Russian, and – but I could make out their names.</span> <span id="s1546">So I went to my two partners and I said, why don’t we each put in some money and il – and – would – enough to kind of get a lawyer and get – get their – get their patents that they had in Russia registered in the United States [indecipherable] on controlling any kind of liquid going through pipelines, and through compressors and things like that, and they had figured out a system that would automatically control those compressors.</span> <span id="s1547">So one thing that they moved into my office, so I learned a little Russian, I listened to Russian music [indecipherable] little – little radios tuned into a Russian – I don’t know how they heck they got the Russian station.</span> <span id="s1548">So we became very good friends and we got them their patents and then my three – two partners and I put in each 25,000 dollars to get them rolling.</span> <span id="s1549">And that’s when they moved into my office, I kind of forgot about that.</span> <span id="s1550">So that’s – after 10 or 12 years of this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Of them in your office?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: – and it caused a lot of problems and it was a really – it was a – it turned out if I succeeded, it was sold, the first company was sold the first time for – oh, a investment company in Minneapolis bought 60 percent and I – I don’t quite remember the numbers, but they were like six million dollars –</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: – that they invested, and then – and I didn’t want to sell the company, but my two other partners and – and now Mr. Ruzelski(ph) then became president, and he wanted to buy – he wanted – he had gotten a condo in [indecipherable] they had the beautiful home in Palisades in New York, and – and Kahn(ph) was the other one, in par – I mean, in – in France.</span> <span id="s1555">So we sold the company the first time at I think about 25 million dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: So then it was – we got it back – it was a whole nars – it – it deserves another book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1559">Did the Russians stay in your office for 10 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: So – yeah, anyways – anyways, yeah, the company is owned by a conglomerate, and we still – I think we still employ about 250 or 300 people here in Des Moines.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Oh, goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: So, it was really a – the Russians are out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: The Russians are out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: They’re all sold out, yes.</span> <span id="s1565">Even – I’ll tell you who was our sales manager for a while, Shevalski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: You know who sh – sh – you know who the Shevalskis(ph) are, that’s the brother of the Israeli Shevanksi(ph) – Shevanski(ph).</span> <span id="s1568">So I got involved with the Russian community.</span> <span id="s1569">We brought a lot of Russians into Des Moines at that time.</span> <span id="s1570">Now the company may have three or four Russians left, that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Now when – when – when –</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: That’s another story we could probably write.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: When you – when you helped those two families come here in the early 70s, was – was that the first time you were helping refugees from Europe after the war, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: So in the immediate postwar period, you were not – you were not part of any kind of communities who were – who were either placing refugees, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Well, no, we were busy establishing ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: And both, you know, commercially, or financially, or emotionally or psychologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: And I don’t think my parents ever really assimilated, and they sold – they – they got into a bigger store, and then another bigger store and they finally sold out, and they retired, and moved into Brooklyn, on eastern – not Eastern Parkway, Ocean Parkway.</span> <span id="s1581">I used to go and go visit them.</span> <span id="s1582">And my father couldn’t stand retiring, so they bought a little business in kind of a market on – selling haberdashery.</span> <span id="s1583">And it got held up one time, and the guy left him bloody and unconscious on the floor.</span> <span id="s1584">I flew into New York at that time.</span> <span id="s1585">I used to go to New York about four or five times on business every year.</span> <span id="s1586">And – and then I flew in for that, and my dad was in the hospital, and at that time I sold up – I went and sold th-their business, I would not let him go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: What – what year was this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: So he retired –</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: – how old was he at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: That had to be, I don’t know, 60s, or 70s, late 60s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: So he would have been around 70 by then?</span> <span id="s1592">A: Well, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1593">I just celebrated my 88th birthday, so that had to be – I was in my 60s, probably.</span> <span id="s1594">Had to be, yeah, yeah, I was still young.</span> <span id="s1595">I was still flying all over the country.</span> <span id="s1596">So I – and you know – and I’m trying to remember whether I was still working for ya – my other company, was president, or was my new company.</span> <span id="s1597">So I g – I have to go back and talk to my wife about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Now, let’s go back to the years ’41 and ’42.</span> <span id="s1601">When – when did you get your citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Four – exactly?</span> <span id="s1603">1940 – I was drafted 19 – the war started 1941 - ’42.</span> <span id="s1604">I went in the army in ’43.</span> <span id="s1605">Okay, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: That is when you got your citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yes, I wa – I was in – I was finish basic training in Camp Croft, South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: In basic training, did you – I – I – I – I’d like to get a – a better picture of you as a young man.</span> <span id="s1609">Were you – were you a – a sporty type?</span> <span id="s1610">Wa-Was this a hard thing for you to go through, basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1612">It wasn’t hard, no, I hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: Why did you hate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: I hated bayonet training, I hated sleeping in a ditch.</span> <span id="s1615">I – I trained as an infantry, I had a [indecipherable] 745, which was my [indecipherable] rifleman and machine gunner.</span> <span id="s1616">Zero Mostel, you know, who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: He was in my barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: He hated it worse than I did.</span> <span id="s1621">I used to do his field packs and help him, because he really was like – there’s a Jewish expression, like a laymach(ph).</span> <span id="s1622">That was he was very – not very coordinated, believe it or not, at that time.</span> <span id="s1623">He was heavy overweight, and everything was a joke with him.</span> <span id="s1624">So, we remained friends, I mean, somewhat, I didn’t see him very often.</span> <span id="s1625">I – every time I – when I go to New York I would look him up if he was in a play.</span> <span id="s1626">So, it was a – but the basic training that I took was in vi – but it – many of the people in my company were foreign born.</span> <span id="s1627">They had – they didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s1628">So, we all took basic training, and many of the – many of the people were older than I was.</span> <span id="s1629">I was, you know, I was fairly young, and had a great education, or had special talents.</span> <span id="s1630">And I remember doing KP.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Kitchen – kitchen duty, you know.</span> <span id="s1633">Every so often you had to help out in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1634">Hated it.</span> <span id="s1635">You know, peel potatoes and things like that for the rest of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: So what – what did you hate about it?</span> <span id="s1637">Was it the discomfort?</span> <span id="s1638">Did you feel that it was pointless –</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: I didn’t hate it, I loved the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Oh you – but you hated the basic training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Yeah, it was, you know, being that I was tired all the time, and I slept in – in foxholes.</span> <span id="s1642">They taught us – and I was in the infantry, which is – that’s the one they do all the fighting.</span> <span id="s1643">So there – you know, these are the people that are in combat positions.</span> <span id="s1644">So I tell you, one day I’m sitting outside after a hard day of training, and I was sitting in a common disc – ara – area which is called the common.</span> <span id="s1645">You know, in front of the barracks, and it must have been summer.</span> <span id="s1646">And I look up and I see a guy, boy that looks familiar.</span> <span id="s1647">Oh my God, can it be?</span> <span id="s1648">Someone that was in the same gymnasium or the same school in Vienna –</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: – that I was.</span> <span id="s1651">Name was Irving Geringer, and I holler, Irving, Irving.</span> <span id="s1652">He turns around, it was him.</span> <span id="s1653">And he and his brother were – didn’t live far from us.</span> <span id="s1654">His father was a first violinist at the Vienna Philharmonic before the Nazis came, and Irving was extremely smart, I remember him in gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1655">He was born a year ahead of me and – but he was a very smart student, like, you know, like a four point.</span> <span id="s1656">And – and I saw – I was so startled, you know, to meet someone from my gymnasium, my high school in Vienna, same company.</span> <span id="s1657">And we spent men – much of our army time together.</span> <span id="s1658">He – he had a very high I.Q., and he became [indecipherable] he was – really did the job, did most of the work.</span> <span id="s1659">He worked with one major, it’s an officer, to write the story of the campaign, of the Italian campaign, because he and I both landed up in North Africa, and then on in Italy.</span> <span id="s1660">And I spent all my – year of my – the war years in Italy.</span> <span id="s1661">And he wrote a b – he wrote the official book of the campaign, which is in Library of Congress, and I looked it up one day.</span> <span id="s1662">And he and I – wherever I was, Irving had this freedom to travel throughout the – the war area, because he was doing all this – this all historic writing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: He – he – he was doing that during what time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: – and he would look and hound me everyplace I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Th-This was after the war ended, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: No, that was during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: It was during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: And so – so he had been recruited for his – his writing talents, into a special – he had some sort of special position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Yes, yes, but he was much smarter, he had a high – much higher I.Q. than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Did you get an I.Q. test?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Yeah, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Did they give you one at the – in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Yes, I’ve got an I.Q. test.</span> <span id="s1675">I – there wasn’t as – I thought I was much smarter than what the test [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Did you and Irving speak German or English to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: No, we talked English only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: So Irving was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: And we kept our friendship right through the war, and we were very close while we lived in New York.</span> <span id="s1680">His father became the concertmaster at the – which is the first chair in the orchestra – at the Metropolitan Opera Company.</span> <span id="s1681">And so we went to the opera very often, for free.</span> <span id="s1682">And became kind of a steady guy at the Metropolitan Opera – that’s when they were still down on 1407, which is 1407 Broadway, and then they moved uptown to Lincoln Center, and we did – I still remember going, how amazed we were [indecipherable] opera company, Irving and I did.</span> <span id="s1683">We were – became very good fre – I gotta tell you a quick anec – ac – anecdote.</span> <span id="s1684">Not anecdote, thing that happened to him and me.</span> <span id="s1685">When the war ended, I moved up from Italy into – of – U-USF – US – US force – USFA.</span> <span id="s1686">US Forces in Austria.</span> <span id="s1687">They apparently went through my – through, you know, my – every G.I. had that IBM card.</span> <span id="s1688">I didn’t have it, but they had it.</span> <span id="s1689">We traveled with trucks in the wors – in worse environments, that had the first machines, IBM cards, they were – had holes in them.</span> <span id="s1690">And they had these machines in the trucks, they’re big, big – they were very big semis.</span> <span id="s1691">And – and you – all your – your record and who you are, your names, your schooling, your I.Q., whatever you did, was on that one card, it had holes in it.</span> <span id="s1692">So if they want to pull the – that the army wanted to pull you up, because looking for certain specialties that people may have, they would somehow run these cards through these machines, and it’ll come up.</span> <span id="s1693">So, when the war ended, my outfit was moved – was going to be moved back to the States, but then they redirected it to Japan – not to Japan, but to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s1694">So, I got pulled out, and I always wondered how – why didn’t I go with my outfit?</span> <span id="s1695">So apparently my Viennese birth and my German knowledge, I landed up in US Forces in Austria, on the mar – on the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1696">Then, he was the commanding general of the campaign in – in Italy, that went from the bottom of the boot all the way up to the Po River, where I served all my military overseas.</span> <span id="s1697">So then my friend Irving wrote the book about the campaign, the Italian campaign.</span> <span id="s1698">So, I-I find myself pulled out and sent to a staging area and then I get orders that I am now part of USFA ma – US Forces in Austria.</span> <span id="s1699">So I am the only really Viennese person in a contingent of about 200 - 300 G.I.s that will make the invasion back in – not invasion, but because the Russians got there before us, but reoccupation of Vienna.</span> <span id="s1700">I – did I tell you that yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: I’m not sure whether it was part of the recording, but I certainly knew that as a part of your story –</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: – and I do want to hear more about that, but I think we’re ahead of ourselves.</span> <span id="s1704">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Okay, I’ll go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: So let’s go back to 1943, and your basic training and your time, before you get shipped out; did you ever feel any hostility because you were foreign born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Did you ever feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: In fact, one day –</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: – I got called to the orderly room.</span> <span id="s1712">And the first sergeant is tell me that recent telegram to me.</span> <span id="s1713">He said he has a request from – order from Hapsburg [indecipherable] of K-Kaiser Franz Joseph from Austria, that they starting an Austrian battalion, part of the US Army, or the – their allies, that they want me to join to go to become part of the Austrian – I was Austrian battalion, you know, combat battalion.</span> <span id="s1714">I was so shocked when they read that to me and asked me if I want to go, and I said absolutely not, I’m an American and I want to stay here and I want to train here and I want to stay in the American army.</span> <span id="s1715">I have no desire to fight for the Austrians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: You were already a citizen when you got that – when you got that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Not yet, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: – I was not a citizen.</span> <span id="s1720">I was just here four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Mm-hm, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: So, you want to hear what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: So I’m getting sh – now we get orders to ship out.</span> <span id="s1725">I now get assigned to overseas replacement, no outfit, but the – I was called a – a replacement, going to a repo depot.</span> <span id="s1726">That was like where you waited, and then, for example, the third division, or the 45th or 36th, that was – is a fighting position in Italy.</span> <span id="s1727">When they had casualties they would put in a request for replacements.</span> <span id="s1728">So that’s what I was trained to be, a replacement.</span> <span id="s1729">So, on the way, to figure out that we’re going overseas, from Hampton Roads, Virginia, they find out I’m not a citizen, the army.</span> <span id="s1730">So they take me in Pennsylvania – we were a staging area, Camp Shenango, I still remember that.</span> <span id="s1731">And they find a federal judge – I’m only in this country four years and to be a citizen you have to be here five years, to be naturalized.</span> <span id="s1732">And they convince a judge that I have to ship overseas, and they need me overseas and I’ve been trained, to make me a citizen.</span> <span id="s1733">So, I think I’m the only citizen in the United States that kind of did it in four years, rather than this is required five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: It was advanced placement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: It was advanced placement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Yeah, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1738">So, I can’t – I became a citizen.</span> <span id="s1739">I looked – you know, if you look at my naturalization paper, I’m there – you know, it’s a picture of me in a uniform.</span> <span id="s1740">So – and I was so proud of myself, I mean, my God, finally, four years in this country and I’m now a citizen.</span> <span id="s1741">I’m speaking English, I’m part of the American army, I’m going oversea, I’m going to fight the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1742">My God, I was so happy, you can’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: And there wasn’t any apprehensiveness about danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: No, I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1745">I just couldn’t wait.</span> <span id="s1746">What a way to get even.</span> <span id="s1747">What was what – you know, what an opportunity, to become part of the American milieu and the American army, finally, you know, nobody’s going to question my citizenship, so nobody’s going to question who I am, because now I’m serving in the American army, and I’m fighting for – for our existence and to bring democracy back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Was there ever any hostility because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Was there ever any hostility in the army, or any kind of differentiation because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: I never, ever – maybe once, and I know it was just some guy from the Ozarks or someplace, wasn’t a very smart guy, made one remark.</span> <span id="s1752">No, I never, ever had any kind of ant – any anti-Semitic remark made to me.</span> <span id="s1753">My three closest friends are; one from Kansas; one from the state of Washington; and one from Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1754">We’re very close.</span> <span id="s1755">We really for a while were – were able to stay together, and never has there ever been a question of my religion, or of being Jewish or not, for some reason.</span> <span id="s1756">Maybe I assimilated well, I don’t know, but I think that maybe had something to do with it.</span> <span id="s1757">I found two of my cousins that came from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1758">This is my cell phone.</span> <span id="s1759">That’s my granddaughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Do – do you need me to pause the recording?</span> <span id="s1761">Do you want to ge –</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Yeah, would you hold on?</span> <span id="s1763">No-Now, hold on, don’t get off –</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: I won’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: – I’ll tell her that I’m talking to you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Hold on.</span> <span id="s1770">Hi Laura.</span> <span id="s1771">How are you sweetie?</span> <span id="s1772">Yeah, listen, I’m on the phone on an interview with the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1773">What time would that be?</span> <span id="s1774">So that’s – that’s about three to four on my time.</span> <span id="s1775">That’d be great, terrific.</span> <span id="s1776">I really, really miss talking to you, and you know, it’s like I’m half alive.</span> <span id="s1777">All right.</span> <span id="s1778">All right, so I’ll talk to you in a couple – few hours.</span> <span id="s1779">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1780">Love you.</span> <span id="s1781">Bye.</span> <span id="s1782">I have the most remarkable granddaughter you could think of.</span> <span id="s1783">There are two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: This is one of the two.</span> <span id="s1786">My grands – my son-in-law is dean of the law school at the – at the ci – in – in California, I forget the school now.</span> <span id="s1787">Ha, most obvious things, yeah.</span> <span id="s1788">And she is – this is one of my granddaughters and she’s not going into graduate school over there, she just found out.</span> <span id="s1789">But in the meantime, she’s teaching all these smart kids, she says, kindergarten.</span> <span id="s1790">And that she – they all either work for Google or they work for [indecipherable] also, so they’re at – at Stanford, or they all at one or the other high tech companies, she says, and their kids are spoiled as – unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1791">Anyways, she’ll call back, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: All right, where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Well, you were saying that you never felt any bad feelings towards you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: – either because you were foreign born, or because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1797">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: And you couldn’t wait to get into the European theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: It was a – like homecoming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1803">The other people who were in your unit who were foreign born, where there many who were from Germany or Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: My friend Irving is the one I – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: – that I traveled with a lot.</span> <span id="s1807">And no, I don’t think, in my out – but once I got assigned to the headquarters of the Fifth Army, in adjutant general’s office, I got pulled out while I was in North Africa.</span> <span id="s1808">I was waiting to replace – to replace – I was – the lowest form of army life was being an – a infantry replacement.</span> <span id="s1809">They used to call it cannon fodder, cause we came there totally inexperienced, and the people who – who still were the 45th or 36th, or third divisions, which would have three divisions that were const – by the Fifth Army, cons – were part of the – I mean, they were the Fifth Army, where all the people that survived, you know, combat wounds or death were extraordinary lucky, or they were skillful.</span> <span id="s1810">And so, because it’s casualty rate was pretty high at that time.</span> <span id="s1811">So – and we didn’t know very much.</span> <span id="s1812">There was – I got stuck in that river, called Rapido River, and Cassino, I don’t know if you ever heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1814">But at that point were – you’re already in Italy, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: Yeah, that’s when I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: – I wasn’t in Africa very long.</span> <span id="s1818">I took a long train ride that they assigned me to go – what happened, I was pulled out.</span> <span id="s1819">Apparently they looked at my service records and I was – I went over there as an infantry replacement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: And I turned out that I got orders to go to – to fly into southern Italy, south of Naples.</span> <span id="s1822">Cassera(ph) I think was the name of the town, who – we had made the invasion a very short time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: But when –</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: And [indecipherable] comes.</span> <span id="s1825">So anyways, I never really got right into a combat situation at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1827">But when – where – where did you first – I’m guessing you were on a boat, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Yes, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: – on a – on a – on the Normandie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: And where did it touch ground first in North Africa?</span> <span id="s1832">Where did you get off –</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Casablanca.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Casablanca.</span> <span id="s1835">And did you take a train from Casablanca?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: No, I stayed in Casablanca for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: A staging area, and then I took a train.</span> <span id="s1839">Then I moved – I don’t quite remember, I took a train.</span> <span id="s1840">Then I moved – I don’t quite remember.</span> <span id="s1841">I took a train – that was the end of my vis – my stay in Africa, when I took that train.</span> <span id="s1842">And that train took seven days to arrive at its destination.</span> <span id="s1843">All of North Africa I think I travel – traveled, from Morocco to – to – I landed up in Tunis.</span> <span id="s1844">Not in Tunis, I’m sorry, I landed up in Azures(ph).</span> <span id="s1845">I was in Tunis all at a – on a – a G.I. train, run by American railroad pe – I mean army guys, but they were railroad battalion.</span> <span id="s1846">And it was one of the most ex – one of the – to me, it was one of the outstanding adventures that I had in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Being on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Yes, because I went and saw Bedouins, and remarkable, and I – it wasn’t that I [indecipherable] passenger, I was a fo – in a 40 and eight.</span> <span id="s1849">You know what a 40 and eight is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: It’s a – a – that’s how they transported, unfortunately, people into Dachau and to other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1852">They were baggage cars, you know, where they transported –</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: – things, not people.</span> <span id="s1855">But that’s how the army traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: So I got there, I got orders and I – they – I took the train, that took us six or seven days, and I landed up in als – the city of Algiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Which was, at that time, very French.</span> <span id="s1860">It was like being in Paris.</span> <span id="s1861">I was there for about like two or three days, and maybe longer, and I was put into a B17.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: A plane that’s – that was B17 [inaudible] and then it went upward, higher numbers until B29, so th-the big four – this was a two – two motors, I think, if I remember.</span> <span id="s1864">And they pulled out the machine guns out of the front of there.</span> <span id="s1865">First time I’ve ever been on an airplane.</span> <span id="s1866">And flew and flew –</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: How did that feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: Fantastic.</span> <span id="s1869">I didn’t sit and – I sat there in the bubble, you know the bubble?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: No, what’s the bubble?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: The bubble is where the guns stick out, and it’s Plexiglas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Oh, so you had a great aerial view?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: Oh, my God, it was – yes.</span> <span id="s1874">I’ve never been in an airplane in my life, and I’m sitting in this bubble, going over the Mediterranean, out of the coast of North Africa into Italy –</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: And this is day – daylight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Daylight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: It was – it was in the daytime that you were so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1879">And it was fantastic.</span> <span id="s1880">We had just finished and one – chased the Germans out of Sicily, and now we’re getting ready to march up, or to – to chase them out of Italy, you know, the boot, we’re at the bottom of the boot.</span> <span id="s1881">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1883">So you get to Italy and what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Italy, I get assigned to the adjutant general’s office and I get with a fellow from Atlanta, Georgia who had requested me, was a sergeant, to be – to open up APOs, army post offices, which I knew nothing about.</span> <span id="s1885">And I was part of the adjutant general’s division of the Fifth Army, so instead of being up on the firing line with the 33rd – 34th or 45th division, which that time ran a cam – ran a campaign, I land up – opening up army post office, which I did not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Was that a disappointment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Was that a disappointment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Well, kind of a mixed feeling.</span> <span id="s1890">Number one, I – you know, I did experience a little bit of combat, but not as much as I should have.</span> <span id="s1891">I got – we got stuck before, at the Rapido River, which was in southern Italy, and at a place called Cassino, which was an abbey on top of a mountain, that the Germans has put big guns on it and we couldn’t get across the Rapido River.</span> <span id="s1892">I got in too late into Anzio, which is a beach, was an attack trying to circumvent the uk – the [indecipherable] way because it was muddy and – and very difficult, and Germans had really great positions on it.</span> <span id="s1893">So, it was great, I had – I was – I went from Naples, as we conquered territories up to Rome, from Rome to Venice – not, sorry, from Rome to Florence, and from Florence to the heck – over on the Adriatic, I’ve forgotten the name of the town.</span> <span id="s1894">It was fi – it was a fantastic adventure.</span> <span id="s1895">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: Did you ever – did you ever interact with Italians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: With what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: With – with the locals, the – the Italians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: How did they react to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: They were extremely friendly and I – one of the things that the G.I.s did, they – they used to bi – have – always there’s someplace that somebody always was cooking spaghetti.</span> <span id="s1902">And for very little, so very little, few liras, you cou – would go to their homes and they would have a great meals of spaghetti –</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Had you had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: – true Italian spaghetti, and I always remember that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: Had you ever had Italian food back in New York before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s1907">Well, I can’t remember was after the war, before the war, probably after the war that we could – became a little bit – my friends and I, we – when we first married, we were going to good restaurants upstate – uh, I mean, further uptown in New York.</span> <span id="s1908">No, I don’t think – I don’t think – it wasn’t until I came out of the army and I got married that I really began to enjoy the – the culture that America provided me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: And these Italians who had – you would cook spaghetti for a few lira, would you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: I didn’t cook, they cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: Th-They cooked, they cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Were they inviting you into their living rooms –</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Yes, it’s in their homes, their homes, yes.</span> <span id="s1915">It was not unus – it was pretty com – it was very common.</span> <span id="s1916">They had no money.</span> <span id="s1917">They, you know, they were very poor, you know, the war devastated much of their surroundings, and there was – you know, I lived in Florence for six months, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: That must have been nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: Yes, on top of the mount – on top of the Vomaro(ph) nord(ph) – I think that’s what it was called.</span> <span id="s1920">It was – I didn’t know I was going to get there, but I, maybe 15 years ago, 20 years ago, a group of us from Des Moines were biking from Venice to Florence on our bikes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: That’s quite something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: About six or seven days, yeah, along the beach, along the – the Adriatic.</span> <span id="s1923">And I got to – to – I can’t remember the suburb of Florence, where I stayed for six months in a – almost a castle, a – a wonderful, beautiful palace.</span> <span id="s1924">And when I – we took this – friends of mine and I from Des Moines, there was a whole group of us, did this bike ride, we landed up at that place.</span> <span id="s1925">This must be maybe 15 - 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s1926">And I stood there and I couldn’t believe – I mean, was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s1927">And I asked myself, did I really appreciate the beauty of this when I was there in 1944 – ’43 - ’44?</span> <span id="s1928">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: When – when you would – I – I suppose you and many other G.I.s were eating the spaghetti, how did that – how did that work?</span> <span id="s1930">Did the locals come over and say, are you hungry, do you have a few lira, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: No, no, no, no, no, you found – there were – G.I.s had a fantastic system of communications.</span> <span id="s1932">One guy tells another, hey, we’re eating at the mayor’s house.</span> <span id="s1933">His – his wife cooked the spaghetti, cost you like X amount of liras, like two dollars, or something like that, but it was all liras, occupation money.</span> <span id="s1934">It was – so you found it, you went and found and other guys knew.</span> <span id="s1935">It traveled – it traveled very easily.</span> <span id="s1936">It was a very – the communication system was unbelievable, you know, everybody told everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: And this was – this was common practice throughout the places you stayed in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: I don’t know – not all places, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: It happened in – it much happened in Naples.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: A little place called Bagnoli – I think it was called Bagnoli, and it was a suburb of Naples.</span> <span id="s1943">And the mayor, his wife, would cook this – she was a great spaghetti cook.</span> <span id="s1944">Good, wonderful sauce.</span> <span id="s1945">You know, there wasn’t much meat around, so – and we got tired of our rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: And our own cooks.</span> <span id="s1948">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Where – where did the lira come from?</span> <span id="s1950">How did you have spending money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: What the what came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: The lira, where did it come from?</span> <span id="s1953">How did you have spending money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Lira was printed in the United States.</span> <span id="s1955">It was all occupation money.</span> <span id="s1956">The original lira became – where it was – I think if I’m – I’m not so – don’t quite remember how it was handled, but I think that was turned in, it was in France.</span> <span id="s1957">It was all occupation money that was printed by the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Now you were in Italy between when and when?</span> <span id="s1959">What are the dates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: 1943, September, October, and until 1940 – until May, June – May or June 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: And during this period, you didn’t see much fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: No.</span> <span id="s1963">I saw some, but not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: And there – there weren’t any incidents where – where there was some sort of attack on your unit, a hostile environment, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: No, just some bombings.</span> <span id="s1966">Some planes got through, German planes.</span> <span id="s1967">That wasn’t – you ran.</span> <span id="s1968">There were – we always had some protection, some bomb shelters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Were there any friendships between the G.I.s and the locals, or were you moving too fast for anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1971">There were friendships – not friendships, no.</span> <span id="s1972">And that’s what bothered me somewhat, and I think maybe I had an extraordinary sensitivity to that.</span> <span id="s1973">The Germans – the – the – the Italians were – the G.I.s called them guineas or wops.</span> <span id="s1974">They called the Germans krauts, they called the French, the frogs, and I – bothered me a great deal.</span> <span id="s1975">It was insulting.</span> <span id="s1976">And I always wondered – that was the one minus that I always felt that we did not do a good job to – in other words, the American G.I. had a great sense of superiority, emotionally, and looked down on almost anybody that wasn’t American.</span> <span id="s1977">And I was sensitive to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: And you were not partaking in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: No.</span> <span id="s1980">I – I felt I could not call an Italian with any kind of a name but Italian.</span> <span id="s1981">Same thing I didn’t call any German a kraut.</span> <span id="s1982">It was – I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s1983">My son-in-law, married to our youngest daughter, who is dean of this law school in – they’re Californian, and his father, my son-in-law’s dad, was a major or colonel in the tank corps.</span> <span id="s1984">And he divorced – they divorced – in other words, my – had five children and he divorced his wife, in California, and married a German woman.</span> <span id="s1985">And we used to see them occasionally, you know, when we went to California we’d see the mother, and then we’d see the father, you know.</span> <span id="s1986">I don’t know if I make myself clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: And he used to call his wife the kraut.</span> <span id="s1989">She was born in Germany, and she was a war bride.</span> <span id="s1990">It always bothered me and I once – I’d never really – I was going to talk to him about this, but I never really felt I wanted to get into that kind of involvement.</span> <span id="s1991">So, I felt the same way, that I didn’t want to diminish people’s – what – cultural background, even though they were the enemies, I didn’t – they were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: And kraut does – somehow did not really fit their ch – in my opinion, they were – they were – they were Germans.</span> <span id="s1994">They were – I – the concentration camps were – guards were Germans, the Nazis were Germans.</span> <span id="s1995">And if would call them krauts, I would somehow diminish their – even their evil –</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: – of what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: I don’t know if I make myself clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2001">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: So I looked at them as who they were.</span> <span id="s2003">I interrogated some, when they needed someone to speak to a prisoner or two.</span> <span id="s2004">And everybody told me they weren’t Nazis.</span> <span id="s2005">I never found a Nazi.</span> <span id="s2006">But they all lied.</span> <span id="s2007">They were always very [indecipherable] but I did the – later on, toward – when I was in Austria I did interrogate some SS people.</span> <span id="s2008">So that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: And I do want – I do want to talk about that more, but let’s just – let’s just finish the Italian chapter then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: In Italy, you’re there until May or June of ’44, and – okay, so what happens in May or June?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: In what?</span> <span id="s2013">May or June?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2015">Wha – how do you leave [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: You mean when the war ended?</span> <span id="s2017">When?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Well, at wh-wha – when – when do you leave Italy, and for what reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s2020">I was in northern Italy, I moved up from Naples, from – into some other town, two little towns, I don’t even remember their names.</span> <span id="s2021">And when the war ended, I was much in northern Italy, not far from the Po River, and I forget the little town that we were in.</span> <span id="s2022">I wish I’d remember, and I didn’t keep records of these things.</span> <span id="s2023">And I remember [indecipherable] for some reason I – we – I landed up before that at – at the Adriatic, and I have to look at the map to see what the name of the town was that I was in, because most of the time I was over of the Mediterranean part of Italy.</span> <span id="s2024">So I get pulled out of my outfit, and get into a – and I don’t quite remember all that, how – where I landed up, it’s someplace that I disliked the master sergeant that seemed to have no combat experience or any else, had just come from the u – from the States.</span> <span id="s2025">He was a regular army guy, never really participated in any of the combat situations [indecipherable] it all back, and he just had come to northern Italy.</span> <span id="s2026">And he tried to tell all these guys that had been there for two years or more how they should behave, you know, like back in the States, very G.I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: Now was it – was it a behavior – was it a discipline, or was it fraternizing –</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: Discipline, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: Discipline?</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: – get up in the morning and stand at attention and count off numbers and things he didn’t do any more, things that were done in basic training.</span> <span id="s2031">And this guy, this master sergeant insisted on it.</span> <span id="s2032">So it was a lot of – a lot of complaints about it, and they finally stopped it and they kind of got rid of this guy.</span> <span id="s2033">And I waited there for – and I wasn’t quite sure what my assignment was going to be, when I heard I was now part of US forces in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Now, prior –</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: But before that my –</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: – prior to that, you had never been asked to used your German for the arm –</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Prior to that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: They never used – they never, ever – this is the first time that my IBM card came up –</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: – with that information apparently, because otherwise I would have gone with my outfit and left Italy when the war ended.</span> <span id="s2042">So I land up, and they tell me I am now part of General Mark Clark, who was the commanding general, of whom I knew his aides because I traveled with them most of the time in Italy, the headquarters of the Fifth Army.</span> <span id="s2043">That’s where I was ass – really originally assigned to.</span> <span id="s2044">So it was kind of surprising to me.</span> <span id="s2045">And once I get an order and tell that I’m – we’re going into – travel into Salzburg, which is a beautiful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Had you ever been there as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: No.</span> <span id="s2048">My friend Irving was – has been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: And he was with you during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: No, no, but he came – he – he wou – he would come for two hours, or three hours, or four hours.</span> <span id="s2051">And he tells me, here’s what you’re going to do in Salzburg, you know, boom, boom, boom, because every – the Salzburg Festival are held every summer, and the Vienna Philharmonic goes there and plays.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: And they have opera, you know, it’s the birthplace of Mozart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: So he tells me, oh, you’re going to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s2056">Why am I going to Salzburg?</span> <span id="s2057">Because we’re negotiating with the Russians, and according to the Potsdam treaty, the United States and Great Britain and France and Russia’s supposed to administer and be the occupation forces for two cities: Berlin and Vienna.</span> <span id="s2058">And the Russians were not going to let – they were playing possum with us, and possum, and they would not let us in, and from what I understood at that time, that they had not paid their troops for three years, four years.</span> <span id="s2059">And they –</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: They would not let you in where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: That was in nine – in May of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: And they would not let you in where, exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: That was in – that was, at that time, in Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: So – but they were not letting you go to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: No, they were at a place called Enz, on the Enz River, and Linz and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Okay, and they weren’t letting you go towards Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: No, they was – the – Austria was occ – it was separated, it was – I’m sorry, it was divided between – I’m trying to remember the British – I think the British had a piece of it, we had a piece of it.</span> <span id="s2068">We were – north of Linz into Salzburg, was all American.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Other parts were British, and little parts were French and most – and Vienna was all under the Russians.</span> <span id="s2071">And if – from what I understand, it’s never been publicized that we gave – you see, everything at that time in Europe had printed money – had money printed in Baltimore, occupational money.</span> <span id="s2072">Th-The local money was withdrawn and not worth anything, or – and occupation money became the – the a – is what you traded in.</span> <span id="s2073">So we apparently gave them a truckload of printed money –</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Them being –</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: – occupation money, and they let it, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Who is them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: – we – I – I mean, I love Salzburg, I – for a short time I stayed at this unbelievable chateau [indecipherable] we almost got kicked out, the G.I.s did, cause Mark Clark took it over.</span> <span id="s2078">And it’s now a si – it used – Arthur Miller, you know, the playwright –</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: – used to have a school there of a dramat – drama and it’s now owned by some American foundation.</span> <span id="s2081">And a friend of mine’s wife was a professor here at Drake University and now retired, went there for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Do you know the name of the chateau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: No.</span> <span id="s2084">It wasn’t Mirabell(ph), which is a Mozart thing, and I don’t know what it’s called now, and I – I have to really go into my computer to figure out the name of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: Absolutely gorgeous.</span> <span id="s2087">I didn’t stay there long, about a couple weeks –</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: So, you – you get into Austria, you get to Salzburg, you get to that chateau, what is going through your mind that you’re back in Austria, what – what are you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2090">Yes, I – I mean, it’s almost indescribable.</span> <span id="s2091">I mean, the emotional – never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that that – that was – that would happen to me.</span> <span id="s2092">That where I got – I couldn’t sit in a – in a park bench in Vienna, I could not ride the tr – the trolley, I couldn’t go to a movie, and here all of a sudden I’m the conquering hero in Austria, walking around like I own the joint.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: What – what – what were you and your unit doing, by the way, during the days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: You were waiting for orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Waiting for orders to see –</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: And wer – did you have a lot of freedom to move around?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2099">I gave you a – I’ll give you a little anecdote, happened.</span> <span id="s2100">So my – who shows up?</span> <span id="s2101">My friend Irving.</span> <span id="s2102">So he knows – he knows the surrounding.</span> <span id="s2103">He – they used to come every summer they – they have rented a place because his father played at the orchestra.</span> <span id="s2104">And so I get this whole history about Mozart and everything that really was important and what house he lived in, and the Mozarteum, and we go to the library, and we see things I’ve never expected to see, you know, going back 500 years.</span> <span id="s2105">And – and one day we go into a little shop to send – get some postcards to send home.</span> <span id="s2106">And he pulls out of – we look at these postcards, quite old, and he pulls out one postcard, and it’s Toscanini.</span> <span id="s2107">You know who he is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: You – you know who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Hello?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Yes, yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2114">He was probably the most famous conductor in the world at one time.</span> <span id="s2115">He conducted the NBCs Philharmonic, the symphony.</span> <span id="s2116">He was the – if you go and look up – go to Google and look up a Toscanini, you’ll be – there wasn’t – nobody’s ever been suppersed(ph) – sup – really has got the fame that he had as a conductor, Italian fellow.</span> <span id="s2117">So he is conducting – no, he’s rehearsing – on this postcard, he’s rehearsing the Vienna Philharmonic.</span> <span id="s2118">And there are people in shirtsleeves, and there are people standing around on the periphery of this orchestra.</span> <span id="s2119">And my friend Irving pulls it out and he shows me one of the peoples – boys, he was like 14 years old, or 13 years old, was him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: Is that [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s2122">So, when I was</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Did he buy the postcard?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: Yes, he bought it.</span> <span id="s2125">I looked for others, but it’s the only one where he had.</span> <span id="s2126">So I went – I was a – three years ago I was with two friends, I was in Munich and Berlin and I stopped over in – in – in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s2127">I went to that little shop, and this little old lady, and this little old guy, still in that same shi – same people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: And I went through again, trying to find another postcard like that, but I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2130">I spent about a half hour going through their inventory.</span> <span id="s2131">So, it was a very fascinating, to me, you know?</span> <span id="s2132">So here we are, and finally get orders to drive with another guy, we had our own Jeep, to drive into Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: One more question before – before we get to the part where you get back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: Wa – I do have one more question before we get to the part where you get to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: In Salzburg, I’m guessing you are interacting with the locals cause you have the freedom to move around and you speak the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: What is your sense from them?</span> <span id="s2140">How are they reacting to you as an American, and how are you react – reacting to them as Austrians?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: I acted like an American.</span> <span id="s2142">I didn’t speak German, I wouldn’t speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Unless I had to.</span> <span id="s2145">I had this – and I’m ashamed to tell you this, because things change, that I truly – I was a – I’d lorded it over them.</span> <span id="s2146">I’m a conqueror.</span> <span id="s2147">They kicked me out.</span> <span id="s2148">You know, this is a terrible, hurtful thing for us.</span> <span id="s2149">My father was in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: We took – you know, we saw what happened to Austria, we see how the Austrians responded and what they did to the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: And when you say you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: So I had this, you know, this feeling, and it translated itself, I think, in my behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: How – how did it translate itself?</span> <span id="s2155">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Well, I – you know, I never told people that I’m Austrian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: I was an American, period.</span> <span id="s2159">That’s how far it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: But was there anything else that you did that was – where you used your position?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: No, I – I just – I’m like an observer.</span> <span id="s2162">Really, you know, I was a – I wasn’t even officer, I was a s – you know, I was a sergeant.</span> <span id="s2163">And so I didn’t have much authority.</span> <span id="s2164">I had enough authority because of my uniform, and it was – you know, it – that was enough.</span> <span id="s2165">So you had to be pretty careful about yourself, that it didn’t run away with – with – with it.</span> <span id="s2166">It wa – it’s very difficult, I think, to describe what it feels like to be a conqueror, or to be in a foreign country, even though to me it wasn’t – Salzburg was no longer my country, it was – I’m an American.</span> <span id="s2167">And that was very important to me, to make this distinction.</span> <span id="s2168">And I looked at it like an observer.</span> <span id="s2169">I didn’t have a feeling any more for being a native of Austria, or have a sense of pride.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: Did the Austrians –</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Did the Austri – did the Austrians fear the Americans?</span> <span id="s2173">Was this – was there any kind of sense that they were worried about what was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: No?</span> <span id="s2175">You mean, the Americans, or the – the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: The – the – the Austrians, the locals around Salzburg.</span> <span id="s2177">Was there any feeling –</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: Well, there was [indecipherable] yes, they were very – I think they were very vulnerable.</span> <span id="s2179">The ec – the economics were pretty bad.</span> <span id="s2180">Food was not easily available.</span> <span id="s2181">The – the natives kind of did not really have a high profile, they kind of stuck to their homes.</span> <span id="s2182">And you know, they saw the Nazis behavior.</span> <span id="s2183">And I think there was a certain amount of submerged – whatever they tell you that they didn’t know what was going on with the concentration camps and the gassing and all this, they knew it.</span> <span id="s2184">So, I think in their own psyche, they felt this basic sense of insecurity, because the German army, and the Austrian army, though it really was really part of the German army – and you know, if you go back in the history, more Austrians were associated with the concentration camps than Germans.</span> <span id="s2185">They were probably the worst anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s2186">So you felt very, very – I think they were – they themselves knew what they did, and kept a low, low profile.</span> <span id="s2187">And so, I really – my opportunity to talk to local people was really not that big.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2189">Were there any American G.I.s who were somehow using their status or their power for nefarious goals?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2191">The – there – there was no questioning about the occupation.</span> <span id="s2192">The United States moved in there very – with lock, stock and barrel.</span> <span id="s2193">I mean, we had everything.</span> <span id="s2194">We had food, we had – you know, had PXs, we had – we took over the best hotels.</span> <span id="s2195">We were – we were the conquerors.</span> <span id="s2196">And we had strong feelings of superiority, subconsciously and consciously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: And di –</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: So we made these people feel pretty small, you know, that’s – and they if – and the worse they behaved during the war, I think the more afraid they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Was there any fraternization with Austrian women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Yes, some.</span> <span id="s2201">Wer – I never had any.</span> <span id="s2202">I’m trying to think why I never had any.</span> <span id="s2203">I hand a girlfriend at home, and I was corresponding with her almost on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s2204">You know [indecipherable] V – V-letters.</span> <span id="s2205">She’s – my wife is a very wonderful writer.</span> <span id="s2206">She has a fantastic ability.</span> <span id="s2207">She really should have been an author.</span> <span id="s2208">She never really pursued it, but she wrote the most beautiful letters.</span> <span id="s2209">So I really was very much in love with her.</span> <span id="s2210">And so really I had no – ever had any kind of relationship with any woman.</span> <span id="s2211">I’m trying to think – not even, you know, I spoke the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: And I never – I never – never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s2214">And the other thing, I think – okay, I will tell you a story that – well, I don’t know if I should really – okay.</span> <span id="s2215">The – the – somehow, I had a sense of – was it discipline or morals or ethics, or whatever you may want to call it, instilled to me by my parents.</span> <span id="s2216">There was no deviation.</span> <span id="s2217">I never messed around with any woman.</span> <span id="s2218">And – except one time.</span> <span id="s2219">And that later came, before going home, that I had to get up on ship – I mean, I had no – no relationships, but I got involved into a situation in Marseilles, France, which was very strange.</span> <span id="s2220">Now, if we have time I’ll tell you about it –</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Oh, we have plenty of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: – and promise not to put it into my biography.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: Because it was so unusual, yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: And – and my wife, you know, everybody, all of my friends know that story, my wife knows the story.</span> <span id="s2227">But anyways, up to that time, there wasn’t anything that – that really I felt was – somehow it never appeared, I – I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s2228">I can remember why I never had any attraction to any of the German or Austrian women, or Italian women.</span> <span id="s2229">I did make the acquaintances of one Jewish woman in Naples, and she was a violinist, and the only thing that we had was my love for music and her talent.</span> <span id="s2230">And I went to her – with her a few – she was Jewish and she was a violinist and she gave recitals, and I went with her while I stayed in Naples, up to a few of her recitals.</span> <span id="s2231">And that was a f – one woman that I met and I helped her out a little bit with food, what they were very short on at that particular time, with her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: In Salzburg, were there G.I.s helping out the local Austrians with food, or was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Oh yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s2234">The – the women in Austria, particularly in Vienna.</span> <span id="s2235">Vienna was starved for men, because they either were in prisons, they were in stalags, or they were in – killed.</span> <span id="s2236">And it was a shortage of male people when I got into Vienna.</span> <span id="s2237">The G.I.s were just having a ball.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: So let’s talk about getting into Vienna.</span> <span id="s2239">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: So, the Russians finally said okay, you come in.</span> <span id="s2241">So that time was springtime, and my – one of my – and I can’t – a-all I remember, this guy and I were assigned to this Jeep, or this Jeep was assigned to us.</span> <span id="s2242">And we were in Linz at that time, which was the border between – we were waiting for the opportunity to get into – across the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s2243">And they finally – th – we negotiated that – I didn’t, but you know, the army did, and got the signal to drive into Vienna and to take over certain da – I got places, and a list of places that we should take over, at which hotel we should stay, and some apartments that were at one time held by some Nazi functionaries, to take over for our incoming troops.</span> <span id="s2244">And only about 200 Americans to be – that were going into the first occupation.</span> <span id="s2245">I think that’s what the number was, but don’t pin me down on it, but I don’t quite remember.</span> <span id="s2246">So we got into our Jeep and got our stuff in the back.</span> <span id="s2247">And I remember picking up a – a Russian officer, and we offered him some cognac, and he – I think he drank that whole bottle, we just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2248">And we got into Vienna at about – oh, must have been after lunch, something like one o’clock or so, and the place was very few people.</span> <span id="s2249">What happened as we drove through the – from the suburbs in, that every time there was some people walking and they saw us, they would duck into the closest building, where the doors were open maybe, you know, the gates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Apparently, they thought we – we didn’t have much – I don’t think we had any American flag painted on our Jeep, or our uniforms didn’t – weren’t very recognizable.</span> <span id="s2252">I wore fatigues, so did my buddy.</span> <span id="s2253">And I had my helmet packed in a bag, in my barracks bag, and – and on our way in I say to this fellow in the camp, he was from – near Cincinnati – Covington – coving – Covington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2254">I says, I want to take you to my old neighborhood where I grew up.</span> <span id="s2255">Want to do that?</span> <span id="s2256">He says, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2257">So we – we – we kind of turned the Jeep into that direction.</span> <span id="s2258">It’s like the suburb – not suburb, but next to the first district was where our district was, not far walking distance to where the opera is, and the Ringstrasse – you ever been in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: Have you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2262">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: You did?</span> <span id="s2264">So, not far.</span> <span id="s2265">Even though it’s the 20th district, it was very close to the first district.</span> <span id="s2266">We drive up on our street where our buil – where we sh – we s – lived in an apartment house, and didn’t see a soul.</span> <span id="s2267">And there’s certain – several buildings had been shelled.</span> <span id="s2268">There were holes in them, big ones, and probably nobody living in them.</span> <span id="s2269">But my – our building was not damaged, and – and the buildings across the street were not damaged.</span> <span id="s2270">And we pulled our Jeep up, and it – when places have been shelled, that – kind of a funny silence, there’s no birds singing, or things like that, and it was spring – it was late spring, the beginning of summer, I think.</span> <span id="s2271">And we pulled up, and I showed this guy, my buddy what – second floor up here, he look up and that’s where our apartment was.</span> <span id="s2272">I wonder if we can go in there, in the building, then – maybe the front – the gate was open, and see who lives there, who took over our apartment, and – and what it looks like.</span> <span id="s2273">And just about when we’re discussing this, and no people, this place is empty, a woman comes out of the building that we lived in, and she’s carrying a pail.</span> <span id="s2274">And there’s, across the street from the building, an – a lot of cobblestones in Vienna, and – it’s an old city.</span> <span id="s2275">And she keeps her head down, because she sees these two soldiers sitting in this open Jeep, and there have been a lot of rapes before we got there, by the Russians [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2276">But she’s an elderly woman.</span> <span id="s2277">And keeps her head down, but she looks – turns it and looks at us, and I had my – I don’t have my hat on.</span> <span id="s2278">I recognize her, who she was.</span> <span id="s2279">She was a neighbor of ours.</span> <span id="s2280">And she looks, and all of a sudden, she drops the pail [music – phone ringing] who is this?</span> <span id="s2281">That’s my wife, hold on a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: Yeah, Mickie(ph)?</span> <span id="s2284">Hello?</span> <span id="s2285">Yes, I’m still on the ph – yes, I’m – we’re getting close, okay?</span> <span id="s2286">All right.</span> <span id="s2287">Yes, so be – I know, okay, all right.</span> <span id="s2288">She’s telling me I’m tying up the phone.</span> <span id="s2289">Okay, I know.</span> <span id="s2290">Anyways, we get this – wrong part for her to do it.</span> <span id="s2291">Well, we’re going to conclude.</span> <span id="s2292">So anyways, she looks and recognizes me – and I have curly hair – and she drops the pail and screams my name.</span> <span id="s2293">And all of a sudden – and she comes rushing over to me, and starts hugging and kissing me, and – and all of a sudden the street fills up with, I don’t know, hundreds – hundred – I don’t know, lots of people.</span> <span id="s2294">They all kissing me and hugging me and my God, then where is my mom and my dad, and where are the Schtolzenbergs(ph), which is another Jewish family lived in that building, and they knew they were – they left for the United States much before us.</span> <span id="s2295">And – oh, and Walter is here.</span> <span id="s2296">That’s a guy I used to play with when I was very young, his grandmother lived in that same building, he used to come and visit.</span> <span id="s2297">He had just come out of a prison camp.</span> <span id="s2298">American stalag.</span> <span id="s2299">And – and so he came down, and I didn’t know what to say to him, and vice versa.</span> <span id="s2300">I gave away everything I had, like rations and – K-rations, or whatever I had, and said, I’ll be back.</span> <span id="s2301">I never went back.</span> <span id="s2302">I went back many years later, s – not – maybe 10 years later, and my mother sent me a bunch of money, I should give – she gave me a bunch of names, and I should give out money to some neighbors that were very supportive of us.</span> <span id="s2303">Which I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2304">And I found them, and I start – I gave them like hundred dollar bills.</span> <span id="s2305">They really were very sup – most appreciative with us.</span> <span id="s2306">So I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: So this – this welcome, if – if I understand correctly, this shocked you?</span> <span id="s2308">Or you weren’t quite sure how to react?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Yes, correct.</span> <span id="s2310">It’s kind of a love-hate, or hate-love, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2311">I don’t know, maybe that’s the wrong term, but it was things that, you know, where were you?</span> <span id="s2312">Where were they when we needed them?</span> <span id="s2313">But they couldn’t help themselves.</span> <span id="s2314">So, they always wanted to know how are my dad, and how is my mom, and what’s going on, and so – how did I come, and I’m an American soldier.</span> <span id="s2315">And they treated me like I was, you know, the Prince of Wales, or President Roosevelt, or whoever.</span> <span id="s2316">It was – and then I said, I’ll be back, I’ll be – but I never gone.</span> <span id="s2317">And I went, did some foolish things.</span> <span id="s2318">I remember that I used to hang out in a place called the Augarten – Ausarten(ph) – Augarten, which was next to my gymnasium, and where kids would hang out.</span> <span id="s2319">And then when the Nazis took over, they put the graffiti on every bench, no Jews allowed, you know, Juden verboten.</span> <span id="s2320">Couldn’t sit on a park bench.</span> <span id="s2321">So I went back there, I think I sat on 20 different benches.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: My God, the people thought I was nuts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: But this was much later, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: Yes, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: So that’s kind of – I really wanted to come – go home, I had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: How long – how – how – how many months are we talking about right now in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Maybe three to four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Three, four?</span> <span id="s2331">And do you know di – can you tell me approximately which months those were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Yes, it’s – I think it started like June, May or June, and I came home at Christmastime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2334">So y-you were a whole half a year in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: But I didn’t come home – in other words, I didn’t stay in Vienna all this time.</span> <span id="s2336">I was – I f – I went to France, I went to Belgium and France, and I – staging area, and embar – port of embarkation waiting for a ship, and I landed up in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s2337">I found my mother’s sister in Brussels.</span> <span id="s2338">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: Goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: – and another sister-in-law of my mother in Brussels, whose husband got incarcerated and died in one of the con – in Dachau – no ca – not in Dachau, in buch – in – forgotten which camp it was now.</span> <span id="s2341">And so, it wasn’t until after the war that I – my mother and I, I went – I made a few trips to Israel, my mother mi – I think she got an award from El Al for all the trips she made to Israel.</span> <span id="s2342">She had a sister lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s2343">And I was – I think I made five to six trips to Israel.</span> <span id="s2344">And I found some people there, my [indecipherable] girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2345">She was 16 and I was 16.</span> <span id="s2346">So then I finally got home.</span> <span id="s2347">In Marseilles I had some experience that were somewhat funny.</span> <span id="s2348">And if you promise not to put it into my biography, I’ll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: It was – I was waiting in Marseilles, and just actually waiting for – I don’t know for how long, because there was so many people going home, and so few ships.</span> <span id="s2351">So we had what’s called a s – they had cigarette camps.</span> <span id="s2352">They were – camps were called Pall Mall, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, all after cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2353">And they were big camps, were all staging areas, you know.</span> <span id="s2354">We had several million G.I.s in Europe, they had all – they had – all had to come home.</span> <span id="s2355">And one day a few guys came in, and they said they want to go to Marseilles, and I said I have no interest.</span> <span id="s2356">And they said well, we want to check out a weapons’ carrier, and a Jeep, then we can’t check it out with you.</span> <span id="s2357">Without me.</span> <span id="s2358">So I succumbed to the things, and I didn’t realize that the jees – well, I knew that the – three of those guys were made – had to – made the invasion of Marseilles with the 42nd division, and they knew the town.</span> <span id="s2359">And I said, I’ll go to go in, but what are you guys – I’m going to go and find – if I find some museum, or find a synagogue or something that I – I was always interested in art, and see what the town looked like, and always remember Charles Boyer, about France and Marseilles, and anyways, he was a big movie star at one time, and so – French – so I went, and the first thing, that was in the morning, early, they want to go to the house of prostitution.</span> <span id="s2360">Well, not me.</span> <span id="s2361">I said, I’m not going, I’ll drop you guys off, and I’ll pick you up in an hour, an hour and a half, whatever.</span> <span id="s2362">So, this is nine o’clock in the morning, and they’re knocking on our door, and it’s – that time, prostitution was legalized in France until we came, the Americans, and made it illegal.</span> <span id="s2363">But – so this place was one of the legalized places, and they had signs outside, off-limits, and out of bounds for the British, that’s what they said.</span> <span id="s2364">We said off-limits, you couldn’t go in, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: Who – who said that it was off-limits?</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: Which authority said it was off-limits, who put the signs out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: The – the British put down – we put on off-limits, and the British put down out of bounds.</span> <span id="s2369">That’s what they call it, we call it –</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2371">So which – which sign was it, was if off-limits or out of bounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: Both, both signs, both [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: Both.</span> <span id="s2374">So American G.I.s were not supposed to frequent the house, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2376">And neither do – neither were the – neither were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: British.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: – British.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: But they’re banging on the door, and I’m sitting in that weapons carrier, and waiting to see what time they want me to come back, there’s – coming across the street, they say – you gotta come.</span> <span id="s2381">Why?</span> <span id="s2382">We need 10 people like a million.</span> <span id="s2383">But i – what do you need 10 people?</span> <span id="s2384">Well, they got a show.</span> <span id="s2385">And we – they don’t want to put it on unless they have 10 and you’re the number 10.</span> <span id="s2386">So I go in and they put on a porno sh – girls – they wake up the girls and they – they all lived there.</span> <span id="s2387">It was like Marlene Dietrich was in that place, you know, the – the lampshades had little strings around them, and – and they had an old Victrola that you had to wind up, and they had these couches.</span> <span id="s2388">And I had a sat – I had not sat on a couch for two years.</span> <span id="s2389">So I sat there, you know, the girls come over and they try to entice you, and so it was all a si – to make a long story short, I decided I behaved myself for two years, I’m not gonna go get a venereal disease or get [indecipherable] and how will I explain it to my – which I hope will be my fiancée, and tell the story?</span> <span id="s2390">Finally, they start drinking, they were selling cognac, and – and I’m ready to go and one of – one of the guys gets drunk.</span> <span id="s2391">Big fellow, and – but that time he sees no evil, and I finally convince him to get out of there.</span> <span id="s2392">Some girls – some guys check – you know, shacked up with these girls.</span> <span id="s2393">Didn’t take very long, and we’re carrying out this one guy who had – so drunk he couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s2394">And we went back to camp, okay?</span> <span id="s2395">End of story.</span> <span id="s2396">Not the real end of story.</span> <span id="s2397">Twenty-five or 30 years later, I’m in – in – I live in Des Moines, and maybe was longer than that, and this is a group that I have never known – never heard of Des Moines when I was in Marseilles, I never heard of Iowa.</span> <span id="s2398">I lived in New York City, right?</span> <span id="s2399">And you know, I came to New York, I lived in New York, I went to school in New York, I had hoped to stay in New York, and never heard of Iowa.</span> <span id="s2400">So I’m in – back in – maybe 34 years – 30 years later, maybe more.</span> <span id="s2401">And I’m in charge – I think I was president of the federation, or something, or – anyways, I’m in charge of the Holocaust Memorial Service.</span> <span id="s2402">I think I was somehow either vice president or president of the federation.</span> <span id="s2403">And – Jewish federation.</span> <span id="s2404">So somebody says to me, I should guy – call a guy – oh, no, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2405">I’m sorry, I got the story wrong.</span> <span id="s2406">I’m going to a – a national convention, Saint Louis, representing Des Moines, I was president of the federation here, of the GA, general – it’s called the General Assembly of all the Jewish communities that meet once a year, the officers.</span> <span id="s2407">And this is in Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s2408">And I had some good customers in Saint Louis, who – whose owner – one of the owners of this manufacturing company was also president of the Jewish Federation of Saint Louis, and I was of the Jewish Federation in Des Moines.</span> <span id="s2409">So we’re business colleagues, and they were my customers and he calls me up and he says, I want you [indecipherable] and I’m there, you know, at the convention.</span> <span id="s2410">We’re having a Friday night Shabbat dinner, and I want you to come, and I want you to meet some other people.</span> <span id="s2411">Okay, there were about 12 people there, one of which was – this is before the Holocaust Museum was – they were just planning it.</span> <span id="s2412">I think the government had just given land to it.</span> <span id="s2413">And one of the persons there – there were some well-known Jewish people there at the dinner, and one of the persons there was – and I can’t remember his name, and he says to me – we’re talking, and he was in charge of the – I think this was during Carter’s administration, that the land was given by the government to the Jewish community to build the Holocaust Museum on the mall.</span> <span id="s2414">And he was, at the time, the person responsible for getting the planning done and everything else.</span> <span id="s2415">Not the – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: He’s a well-known – and I can’t remember his name, but a well-known person in the Jewish commun – in Jewish national affairs.</span> <span id="s2418">And we talking, and having this conversation, and he says to me, oh, you’re from Des Moines?</span> <span id="s2419">He says oh, you know, we have done – we have a project.</span> <span id="s2420">This is gonna be part of the museum, that we have con – trying to contact every G.I. that had something to do with the liberation – not G.I., but every soldier had something to do with the liberation of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2421">And one fellow was one of the first pers – into Dachau, the liberation, and he’s never forgotten it, is from Iowa.</span> <span id="s2422">And he is – his story is so powerful, we brought him to Washington to record it.</span> <span id="s2423">And he’s gotten on televi – on NBC, and – and he’s – that his – now has – he’s in insurance – he’s in insurance business.</span> <span id="s2424">But he was so impacted by what he saw of Dachau that he spends all his time making speeches about it.</span> <span id="s2425">It is just – it’s his most important thing of his life right now.</span> <span id="s2426">He lives in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and he gave me his name.</span> <span id="s2427">And he says, if you ever have something, you know, about the Holocaust, in the memorial, or you do it once a year, remembrance day, call him up and get him to speak.</span> <span id="s2428">You’ll have a – a speaker you will not forget, because he tells about the first few moments when he got into Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Do you remember his name?</span> <span id="s2430">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2431">It’ll come to me as I talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: Okay.</span>

York?</span> <span id="s2453">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s2454">And you were – and he gives me the outfit.</span> <span id="s2455">He was with the 42nd division.</span> <span id="s2456">And then he says to me, do you remember me?</span> <span id="s2457">I said no.</span> <span id="s2458">He says, you’re the guy that carried me out of the whorehouse in Marseilles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2461">I couldn’t – I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2462">Oh my God, and then when he starts talking, I remember it.</span> <span id="s2463">He says, I’m the guy that got so drunk, and you know, he said, but don’t tell my wife.</span> <span id="s2464">Hank – Hank – I’ll ask Mickie(ph), I’ll go before this is over, and I’ll give you the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: He died a year ago, they had an article in the paper.</span> <span id="s2467">So he and I became friends again.</span> <span id="s2468">He came to one of the affairs, and spoke at the temple.</span> <span id="s2469">And then we had a thing on nonec – ecumenical, and for the whole

the same place and un – it’s just unreal how fate works.</span> <span id="s2483">And carrying him and – out and taking him back to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: Incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: It’s incredible, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">Q: Incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2488">Okay, so here I was in France with the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: But I think we – we skipped through Vienna a little quickly, because I didn’t get to hear about what you were actually doing at –</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">A: Okay, that was the out – that was pretty my – that was – I felt very uncomfortable in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: I just wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s2493">It somehow reproduced memories, and I knew how – how bad the Nazis were.</span> <span id="s2494">I tried to find some Jewish people when I was in Vienna.</span> <span id="s2495">I think there may have been maybe 10 or 12, or maybe 20, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: How did you find it, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: – they were just trying to get a community going, and they were this – they weren’t even from Vienna.</span> <span id="s2498">I did meet one – I was back there a few years later.</span> <span id="s2499">I was skiing in – in Innsbruck, in the mountains, and I – then somehow, I don’t know why, we did go to Vienna for a few days, couple of days, I think, and I ran into a Jewish ski instructor, young man.</span> <span id="s2500">And he told me at that time that there wasn’t hardly any Jews, he stay – he was hidden during the war, or not hidden [indecipherable] didn’t know – people didn’t know he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2501">And there hardly – I don’t think there were any hard – hardly any Jews left, out of the 245,000.</span> <span id="s2502">So we got out just in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: And I – from then on it was mass transportation out of there, into concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: Actually, when – when do you recall hearing about this first?</span> <span id="s2506">When do you recall realizing the enormity of what had happened to the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: Yes, yes, I – I – trying to think.</span> <span id="s2508">It had to be – I lived with it, because of my relatives.</span> <span id="s2509">But we never knew – never knew the en – well, we knew the enormity because the people all disappeared.</span> <span id="s2510">I had a grandfather that disap – that I don’t – never met, I never saw, or a couple of uncles.</span> <span id="s2511">And I found my mother’s sister, who per – was supposed to – said she was the housekeeper, but I think she may have been the mistress of the – one of the – the Supreme Court Justices at – in – in Belgium, who left her this palatial home, right smack on the – what was it, Rue de Justice in Brussels.</span> <span id="s2512">And I met my other, and I found my other co – I found a cousin who lived through it.</span> <span id="s2513">I ran into my first girlfriend, I – I mean, I never ran into her, I found her in – in Canada, and she told me how she was s-smuggled over the mountains, the Alps, into Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: But – but I’m guessing these people surfaced a little bit later, so this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: Yes, all later, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: – we’re talking about ’46 - ’47, possibly even to the 50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Yes, well, later than that, probably in the 1950s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: So – so when – so in – in ’45, when you’re – you’re still in – in Vienna, how much of this is really sinking in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: Quite a bit, because I wanted out of there.</span> <span id="s2522">I couldn’t wait to get out.</span> <span id="s2523">I just hated every moment I lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: But you hated every moment because – because of what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: The history, and what I heard, and what was going on, there were no Jews left, and I could not inter – I could not interact very much with the Viennese.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2527">Did they try to interact with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: I found it very – I found it very difficult, yes, emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: Did they try to interact with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">A: Yes, well, I had a powerful posi – not powerful, I had a – an important position, and I was in charge of the – the post office, and the PX.</span> <span id="s2531">Officer came to me one day and he said, you know, you do – you do – you – you the only guy here that – that people could send money through.</span> <span id="s2532">Which is true, was true.</span> <span id="s2533">And there was a lot of black market going on, big time.</span> <span id="s2534">You buy s – carton of cigarettes for 50 cents, and you sold it for t – for a hundred dollars, or 200 dollars, in all occupation money.</span> <span id="s2535">I just give you an idea of that.</span> <span id="s2536">So all of this was such an unnatural situation; things that I didn’t want to be involved with.</span> <span id="s2537">And – and I had these responsibilities, and I wanted out, and I want to go home, I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2538">I just couldn’t wait to go back to the States.</span> <span id="s2539">And I saw – I saw Vienna naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: Meaning that I saw its real character.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: What – what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: Anti-Semitic, hated Jews.</span> <span id="s2544">They worst – I think they were worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s2545">I have a good friend, he always jokes to me about it, he says Vienna is a beautiful city, there’s only one thing wrong.</span> <span id="s2546">What’s that?</span> <span id="s2547">Vien – the Viennese.</span> <span id="s2548">And to this very dear – very day I think there is – anti-Semitism is still very strong in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: Were you – were you seeing any instances of this in – in the immediate post-war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2551">I didn’t see it, but I felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s2553">What – what – what kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: I – I had been – I had been in Vienna a few times and I’d taken two by – I had ridden my bikes twice, from Germany into Vienna on a bike path along the Danube.</span> <span id="s2555">And I’ve taken a group of people from Des Moines twice.</span> <span id="s2556">And somehow – it’s maybe me, it may not be them, that I have this oversensitivity, the amount of – of vulnerability, and I don’t feel – I just don’t – I feel so – I, you know, I live in a community of 450,000 - 500,000 people, and about 1200 Jewish families here.</span> <span id="s2557">I feel comfortable, I feel secure.</span> <span id="s2558">I feel part of the community, and it’s – and when I go to Vienna, I feel the opposite.</span> <span id="s2559">There is that vulnerability that they somehow were able to trans – trans – transfer to them s – to me, yeah.</span> <span id="s2560">I – I was – in one of my ski trips, I left my group, and – and I was going to go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s2561">And I went to Munich, and I never been in Dachau.</span> <span id="s2562">That’s where my father was incarcerated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: And as I was walking in – in one of the streets in Munich, and I was going to take this – there’s a suburban train that goes to Dachau from Munich.</span> <span id="s2565">I went, I bought a ticket in the – the automatic kiosk, and I couldn’t get on the train.</span> <span id="s2566">I just couldn’t make it, I just couldn’t get on.</span> <span id="s2567">And I went out to get lunch, and I saw these people with the tyr – Tyrolean, or alpine outfits, and laughing, and sitting by themselves.</span> <span id="s2568">I felt so terribly vulnerable and insecure and said, what in the world am I doing here.</span> <span id="s2569">And that’s the kind of feeling that I’ve never been able to lose when I – and I’ve been in Vienna, I don’t know, four, five, six times.</span> <span id="s2570">And I go there, it’s like some people go to – you know, they go to [indecipherable] they kind of have a holiday where they – they whip each other, they whip themselves.</span> <span id="s2571">And I go [indecipherable] get my whipping.</span> <span id="s2572">It’s – I have no any more, any traditional feelings about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: And why do you go back though?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s2575">I don’t have any desire to go back there now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: But for the four or five times that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: I – I got it out of – I got it out of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: You got it out of your system.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: I got it out of my system.</span> <span id="s2580">I belong to a hundred year old discussion club, and – and once every si – there’s – there are 47 – 42 members, and once a month somebody presents a paper.</span> <span id="s2581">And it can’t have anything to do with your profession, or the [indecipherable] gotta hide the content of the paper, because after discussion, you know, they don’t want to shoot you down.</span> <span id="s2582">And it’s – it’s a kind of a hard club to get into.</span> <span id="s2583">So, my paper last – my turn came up, and I decided to do a paper on – I have an 11th – this 11 minute film about Hitler coming to Vienna.</span> <span id="s2584">I got it from the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s2585">I think I’m their best customer for –</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: And we appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: Yeah, well, I don’t pay to see, they sent it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: And I’m – I go and advertise with it, you know.</span> <span id="s2590">And I speak – I made a lot of talks, I don’t have to – for example, this next Wednesday I’m speaking to a congregational youth group, at a – you know, I spoke last week to – to the histor – historical museum that I speak.</span> <span id="s2591">So I am on a kind of a speaking circuit, and – and I showed this film, 11 minutes.</span> <span id="s2592">You could see it, they – get it out of your library.</span> <span id="s2593">It’s Hitler’s coming into Vienna and one, two weeks after the – or three weeks after the takeover of Germany – of Austria.</span> <span id="s2594">And the town in this movie – it’s done, the movie is silent.</span> <span id="s2595">It was done by an American professor who were visiting there, who had a little Kodak camera.</span> <span id="s2596">And he was just – he had this unbelievable ability to be at the right time, to take pictures of Hitler coming to Vienna, and the – the beez – and the enthusiasm with which the Viennese greeted the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2597">And also there’s a little episodes in there about his wife trying to go into a Jewish shop, and the SA guy wouldn’t let her in, you know, because he said, this is a Jewish merchant, you shouldn’t buy here.</span> <span id="s2598">It’s an 11 minute film.</span> <span id="s2599">Let me tell you what – I have, someplace here in my office – I’ll – before I – we hang up, I’ll – I’ll give you – oh, here it is.</span> <span id="s2600">So you may want to take a look at it, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: It’s a – here what is, it’s Holocaust Museum, Baker family collection, USHMM, tape 2828.</span> <span id="s2603">Vienna, Austria, 1937 -1938, street scenes, anschluss, boycott of Jewish shops, Nazi propaganda.</span> <span id="s2604">And I – in my talks that I make, I show this film.</span> <span id="s2605">It knocks them out.</span> <span id="s2606">So, take a look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: I will.</span> <span id="s2608">It – you were saying at one point that you were translating while there were some interrogations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: Of prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: So – so, but you were working at the post office, so how – how did you come to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">A: I ran the the pri – yeah, I – I was insh – I had the post office, was one of my responsibility –</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: – APO.</span> <span id="s2616">So I – in other words, this, the – an APO, no matter where it was, was extremely important.</span> <span id="s2617">That was the only kind of communication the G.I.s had, of re – you know, sending home letters, of receiving letters, or sending home packages, or may – sending home money and money orders.</span> <span id="s2618">So, it was an army post office, which was very – part of the adjutant general’s thing.</span> <span id="s2619">So I got into that field, which – no experience, so anyways, I think of my honesty, integrity, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2620">Okay, so we’re close to occupation, I want to get out of here, I want to go home.</span> <span id="s2621">I want to go home so badly.</span> <span id="s2622">Finally my number came up, my points I had – you had to have so many points to get discharged.</span> <span id="s2623">I wrote to you – I did mention that I found my mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q: In Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: In Brussels.</span> <span id="s2626">We convinced her to sell the house and move to New York, which she did.</span> <span id="s2627">My cousin still, my cousin, I met her, she’s like four or five years younger than me, and never married, and she lives in Brussels, but I’m not very much in touch with her.</span> <span id="s2628">And most of my relatives who – we didn’t have that much of a big family – landed up in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2630">Did they – were there an – were they in Europe during the war, or had they gotten out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Couple of second cousins were in the war, like me.</span> <span id="s2632">And most of them, the – my two closest cousins were on a Kindertransport to Israel.</span> <span id="s2633">They were illegally –</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: Smuggled?</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: – sneaked into the British lines.</span> <span id="s2636">I mean, past the British.</span> <span id="s2637">Who – one was, I think 15 and one 16, they’re two brothers, and they were on the first – they were Hashomer or Hatzair, which is kind of a –</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2640">And they were the first – I think they left in 1938.</span> <span id="s2641">They both since have died.</span> <span id="s2642">I was close with them, I visit them.</span> <span id="s2643">They came here, they were our

professor at Technion, in basic chemistry.</span> <span id="s2646">And the other one, one of the children, their ch – their son is an entrepreneur, very successful, also in Israel.</span> <span id="s2647">So, I am in contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2649">But I – I still don’t recall how you got into the translating situation, being at the post office – was this before the post office?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: Yes, before.</span> <span id="s2651">I was called to – because they couldn’t – they had very few German speakers.</span></p>

id="s2660">A: And then again, coming home from when I left Vienna to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">Q: Now what kind of things were the Americans trying to find out from the first group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s2663">The – who were they, Nazis, weren’t they Nazis?</span> <span id="s2664">What information that they have, what was their background.</span> <span id="s2665">I just filled out certain questionnaires that the – the army prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Q: And what kind of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A: And most of them weren’t really Nazis –</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: – that they really did not come across like many people that were part of the SA or the SS.</span> <span id="s2670">The only ones that I really had, were really amer – were German soldiers.</span> <span id="s2671">Nobody – you know, they all were innocent, there never were any Nazis, they never knew war was going.</span> <span id="s2672">That’s what they claim.</span> <span id="s2673">And it was just – it was not very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: Well, wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: I felt very uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Did you feel like you could communicate with them at all, or that would have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: I could communicate with them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2679">Did – did you ever make them aware of the fact that this was a very –</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: I tried to – not to – yes, yes, a good point.</span> <span id="s2681">I never told them that I was from Austria, or Vienna.</span> <span id="s2682">I think I wanted to lord it over them as an American.</span> <span id="s2683">I wasn’t really fair to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: And you certainly were not communicating that you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: No.</span> <span id="s2686">I didn’t make a big deal out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: So – so basically, you were, during those months in Austria, you were uncomfortable for a variety of reasons, one was the – kind of the shadiness of – of being in the post office situation, where you were put in a situation that – that was not conform with your – with your –</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: No, it was fine.</span> <span id="s2689">I – you know, what – it was a very responsible job, and I felt okay about it, and I had some experience about it before, you know, clerical part.</span> <span id="s2690">So I didn’t feel bad about it, no.</span> <span id="s2691">I was really –</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">Q: But you did want to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">A: – it – it was a key – I want to go home.</span> <span id="s2694">I been there two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2696">Had you – aside from that first situation where you had gone back to the street where you had lived, did you ever run into other people that you had known before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: And then when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">A: They weren’t there, there wasn’t anybody left.</span> <span id="s2700">There were no Jews, I had been looking.</span> <span id="s2701">I was looking for Jewish people, couldn’t find any.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: And there’s no one moment that you can think of where – where the f –</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: There was one – there’s a synagogue that the Germans – that the Germans did not – that they left it, for historic reasons.</span> <span id="s2704">It’s called the Seitenstetten.</span> <span id="s2705">It’s in the first district and it’s in a building.</span> <span id="s2706">You can’t know it’s a synagogue unless – unless you’ve been there before.</span> <span id="s2707">You walk through a regular apartment building and inside is another – almost another building, and that’s a synagogue.</span> <span id="s2708">And that was a synagogue in the first district, and that’s the only one remained.</span> <span id="s2709">Every you – other synagogue in Vienna was burned down on November the 10th, 1938.</span> <span id="s2710">And there I found some Jewish people, and they were – but mostly they were DPs, displaced persons.</span> <span id="s2711">They were Russians from eastern Europe, or Poland, or someplace.</span> <span id="s2712">They weren’t Viennese.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: So, I don’t know if the Viennese had all been transported out.</span> <span id="s2715">I don’t know where – or they were in hiding.</span> <span id="s2716">So the people that now are Jewish in Germany, or in Austria, in my opinion, are primarily –</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: Immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: From – yes.</span> <span id="s2719">Displaced person from other places, and mostly from eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: And when – when do you get back – when

1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">Q: And why –</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">A: ’44 or ’45 – ’46 – ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">Q: ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">A: When was the war over?</span> <span id="s2728">I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q: The war was over in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">A: Okay, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: So you ba – you’re back in the States in December of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Q: And while you’re in Austria, are you corresponding with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: How are they reacting to the fact that you’re back in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: Never – that didn’t faze – were just startled that I was back there.</span> <span id="s2737">But there wasn’t any – I don’t remember, I just don’t remember that they mention it, or that they felt – I had no choice, and they knew that.</span> <span id="s2738">In other words, that’s what the army did, and you didn’t argue with the army, you just followed orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: Did they ask you to try to look anyone up in that first, immediate time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2741">I had a whole list of people.</span> <span id="s2742">I never found any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q: These were Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">A: All got killed.</span> <span id="s2745">Jewish people, yes.</span> <span id="s2746">I went looking for them in northern Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">Q: Did – did your experience going back to Europe at the end of the war, did that change you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">A: Did it change me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">A: I don’t know, but I think it probably did, yes.</span> <span id="s2751">It’s very mu-much – very part of me – very much part of me, and I think it had – it’s – i – it had to do a lot who I am, and what really my life is like.</span> <span id="s2752">It – absolutely yes.</span> <span id="s2753">Almost everything in my past, my first fi – 15 years, or 14 year – 15 years in Europe; in Austria; my becoming an immigrant into United States; my army experiences; landing up back in Austria and Europe.</span> <span id="s2754">All these ha-had tremendous impact upon who I am.</span> <span id="s2755">Moving to the strange city of Des Moines, Iowa, that maybe had what, 15 or 1200 Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: When – when did you move to Des Moines?</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: In 1950, of – December, 1949.</span> <span id="s2758">1950 really.</span> <span id="s2759">January ’50.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">Q: And you – you had said earlier during this conversation that in the – in the first years after the war you were – you were intent on making a life for yourself, starting a family, and – and being part of the – the American dream, and the American society.</span> <span id="s2761">So you weren’t – you weren’t really interacting with any of the refugees who were starting to come into the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: The – the Holocaust survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2766">Was – was there a moment before – before your interaction with the refugees in the early 70s where you would have been in that sort of situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: No, I don’t think that I was aware when I came back from the army, I was focused upon my education, I was focused on my relationships with my wife – well, that time my girlfriend, getting married, and having a family and having a career and all that.</span> <span id="s2768">And it just – it just – all this later – came much later when I was moderately successful and was able to assume responsibilities in my community.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">Q: And your – your wife was – is American born?</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2771">Oakland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Where did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: Where did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: Where did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: I met her when I was – just before shipping overseas.</span> <span id="s2778">I went to a Jewish USO and – in Manhattan, and somebody stopped me, I was leaving cause a fellow, a friend of mind that was going to meet me there, was the same outfit that I was, never showed up.</span> <span id="s2779">And they stopped me and introduced me to this girl, and she looked good, was very nice, and that’s – that was the end of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: And you were married in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: Married in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: ’47.</span> <span id="s2783">And then your children were born in ’49, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Well, I had four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: So, they were born ’47 – ’49, ’51 and on.</span> <span id="s2787">We lost one child who was – when he passed away he was 40 – yeah, I’m sorry, he was 38.</span> <span id="s2788">And he contracted a brain tumor when he had the measles when he was four years old.</span> <span id="s2789">And turned out to be we had him – it were – had a surgery, and he had radiation and turned out to be a wonderful young man, and – but it came back, because of excessive radiation in 1930 – in 19 – well, easier for me to say when he was 38 and married and lived in apple – and lived – lived in Appleton, Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s2790">So we lost one child.</span> <span id="s2791">I have one daughter that’s in medical field here in Des Moines.</span> <span id="s2792">I have another daughter that’s married to the – to an academic, and I have another s – son who is a lawyer in San Diego.</span> <span id="s2793">I have a grandson that’s a – also a journalist in New York City, covers city hall, who’s getting married next year, and also to someone who is with public television in New York, channel 13, and I have – so one son a lawyer, and I have a grandson – and I have a granddaughter that – two granddaughters: one is a senior at – at Colorado, and the other one is going – is about ready to go into graduate school.</span> <span id="s2794">She’s been a nanny in Boston for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: And when did you start talking about your background, and the fact that you were from Austria, and what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: Very late, probably in my 50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: Did you start talking to your family first?</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: Who did you talk to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: I think when I got active in the community in Des Moines, and also, you know, which kind of dragged me into other places, and I became president of the temple, and I became president of the federation, and I bet – and I chaired the fund drive, the All-In-One campaign.</span> <span id="s2801">Also received – there’s an outstanding citizen at Des Moines, that – non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s2802">It’s called the – what the hell is it called?</span> <span id="s2803">The office of Christians and Jews, once a year they would select a Catholic or a Protestant, a Jewish person, to give an award.</span> <span id="s2804">So it was at that time when I got busy into – and you know, sir – I got somewhat – moderately successful in my business – oh, and before that, I worked for another company, and I became president of it.</span> <span id="s2805">And then I left, and I bought interest in another business, and we had started another business.</span> <span id="s2806">So I got busy, and I was able to – able to get involved with the community, and mostly with the Jewish community, to begin with.</span> <span id="s2807">And then I really got involved also with the non-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2808">And I felt that was my res-responsibility, living in America, somewhat, to pay back.</span> <span id="s2809">I pay my taxes.</span> <span id="s2810">Pretty high.</span> <span id="s2811">And I do that, so I – I feel, you know, I – I’m paying – I think paying my – my – my – what – my fuf – to be able to have lived here, to be able to have been part of this American milieu.</span> <span id="s2812">I bi – feel myself very humbly [indecipherable] fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: Fred, thank you so much.</span> <span id="s2814">It’s been a very moving and – and – and wonderful discussion.</span> <span id="s2815">Is there something that you feel we haven’t discussed that you still would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: You have been wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: Oh, thank you Fred.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">A: Yes, I don’t know why, I – unbelievably, I think of all the people who’ve always questioned me, you’ve been the best interviewer –</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">Q: Oh –</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">A: – I ever had, no question about it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q: I am tickled pink.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: Because I really felt you understood me, and you were – you’re gentle and you were inquisitive, and you showed a great deal of – of compassion and – and humanity, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2823">Yeah, I felt very comfortable with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: Thank you Fred, I’m –</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: And it’s – yes, really, and I think you’ve done an outstanding job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">Q: Thank you, I’m really touched.</span> <span id="s2827">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">A: So, what happens to this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">Q: Well, I am – I’m just – End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
