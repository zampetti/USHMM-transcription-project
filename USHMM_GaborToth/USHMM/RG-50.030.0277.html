1993</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Would you be so kind to tell us your name?</span> <span id="s12">A: My name is Siegfried Warter.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Would you also tell us when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I was born in , Bucovina on the February 16th, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: If you could tell us in a few words something about background of your family, the profession of your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: The background of my family?</span> <span id="s17">My father was a cattle dealer.</span> <span id="s18">We were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s19">I had a sister, and we had a very nice life.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: If you could tell us in a few words something about your years in school and the atmosphere in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: When I started school, it was a public school.</span> <span id="s22">There was no discrimination.</span> <span id="s23">After a few years, discrimination started against the Jews with anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s24">Beginning when the Russians occupied the Bucovina.</span> <span id="s25">At that time, we were chased out of school.</span> <span id="s26">They formed -- there was one way that they took us together, and they asked the Jewish boys and girls to step -- they made a lineup, and they asked the Jewish boys and girls to step out of the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">And they told us that as of that time, we are not allowed to go anymore into the Romanian schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: This was during the Russian occupation or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: It was right after the Russians occupied the southern part -- yes, the southern part of Bucovina.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Would you tell us if during the Russian occupation you witnessed any scenes of deportation of Jews to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: During the Russian occupation, they did not take us out anyplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Would you elaborate on what happened to your family once the military operations -- to you, of course, once the military operations against Soviet Union started?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Once the war started against the Russians, they Jews in our place were considered like spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Now, we were not to -- we were not allowed to work.</span> <span id="s35">We were not allowed to travel too much from one locality to another, except with a permit from the gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s36">We also experienced a tremendous amount of anti-Semitism; it started.</span> <span id="s37">The Germans also went through with their army to the Bucovina to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s38">And right after the Germans attacked, there was an order that came down to us that we are going to be evacuated.</span> <span id="s39">We did not know where.</span> <span id="s40">It was on a Thursday morning that we knew that we are going to evacuated.</span> <span id="s41">The following day, Friday morning, the army came in with their machine guns.</span> <span id="s42">Surrounded us, and we were given the order to go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s43">There they had lined up already cattle cars, and as a family -- I think it was the middle of September that we were evacuated.</span> <span id="s44">With as much as you can carry, we didn't have too many things because they did not allow us to take a lot of things with us.</span> <span id="s45">So we were dumped then into a cattle car, about 60, 70 people with the little bit of belongings that you could take.</span> <span id="s46">And when we left on that Friday morning, we did not know where we were going, except in passing Czernowitz, that you recognized the station.</span> <span id="s47">And we went to Bessarabia, and we were asked to disembark in Hataki (ph) .</span> <span id="s48">That was the place next to the Dniester, to the River Dniester.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: That was the crossing point?</span> <span id="s50">A: It was the crossing point.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: When did you leave Hataki?</span> <span id="s52">What happened to you in Hataki?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: In Hataki, you could see from Hataki to Mogilev, the hill.</span> <span id="s54">And on that hill, you saw thousands and thousands of people going up that hill, like a continuous convoy going up that hill.</span> <span id="s55">In Hataki itself, it was raining.</span> <span id="s56">It was -- the mud was impossible to -- if you put a foot down, you couldn't drag it out from the mud.</span> <span id="s57">And you were standing there in the rain for about a day and a night, until they had only two of these pontoon bridges that could take about, let's say, maybe 100, 150 people across to Hataki.</span> <span id="s58">Because a lot of people were -- died.</span> <span id="s59">I myself bearing the , I don't know until today who he was.</span> <span id="s60">He grabbed me to dig the grave, and today, the person was dead.</span> <span id="s61">There was robberies going on because on the other side, when we came over to Mogilev, you had already Ukrainians there, which were very, very much anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s62">And there were robberies going on and killings and beatings and shootings, so we thought we cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s63">We would like to go further, and that's why when we came over, one of our family, one of my uncles, knew that -- he has a local permit, so he went to the Romanian Kommandanturen, and he was asking for a permit to leave.</span> <span id="s64">The day after he leave -- we didn't know.</span> <span id="s65">We had to be dependent on them to let us know where we are going.</span> <span id="s66">And so they gave us a permit to go to Moldova.</span> <span id="s67">So we were about 150 people that formed a convoy to go to Moldova, and we were escorted by two soldiers, two Romanian soldiers, which took us there.</span> <span id="s68">The trip lasted about two days and two nights.</span> <span id="s69">And when we came to Moldova, he says this is the locality.</span> <span id="s70">It was a small, small little village which was occupied by Ukrainian Jews and also Gentiles.</span> <span id="s71">But the inner of the village was like a ghetto, and that's where they chased the Jews and that's where they put us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Let me ask you something, please.</span> <span id="s73">The Jews, the local Jews, are these Ukrainian Jews from Morava or local Jews from Morava or Jews deported from other places of the Ukraine to Morava?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No, those were the Jews living in Morava.</span> <span id="s75">They all wore the yellow star.</span> <span id="s76">They put on yellow stars on them.</span> <span id="s77">And they were not allowed -- we were not allowed to walk out from that ghetto.</span> <span id="s78">They never gave you permits to walk away from the ghetto, and we settled in there with them.</span> <span id="s79">Life was really -- was peculiar.</span> <span id="s80">You didn't know the beginning that is going to happen.</span> <span id="s81">They wouldn't let you work.</span> <span id="s82">You had to eat, so you started to sell whatever you had from your possessions.</span> <span id="s83">You started to sell.</span> <span id="s84">I was -- there was no place where to work.</span> <span id="s85">The Jews, the local Jews, had some money.</span> <span id="s86">They had some money left over, their gold.</span> <span id="s87">We came with what we could grab in the last minute, so we did not have any rubles or any currency that was good.</span> <span id="s88">We only had Romanian drays and we had some gold, some -- we had a few diamonds.</span> <span id="s89">We had some watches, which slowly, slowly we started to sell and to be able to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Before I ask you finally to describe to us the day-to-day life in Morava, I would like you to go back for one second to the crossing of the Dniester.</span> <span id="s91">Because, if my understanding is correct, you witnessed also the Bessarabian Jews from Enest (ph) where . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s93">We witnessed -- we witnessed Bessarabian Jews and people in Mogilev.</span> <span id="s94">We were there and we were right next to the Dniester.</span> <span id="s95">And in one evening, they came in with their valiants, with horses.</span> <span id="s96">They chased them from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s97">Those Jews, it was a tragedy.</span> <span id="s98">We still had something to wear, but they did not.</span> <span id="s99">They were, I would say, three-quarters naked.</span> <span id="s100">Rags.</span> <span id="s101">And the soldiers were beating them, .</span> <span id="s102">The children were put out because they could not take the children, so they left them with us.</span> <span id="s103">I mean they left them with the people that were there.</span> <span id="s104">Said, "Please take care of my child."</span> <span id="s105">Three-year-old, four years, five- year-old children which couldn't go any further.</span> <span id="s106">It was a frightening situation.</span> <span id="s107">At that time we thought that in case we can get a permit, we'd be able to walk away and not being chased like they were chased .</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Let's return to Morava.</span> <span id="s109">And I am kindly asking you to describe for us what was the daily life in Morava?</span> <span id="s110">I mean what were your relations as deportees with the local authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Well, the local authorities were the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s112">Many of us were Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s113">We also had, on our part, we had a Jewish organization .</span> <span id="s114">So when they needed something, they asked the organization to provide it.</span> <span id="s115">Like, for instance, during the springtime, they were asking for people to go to work.</span> <span id="s116">And the Germans were providing a list that they needed 500 to 1,000, 1,500 people.</span> <span id="s117">So they came and they said that from Morava, they needed to send 500 young boys.</span> <span id="s118">As it were, we had to provide those 500 young boys.</span> <span id="s119">So it was a very hard thing for the Jewish community to go around and say, "Look, you have a boy.</span> <span id="s120">I want him to go to work."</span> <span id="s121">Which we did not know if they are going to come back.</span> <span id="s122">Because they took us all the way down to the roads.</span> <span id="s123">The was at that time in , and they're and .</span> <span id="s124">During the springtime, it was not so bad because it was not cold.</span> <span id="s125">But in the wintertime, when you have to be there, I mean three-quarters of the people died from hunger and from starvation and from cold.</span> <span id="s126">That was during the springtime.</span> <span id="s127">And at the end of the summer, they sent whoever remained, whoever was not sick, came back.</span> <span id="s128">During the wintertime, they took us out and cleaned the roads, so that the roads could be opened for the Germans to bring their supplies.</span> <span id="s129">At one time, we were taken out to , it was a little place where the railroad was passing.</span> <span id="s130">They had a lot of activities with there, so they had to cut the woods around the railroad, around the tracks.</span> <span id="s131">So they cut up the -- they cut the woods out for about 100 or 200 feet away from the tracks, so they should be able to see.</span> <span id="s132">This is the type of work that we had.</span> <span id="s133">And cleaning the roads, which I was there.</span> <span id="s134">I worked from early in the morning till late at night with one piece of bread.</span> <span id="s135">And I have seen with my own eyes like people were just standing there, and within a minute you saw them falling down and being stiff, because it was -- the temperature was 20, 25 below zero.</span> <span id="s136">So I was just lucky, I had some good clothing.</span> <span id="s137">And then I was young.</span> <span id="s138">Just young, that is good to do -- do whatever.</span> <span id="s139">When I came home, the depression had set in.</span> <span id="s140">I had seen so many people that did not come home, and they would always ask me, "Did you see this boy?</span> <span id="s141">Did you see that boy?"</span> <span id="s142">And I knew that he is dead, but how can you say that to somebody?</span> <span id="s143">That maybe they took him away and he's going to come home.</span> <span id="s144">But it was a frightening situation.</span> <span id="s145">The life in the ghetto proper was a -- you were living with hope.</span> <span id="s146">I personally am an optimist.</span> <span id="s147">With every day that passed, I said maybe God will help.</span> <span id="s148">Maybe something will come of it, and maybe somehow we will escape.</span> <span id="s149">But during the wintertime, we suffered tremendously because during the wintertime, you had the sickness.</span> <span id="s150">Typhoid fever with spots, that was tremendous.</span> <span id="s151">It took about two weeks if a person got sick with that sickness.</span> <span id="s152">Which I was sick with it, I was sick for two weeks with about 104 temperature, 105.</span> <span id="s153">And then there was like a crisis, and if you remained alive, a lot of people developed all kinds of sicknesses with their eyes.</span> <span id="s154">Even I have a complication of the inflammation of the veins on both legs.</span> <span id="s155">And I was sick for about six weeks during the wintertime after that.</span> <span id="s156">And thank God I escaped and I came through.</span> <span id="s157">Doctors didn't have any medications.</span> <span id="s158">"The only medication," he says, "I could give you is pray.</span> <span id="s159">Pray to God.</span> <span id="s160">I have nothing to give you.</span> <span id="s161">If you are strong, if you have a strong heart, you'll be able to live."</span> <span id="s162">And that advice, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s163">Thank God I came through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: How many people do you estimate were in Morava, local Jews and Romanian Jews?</span> <span id="s165">A: Local Jews and Romanian Jews together, we have about -- I would say about 2,500.</span> <span id="s166">Q: From which -- how many Romanian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: The Moravian Jews were about 1,500, and we were about 1,000, maybe more.</span> <span id="s168">We were mixed up, we were partly from our hometown, .</span> <span id="s169">We had quite a few people, we have some people from Sojava (ph) .</span> <span id="s170">We had some people from .</span> <span id="s171">And that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Can you think about any other dramatic or particular incidents that you witnessed in the ghetto of Morava?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: The particular incident that I witnessed in Morava, I mean that always comes to life in me was two incidents.</span> <span id="s174">One, that you were taken one time out to work on the tobacco fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">They had a lot of tobacco.</span> <span id="s176">And there they lined us up, and we were all young kids.</span> <span id="s177">There they lined us up after work, and they beat us.</span> <span id="s178">Gave us a tremendous beating.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Who beat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: The Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s181">We could not go to complain to the Romanians, because if we will complain, then the authorities, the Ukrainian authorities, which were very anti-Semitic, would kill us.</span> <span id="s182">So we didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s183">We took the beating, and that was it.</span> <span id="s184">And that went on for days.</span> <span id="s185">Every day, every day.</span> <span id="s186">Another bad incident that I came through was they asked us one day to bring our bulletins.</span> <span id="s187">You know, we had identification cards.</span> <span id="s188">To bring the bulletins into the police station.</span> <span id="s189">Anybody that is not bringing in, is not coming in with a bulletin to be signed by the authorities will be shot.</span> <span id="s190">So I said, "I have to go."</span> <span id="s191">My mother was crying.</span> <span id="s192">She said, "Don't go.</span> <span id="s193">Whatever will happen will happen."</span> <span id="s194">I said, "Look, I must go."</span> <span id="s195">So I went, that was late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s196">And as soon as they got them, about 500, 600 people they made a circle to their soldiers.</span> <span id="s197">That was the Romanians, and they beat them.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">They hit us with daggers.</span> <span id="s199">Then they sent us down to go to Mogilev.</span> <span id="s200">When we came there, there was about 2,500 people gathered together from our town, from Jelenia (ph) , from Shagala (ph), from whatever town, whatever they had there.</span> <span id="s201">And they were going to send us away to Gruenwald.</span> <span id="s202">Then from Gruenwald, to send us away to the Germans, specifically to Nikolayev to build a bridge.</span> <span id="s203">And we knew that any person that went there from before never came back.</span> <span id="s204">So what I did is plainly, we were all sitting in a yard surrounded by fences.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Somehow my luck was that I saw an opening in the fence, and I jumped out.</span> <span id="s206">And I went back to Mogilev, but they didn't know -- they didn't know.</span> <span id="s207">They did not have any notification that I left when I came.</span> <span id="s208">And that was the only thing that saved me.</span> <span id="s209">I had cousins, I had an uncle that went there, did not come back.</span> <span id="s210">They never came.</span> <span id="s211">Because you had to -- with the type of food that they gave you, you got sick.</span> <span id="s212">And after you got sick, the Germans shot you because they were very much afraid of having sick people, they feed their soldiers.</span> <span id="s213">And that was the end of that little incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: How long did you stay in Transnistria?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: In all we stayed from 1941 to 1944.</span> <span id="s216">In 1944 the Russians liberated us.</span> <span id="s217">They went through, there was about two days and a night, there was fights between the Russians and the Germans.</span> <span id="s218">And then you saw the Germans pulling back.</span> <span id="s219">I think we were lucky that the Germans pulled back, we could not -- they could not handle the SS.</span> <span id="s220">Because at the end of the German pullback, the SS always went and they always destroyed the towns.</span> <span id="s221">Somehow weird, it seems to me, that the Russians were too powerful and they chased them too fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">And they couldn't stop, and they didn't have any time to go around at that time.</span> <span id="s223">When I saw the first Russian in the village, I didn't recognize that it's a Russian.</span> <span id="s224">I just thought he was from the partisans that were fighting.</span> <span id="s225">They came in so fast, and there was machine gun fire that we sat all in the basements of the homes there.</span> <span id="s226">That we were just lucky that it just happened, and they liberated us.</span> <span id="s227">After the liberation, the Russians came down.</span> <span id="s228">They formed an army barracks, and said to us that we should come there to be examined.</span> <span id="s229">Because they wanted to take us and to sent us back to Russia to -- I would say an amount of military exercise.</span> <span id="s230">And they put us back in the front.</span> <span id="s231">So, but we formed right away detachments of boys and girls, and they left the localities, going towards Mogilev.</span> <span id="s232">And from there, we came to the cattle car train that was also the army train.</span> <span id="s233">Then we came back to .</span> <span id="s234">I came back, from I weighed, I lost maybe half the amount of weight.</span> <span id="s235">I came back I weighed maybe 70 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Then you stay in Czernowitz or did you go back to ?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: We stayed -- I stayed in Czernowitz about eight days, and I experienced in Czernowitz a gathering by the Russians, which they grabbed young kids.</span> <span id="s238">And they sent them away to the hinterland because they wanted to train us to be soldiers.</span> <span id="s239">They sent us to the Polish front.</span> <span id="s240">But I left Czernowitz, too.</span> <span id="s241">I was not that old, I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s242">We left Czernowitz, and we followed the front to Mehalin (ph).</span> <span id="s243">Mehalin is close to Sirets (ph).</span> <span id="s244">There's a Gibba (ph) Sirets, too.</span> <span id="s245">It's about 45 kilometers from Czernowitz, and there we went already over to the Romanian side, where the Romanian authorities were in charge.</span> <span id="s246">So there I was waiting for my parents to come, because they came about four or five weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Did already the Romanians switch sides at this moment or not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: The Romanians switched sides, yes.</span> <span id="s249">Yes.</span> <span id="s250">The Romanians formed a different government.</span> <span id="s251">They switched sides, and we could not go home because the front was in retreat.</span> <span id="s252">So as soon as we heard that a locality was liberated, we went a little bit closer.</span> <span id="s253">Until I came back to my hometown that was in 1944 on Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s254">There was nobody in town.</span> <span id="s255">It was a deserted town.</span> <span id="s256">There was a few people living with the rest of the people from over the mountains in that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Did you find your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No.</span> <span id="s259">Our house was burned down.</span> <span id="s260">The properties that we had was all burned down.</span> <span id="s261">It was in the center of town.</span> <span id="s262">It had burned down.</span> <span id="s263">But we moved then into a house that was -- that the people left.</span> <span id="s264">They left for Germany.</span> <span id="s265">Those were Germans, and we took the house over.</span> <span id="s266">And we lived in that house.</span> <span id="s267">My parents, myself, my sister, until 1945.</span> <span id="s268">Then in 1945, we -- in 1946.</span> <span id="s269">In 1946, we made applications to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Was it difficult to leave Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: It was -- no, it was not so difficult.</span> <span id="s272">But we were within the first to have applications and to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s273">And in 1946, we came here.</span> <span id="s274">That was in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Is there anything else concerning this period in between 1941 and 1944 that you remember and you would like to describe to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Well, the remembrance that I have with the most -- most peculiar remembrances that I have was the typhoid fever that hit us during the winter.</span> <span id="s277">The houses were marked with crosses, so that nobody should go in because it's very infectious.</span> <span id="s278">And at that time, I would say, 15 to 20 percent of population died.</span> <span id="s279">And you could not bury them because it was too cold, the ground was frozen.</span> <span id="s280">So what they did is they took up the people in the cemetery, and they dumped them on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s281">They left -- and the bodies remained there till the springtime.</span> <span id="s282">In the spring, they made graves for a hundred people or 200 people, when the government took over.</span> <span id="s283">The wagons that went around taking
