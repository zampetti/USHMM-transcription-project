They used to tell us to come on the market place.</span> <span id="s171">They took out x amount of Jews and they took them out of the city and they killed them.</span> <span id="s172">So, therefore people were afraid to do anything or say anything and this is how it went day by day.</span> <span id="s173">And then they started to ask all the Jews who's got copper, gold, silver, whatever they should bring it to them.</span> <span id="s174">If they knew that you have it and didn't bring it, they put you against the wall and shoot you.</span> <span id="s175">That's all there is to it.</span> <span id="s176">In front of everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">01:14:51</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s180">And then they, and of course they had -- when they came in was I think was in the fall, so they used to tell us, ask us, I mean tell us, better, to go and dig out the potatoes because it was already a fall and it was cold.</span> <span id="s181">The farmers couldn't take it out because the Germans wanted it.</span> <span id="s182">They needed potatoes.</span> <span id="s183">So, they used to come and whoever wanted to go went and of course I did, because I didn't want my mother to go.</span> <span id="s184">So, I went.</span> <span id="s185">That was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s186">Then when the winter came, they were taking people to clean the highways for them to go through so of course I went with my brothers.</span> <span id="s187">I didn't let mother or father go and we walked on the snow all night and when we finished we came home.</span> <span id="s188">I don't know how many months later, we had a ghetto.</span> <span id="s189">They made a ghetto, and certain streets were in the ghetto, some of them weren't in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s190">Like our house was not in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">01:16:20</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: I want to stop you before we get to the ghetto part.</span> <span id="s193">I'm trying to get another sense.</span> <span id="s194">When the Germans came in, they came in first, not SS?</span> <span id="s195">Just troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No, just troops, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: This was when, the beginning of September of '41?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: The 30th of June 1941 they came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: And then the SS came in a few weeks later?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: A few weeks or maybe a few months.</span> <span id="s201">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s202">It's so many years ago I can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: The first troops who came in, were they mean?</span> <span id="s204">Were you afraid of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No, no in the beginning before they did what they did we were not afraid of them because it was the regular army and they were not bad, as bad, but then came the rest of them and that's when it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And they were bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I couldn't walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s208">We had to wear the lattis(ph), you know, the yellow and you couldn't walk after 7 o'clock on the street unless you have a permit.</span> <span id="s209">Then it started.</span> <span id="s210">Every few months, they used to ask for something else.</span> <span id="s211">We also had a Judenrat, that means some of the Jews, they were the responsible people for all the Jews from the town, and whatever they asked the Judenrat came to the Jews and said, "Look, we have to do that or else."</span> <span id="s212">So that's what the Judenrat was for.</span> <span id="s213">But, was there maybe the ghetto and also you had to have a permit to go out.</span> <span id="s214">They send you to work, otherwise you couldn't get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">01:18:39 What else can I tell you.</span> <span id="s216">We didn't have it too good, believe me.</span> <span id="s217">One morning they told us to get out again, and the market place and they took out 120, 140 Jews and they killed them.</span> <span id="s218">Mostly was they were like teachers, nurses, more educated people.</span> <span id="s219">They had at least they know who to take out and that was the end of this.</span> <span id="s220">And also in '41, the end of '41 they made a shreta (ph), you know.</span> <span id="s221">They took everybody out of the houses and they are to go to the old cemetery.</span> <span id="s222">We had an old and a, a young one, or whatever.</span> <span id="s223">But the old cemetery.</span> <span id="s224">And they put us one by one and they took out the disabled, either kids or grownups.</span> <span id="s225">Some of them are half crazy or whatever it is and they just killed them, and then they brought in big trucks, army trucks and they took about a thousand of Jews.</span> <span id="s226">They dug a pit, a big one, and from one end of the pit to the other, a wooden board.</span> <span id="s227">A big one.</span> <span id="s228">They used to put you up there in the middle.</span> <span id="s229">Give you a shot and you fell in.</span> <span id="s230">Do you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s231">So, a thousand Jews they killed in that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">01:20:46</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Did you see this or people told you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: No,no, no.</span> <span id="s235">We know where they're at.</span> <span id="s236">My father was there and my mother and my two brothers.</span> <span id="s237">But I have an uncle that was making him for the Germans boots.</span> <span id="s238">All kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s239">He was the best and therefore he was with them just like this day.</span> <span id="s240">So, he was happy.</span> <span id="s241">So anyway, he came to where the graves were.</span> <span id="s242">He saw my father and mother and my two brothers so he told the zundenfuhrer (ph) he was the head of the city and told him he needs my father to make the uppers, you understand.</span> <span id="s243">So they let him out and they came home.</span> <span id="s244">That was still the ghetto.</span> <span id="s245">What can I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: I have a question for you.</span> <span id="s247">All of these Gentiles you were sort of friendly with before the war, what were they doing?</span> <span id="s248">What was their role?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s250">They didn't do nothing, they didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s251">It was a Jewish problem and this is what it was.</span> <span id="s252">They had nothing to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">01:22:08</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did you still talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well, to a neighbor yes.</span> <span id="s256">Ask me a question.</span> <span id="s257">I don't know what you want me to say, what you want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: So somehow you still maintained a relationship with your neighbors, a neighborly relation?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: A neighborly, yes, sure.</span> <span id="s260">You said hello and they said to us hello and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Now were you still in school at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: School?</span> <span id="s263">As soon as they came in there was no school for us.</span> <span id="s264">Jews could, will not go to school.</span> <span id="s265">They would not let them in.</span> <span id="s266">They closed up the schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: When did they decide you had to go to a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: 1942, the 22nd of February.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s270">Where did you go, where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Well, we lived with an uncle of ours, my father's brother.</span> <span id="s272">His home was in the ghetto, so we came down and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s273">In each room, and they had four rooms and there were four families, five families whatever it is.</span> <span id="s274">And we stayed there for the duration of the Ghetto or you may say for the duration of the Jews being in that little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">01:23:55</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Four families to a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s278">The more the better.</span> <span id="s279">Because they were only putting so many houses in the ghetto in other words, and the rest were empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: So your family was all together at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: At that point, yes, except for one of my brothers.</span> <span id="s282">He was sent to work and he was working somewhere in a little town so he wasn't with us.</span> <span id="s283">But I saw him later.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: What were the conditions like other than being crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Food, you need food and it was crowded and the fear itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: What were you afraid of?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Any day they can kill you.</span> <span id="s288">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Did you, when you were walking on the streets, did you see, were the Germans in the Ghetto itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No,no, they were outside the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">01:25:18</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Did you have your own police?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: We didn't have any police.</span> <span id="s294">They were staying outside the Ghetto where the gates were and if you're walking, you have a permit they let you out and then they brought you back in.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: So, there weren't a lot of beatings or anything like that in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: In the ghetto?</span> <span id="s297">Unless you did something wrong for the time being they don't have to beat you.</span> <span id="s298">They kill you right there and then.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: On the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: On the outside, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Was the Judenrat helpful?</span> <span id="s302">What did they do?</span> <span id="s303">What were their responsibilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Well, anything the Germans wanted they talked to the Judenrat and they tell them look we want so much of so much and we're going to get it.</span> <span id="s305">So, the Judenrat had to go to the Jews, to the rest of them.</span> <span id="s306">Even the Judenrat was also in the ghetto and they used to discuss what to do next, whatever they want.</span> <span id="s307">So, this is how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">01:26:33</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did you feel, do you remember if you felt that the Judenrat was trying to be helpful or whether they were bad guys or good guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: From what I know or remember they were good guys because it was a small little town and everybody knew everybody and everybody had brothers, sisters, uncles, you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s311">So it was different like in a big city.</span> <span id="s312">We knew each other by name, so I wouldn't say they were working for them, but there were certain things they had to supply to them or they're going to take out 20 Jews or 50 Jews and kill them if you don't get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Now when you described a few minutes ago some of your work assignments were those during the ghetto time or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: While you were in the ghetto did you have to work for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: So how did you spend your time every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: We stayed in the house, that's all.</span> <span id="s319">We couldn't go anyplace so we stayed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">01:27:50</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Were there any activities or any secret activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, before the ghetto specially the youth they were very organized.</span> <span id="s323">They used to get, they, to be like a Russian guy by the name of Vanka (ph).</span> <span id="s324">He used to come in between.</span> <span id="s325">He was a partisan and he used to come to our town by the ghetto and talk to some of the people, the young ones, not the old ones and tell them that there's going to be a killing and let them come.</span> <span id="s326">Most of the time everything was fine until the last time I remember he was like a double agent and he gave out some of the guys that were going to run away to the underground.</span> <span id="s327">One of them they caught and they killed him.</span> <span id="s328">But the youth were organized, not all of them, but alot of them, especially the boys, the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">01:29:10</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Did you or your brothers know about this or were you at all involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: My brothers were involved.</span> <span id="s332">I wasn't involved because girls were not involved but I used to take notes.</span> <span id="s333">Somebody send a little note, we used to, my brother used to give me something.</span> <span id="s334">I should take it over to somebody else and give it to them.</span> <span id="s335">So this is how they were organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: So, you served as kind of a messenger, a courier?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s338">We had, what's his name?</span> <span id="s339">He was a lawyer and he ran away from town the day before as soon as the ghetto started.</span> <span id="s340">They ran away about five guys or seven guys to the forest and they used to send the messenger or whatever it is, that we should come there, you know.</span> <span id="s341">Not me, but somebody else and they used to run away.</span> <span id="s342">See if you run away you were one person, two people, three people, they didn't notice it.</span> <span id="s343">So this is how some of them got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">01:30:31 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s346">02:01:02</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: So you were telling me there were small groups, some of them got away to the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yes, before the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: That's before?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Um-huh.</span> <span id="s351">And that was Boretsky (ph).</span> <span id="s352">He was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s353">In Poland they didn't get an education.</span> <span id="s354">He went to Italy, I believe, or Germany and he became a lawyer.</span> <span id="s355">He was one child.</span> <span id="s356">The parents had a store for leather.</span> <span id="s357">He and another few guys they were the organizers for the partisans.</span> <span id="s358">They left first and they kept on getting a few guys here and there and every time there was a shkita (ph), you know what it is?</span> <span id="s359">A killing, they knew.</span> <span id="s360">They used to send a duancar (ph) to tell us what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s361">So the second, the second killing was in 1942 on August 6, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">02:02:25</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: What happened is normally my mother used to give us packages, not with food, but she used to give us let's say a piece of material that you can make a dress or pair of pants whatever it is and a piece of leather which the farmers don't have it.</span> <span id="s365">Do you know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s366">Therefore, in case there's a shooting and we have to run or split, you know, at least for that they'll give you a piece of bread, some butter, or some milk.</span> <span id="s367">Something.</span> <span id="s368">You'll have something to eat.</span> <span id="s369">And everytime there was an the alarm, you used to take this little package and I started running and it was like a false alarm.</span> <span id="s370">You know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s371">The day that was really important because that was the day that no Jews allowed to be living in the town so they're going to make Judenrein.</span> <span id="s372">So how can you live there?</span> <span id="s373">You can't.</span> <span id="s374">So of course that morning I didn't take nothing.</span> <span id="s375">What I had on me, this is it.</span> <span id="s376">Everybody.</span> <span id="s377">So, my brother, he lives in Northbrook, in Illinois, he was with me.</span> <span id="s378">My mother, father and youngest brother were running one way.</span> <span id="s379">Me and this brother were running.</span> <span id="s380">I don't know where we were running but we were running and two houses from us was my uncle.</span> <span id="s381">That's my uncle that's the uncle that makes my shoes, you know.</span> <span id="s382">So, my mother went the other way and then she remember half way running to the hideout, she forgot, she better go back home and get a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s383">She just baked fresh bread in case you have to sit a day or two so you have something.</span> <span id="s384">By the time she got to the house she couldn't go back.</span> <span id="s385">So, my father and my little brother, the youngest one, they were hiding in an attic somewhere with another few couples and after two nights I think, they ran away to the forest because the town was a lot of forest.</span> <span id="s386">As soon as you walk out of the city there were forests.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">02:05:20</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: You were saying your brothers ran out, the city was surrounded by forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And a lot of people are from farmers, from the little towns, the little villages, you know, where they got married in our town to somebody or vice a versa.</span> <span id="s390">So in other words, they knew the vicinity very well.</span> <span id="s391">So, my father, my brother and this guy and a few more, they went to the forest.</span> <span id="s392">I was sitting with my brother knowing what my uncle did last time when they were killing us that he spared his wife and kids and everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s393">So I don't know, something told me I should go there.</span> <span id="s394">I went there with my brother and they also had a hideout, you know, down and we were hiding there.</span> <span id="s395">We were sitting.</span> <span id="s396">The first day was very quiet except they came in -- the Germans used to come in with a ball,a round ball, you understand, and we didn't have carpet so they used to take the ball and roll it over the floor.</span> <span id="s397">You see, if you dug something underneath it would settle, do you know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s398">So, the ball would have to stop.</span> <span id="s399">So it means that underneath there is somebody.</span> <span id="s400">You understand?</span> <span id="s401">Do you understand what I'm saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">02:07:38</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: On a straight floor when you throw a ball, okay, it runs until it stops by itself, you know.</span> <span id="s405">But here is not the case.</span> <span id="s406">You see if they dug underneath the dirt settled let the floor down.</span> <span id="s407">You know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s408">Okay.</span> <span id="s409">So, it makes just like a dent, it's lower, the floor.</span> <span id="s410">So they put the ball and it stops in the middle of somewhere they figure they better check, you know.</span> <span id="s411">Anyway, things got..., everything was fine.</span> <span id="s412">Then my aunt she was the aunt, my mother's sister, her kids, four of them.</span> <span id="s413">They had two boys and two girls.</span> <span id="s414">We were all sitting.</span> <span id="s415">My uncle's sister, with the children, maybe ten people, or whatever, and my uncle comes back because the zungenfuhrer (ph) asks him, "Where is your wife and kids?"</span> <span id="s416">He says, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s417">I better go looking."</span> <span id="s418">And he told them he's going to try to spare them too this time.</span> <span id="s419">So they told me, he come to us at night and took his wife out and the kids and he says that the zungenfuhrer (ph) said he's going to let you live and he told us there's going to be Judenrein, no Jews, you better go away from here.</span> <span id="s420">Go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s421">So anyway the following day we heard that my aunt and the kids got killed.</span> <span id="s422">They killed them right away.</span> <span id="s423">They only let live my uncle and the son.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">02:09:30</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: How did you hear these things.</span> <span id="s426">I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like.</span> <span id="s427">You said, "we heard this."</span> <span id="s428">You said the following day "we heard that my aunt was killed."</span> <span id="s429">How did you get this information?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: He came back.</span> <span id="s431">My uncle came back the following night and said they killed everybody except his son and he said we should better get out and that there was a little town that they had still our ghetto.</span> <span id="s432">So, this is what we did the night he came telling us.</span> <span id="s433">We ran away, I mean I ran away.</span> <span id="s434">We walked all night and during the day we went somewhere.</span> <span id="s435">I don't even know, on a farm, in an attic where they had the pigs and the cows whatever.</span> <span id="s436">We saw the Germans from far but you know your heart is in your mouth and you hope you survive.</span> <span id="s437">So, of course after the night, after the day got dark a little bit and we went walking to that little town with the ghetto.</span> <span id="s438">So, we came to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">02:10:46</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: What was the name of the town, Sonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Dworitz (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: One other question.</span> <span id="s443">When you left your ghetto, was it easy to get out that night?</span> <span id="s444">Were there guards or were you just able to walk out?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: You could walk out, yes, because between shooting and killing so many people there was no more ghetto.</span> <span id="s446">So, they used to put x amount of people, I don't know the amount, we had a movie house and they stuffed them into the movie house and from there they used to take them to the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: So, you got out, you slept in a barn or something that night and the next day you continued to the other town?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: The evening.</span> <span id="s449">You couldn't walk during the day.</span> <span id="s450">Let's say if it was in the summer time, which it was, or in the winter time when the days are longer or shorter so by evening most of us knew how to go to these small towns because they were not, maybe they were ten miles all together.</span> <span id="s451">You understand.</span> <span id="s452">So, leaving there was no problem to go into a little town and know how to get in there, you know.</span> <span id="s453">So, this is what we did.</span> <span id="s454">We came there in the morning and all the people.</span> <span id="s455">My brother was also the same place in the market place but he was also making shoes so they let him out.</span> <span id="s456">I mean not they let him out, they took all the people, all the workers, what they need, and they send them over to another working....</span> <span id="s457">It's like, a camp and the rest whoever did not make it they cut out with them.</span> <span id="s458">Some of them stayed in the hideout for four or five days because they had enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">02:13:18 And then the Germans sooner or later the Germans got them.</span> <span id="s460">So, the people that ran away to the forest which most of them are alive, and those that didn't, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s461">So, when I came to Dworitz (ph), I found my cousin there that he came also from another town.</span> <span id="s462">My brother was in that working camp about 30 kilometers.</span> <span id="s463">And my younger brother, he was there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: In the town or the working camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: In the working camp, not in town.</span> <span id="s466">So, I don't know how long it was, they went to the forest.</span> <span id="s467">I haven't seen him yet.</span> <span id="s468">I just had my younger brother with me.</span> <span id="s469">My father survived with the little brother and they came also in the forest.</span> <span id="s470">So, one of the guys heard that his sons are alive also in the same place where I was and he was also from a farm town so he knew exactly how to come.</span> <span id="s471">So, he came and took maybe ten of us, so he took me, and my brother, he took his kids.</span> <span id="s472">They were there too, in that Dworitz, that I'm calling that little town, and we went to the forest.</span> <span id="s473">Then I came to the forest I found my father, my three brothers and one I had with me, is four, you know, and what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s474">It was another time of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">02:15:14</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Let me just stop you.</span> <span id="s477">So, the forests were near by and this was early summer of '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: When you got to the forest, were there a lot of people, what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Well, it wasn't like a huge place you come in.</span> <span id="s481">No, forget it.</span> <span id="s482">He took us and he brought us where his wife and children are, okay, and he let us stay there.</span> <span id="s483">You stayed underneath the, the, the sky.</span> <span id="s484">I mean, what?</span> <span id="s485">You got a home there?</span> <span id="s486">So, anyway, we came with what we had.</span> <span id="s487">We used to make a fire at night to make something to eat because during the day we couldn't make it in case the smoke from the fire the Germans will catch on to, you know.</span> <span id="s488">So, actually the nights was ours.</span> <span id="s489">We were not afraid for the nights because the Germans didn't want to go in the woods in our territory because to them it's strange.</span> <span id="s490">You see?</span> <span id="s491">So, at night and of course the winter came, we used to make a fire.</span> <span id="s492">I slept in my coat and I woke up in the morning and they were burned out, you know.</span> <span id="s493">And what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s494">That's all we had.</span> <span id="s495">The following winter I think we made a tent, you know, like the army, I suppose, and that's what we slept.</span> <span id="s496">We didn't have anything, nothing.</span> <span id="s497">We became like this and that's it.</span> <span id="s498">So, the second year we were there and the Germans again started to kill us and made it again the same thing, a killing.</span> <span id="s499">They used to come and whoever they caught they caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">02:17:49</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: In the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: In the forest, that's right.</span> <span id="s503">So, they caught my youngest brother.</span> <span id="s504">He was eight years old.</span> <span id="s505">And what they didn't do to him.</span> <span id="s506">And then they killed him.</span> <span id="s507">You know, they cut you up and they mutilate you and then they kill you.</span> <span id="s508">So, we ran away, we ran away from that place to another place.</span> <span id="s509">In other words, we could move around in the forest but you still have to-- if there is a big highway, it's a no no because you don't know who's driving and who's going by, you know.</span> <span id="s510">So, we learned how to go this way or that way and we didn't have a compass or nothing.</span> <span id="s511">Compass.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: When they killed your brother, did they make you watch it or did you just hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: They took him away.</span> <span id="s514">Where are you going to go looking for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: You just learned later what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s517">The Gentiles were there.</span> <span id="s518">The people there they tell us what they did with him and that was it.</span> <span id="s519">So, he got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">02:19:11</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: How many, I'm just trying to get a sense of how many people were in your group at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: There was no such a thing as groups.</span> <span id="s523">The partisans they were organized just like my brothers.</span> <span id="s524">The younger one -- both of them did but the younger one did by himself, he went back to the walking log(?)</span> <span id="s525">, what's another name, and he and another boy they dug under the barbed wire and he already knew because he was there.</span> <span id="s526">He ran away from there and he dug it and he came in and he talked to an uncle of ours, they wanted winter boots.</span> <span id="s527">He was there with his son, you know, and he took up maybe 25 guys and he came back to the forest with them and went another time and took out my uncle, this one.</span> <span id="s528">The first time he took the son, and the second time he took the uncle and more people and they came to the forest.</span> <span id="s529">So, you see the people that were the partisans, they organized.</span> <span id="s530">We had nothing to do with them and they had nothing to do with us.</span> <span id="s531">So in other words if you take here families, ten families, one was living in this corner somewhere, the other one was living somewhere else.</span> <span id="s532">You didn't pay rent.</span> <span id="s533">You can move around.</span> <span id="s534">Nobody told you not to move around.</span> <span id="s535">You know, so we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: How many were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Well, in the beginning maybe three families, that's all.</span> <span id="s538">When I say families it could be two people out of the family, because the other ones they killed.</span> <span id="s539">You know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s540">It depends who survived.</span> <span id="s541">Sometimes let's say you hear about, oh your sister is..., somebody told me that your sister is in this and this place.</span> <span id="s542">You know.</span> <span id="s543">They would pick themselves up, they had nothing anyway, and they would go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">02:21:51</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So, from time to time maybe another family would join you or someone would leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes, that's right, but we had nothing to do with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Now, how did you get whatever you needed like food or supplies?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s549">We used to go at night to the farmers to beg.</span> <span id="s550">My brother went, I went all of us went wherever we wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s551">So, we used to go in different places and some of them used to give us something and this is how we survived.</span> <span id="s552">Of course in the forest we had cranberries, blueberries, boysenberries, you know that grows in forests, so we used to go--mushrooms--we used to go and pick them and we had something to eat.</span> <span id="s553">Bread we used to get sometimes from the farmers.</span> <span id="s554">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s555">We didn't have an oven, we didn't have nothing only the fire, you know, to make a fire that's all we had.</span> <span id="s556">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s557">Water, we used to dig a little hole and dig deep enough until the water comes up.</span> <span id="s558">When it came up we used to take it out and take a handkerchief and push it through, you know what I'm talking, the dirt because otherwise you're going to drink dirt.</span> <span id="s559">This is how we had water.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">02:23:42 We didn't starve to death.</span> <span id="s561">Nobody starved in the forest, but we didn't have enough to eat, but we survived.</span> <span id="s562">It was enough.</span> <span id="s563">We used to go to the forest there, the outside and see potatoes so we used to take them out from the ground.</span> <span id="s564">Sometimes we used to bake them by the fire.</span> <span id="s565">Sometimes we ate them raw, potatoes.</span> <span id="s566">We didn't have salt.</span> <span id="s567">So we didn't, okay.</span> <span id="s568">But we did survive, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: How did you know which farmers to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: We didn't.</span> <span id="s571">The only thing is if the farmers knew if they're going to give out a Jew to the Germans, especially on the forest, the next day the partisan will be there and going to put them, let them in the house, let them stay, take all the cattle and burn up the cows with them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: But you weren't working with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: The only -- my connection with the partisans is because my two brothers were fighting.</span> <span id="s574">My father had two brothers they were there fighting.</span> <span id="s575">My other uncle his son -- like I said it was a small little town so there was somebody that I went to school with, you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s576">So when I used to go sometimes if they stayed close to us sometimes, you know, but if it's far we didn't, we couldn't go, so they used to give us food.</span> <span id="s577">But the majority we had to go ourselves at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">02:25:41</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Were you ever, well, you found out sometimes where the people you knew in the partisans were sort of a word of mouth in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Sometimes we knew, not all the time and we wouldn't go risking our lives to go where they're at.</span> <span id="s581">Let's say if it's within a few miles we'll go to see them, but anything further or maybe I don't know we wouldn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: But you might come across other people who would say to you I ran into your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: How did you keep in touch at all?</span> <span id="s585">I mean how did you find each other occasionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Well, like I said it was a small town, whoever came settled down in here the other went somewhere else.</span> <span id="s587">So we used to go from one to the other place, depends.</span> <span id="s588">We didn't like to sit in the same place because in case somebody spot us, so we always kept on moving.</span> <span id="s589">But what I'm saying is not necessarily did we stay around the partisans.</span> <span id="s590">The partisans were different.</span> <span id="s591">So this is then in 1943, January or February my younger brother got killed.</span> <span id="s592">The white Pollocks killed him; him and another boy, and they brought the boxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">02:27:26 He was strictly with mines and railroading and mines, you know.</span> <span id="s594">He had 21, 21 times he mined railroads or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s595">And my other brother lived through the war, the oldest one, and when the Russians came in they took most of the boys.</span> <span id="s596">Some ran away, and some did not have to go because if the Russian what, major or whatever he was did not want to take the partisans because they were not fighters, you know what I'm talking, not army people.</span> <span id="s597">So, if he was different he said, "No, I won't let you go boys."</span> <span id="s598">The Russian army wants him but you're not trained for war.</span> <span id="s599">This is what happened.</span> <span id="s600">My brother went, stepped on a mine and he got killed.</span> <span id="s601">So I was left with one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">02:28:56 And what can I tell you.</span> <span id="s603">We did have a doctor there.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: In the forest, in your group, or just in a nearby group?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: No, no, he used to come from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s606">As a matter of fact the doctor lived through the war.</span> <span id="s607">He lived in Brighton Beach and all the people from my -- it's not only my town, there were people from other small towns, you know, they used to go to him as a doctor.</span> <span id="s608">He passed away.</span> <span id="s609">The partisans had a hospital, they had and it was camouflaged and the Germans never found the place, and he was the doctor.</span> <span id="s610">As a matter of fact, I had typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s611">Most of us had typhoid fever from all the lice.</span> <span id="s612">You didn't have anything to change off so you used to take the top shirt, whatever you were wearing, shake it over the fire.</span> <span id="s613">The lice should come out and get burned.</span> <span id="s614">You didn't have anything to wear.</span> <span id="s615">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">02:30:19 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s617">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s618">03:00:49</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: You were describing to me the fact that there was this doctor.</span> <span id="s620">What other, you had--</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: We had two doctors.</span> <span id="s622">One was an MD.</span> <span id="s623">As a matter of fact he pulled my teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: In the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: In the forest, a medical doctor, so what?</span> <span id="s626">Now, the other doctor that I'm telling you, he was exceptional good, and we were lucky that our place where we stayed next to us was a rich family.</span> <span id="s627">Some people had money.</span> <span id="s628">So, he used to come because they were sick too.</span> <span id="s629">We were all sick with typhoid fever so he used to come there, but when he was already there and we lived next door to them, he came.</span> <span id="s630">He gave me comfer (ph).</span> <span id="s631">You know what comfer (ph) is?</span> <span id="s632">Okay, so, he gave me that.</span> <span id="s633">A lot of them died, you couldn't take--and there was no medication, nothing.</span> <span id="s634">But he used to go if somebody was sick he used to help out.</span> <span id="s635">A very nice man, but he's not alive anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">03:01:59</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: What else did you have in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: For, In the beginning they had a bakery.</span> <span id="s639">I don't mean a bakery like you buy, you know.</span> <span id="s640">It's the oven.</span> <span id="s641">It was a big oven, a baker's oven and when the boys came there and there was nothing to eat or whatever so they went to the farmers and got flour and they took it to the bakery.</span> <span id="s642">We called it bakery but it was just an oven, a baker's oven.</span> <span id="s643">They used to bake bread for the partisans so if they lived close to me let's say, I would go over and they would give me, because we were all one family.</span> <span id="s644">You know what I'm trying to say?</span> <span id="s645">I wasn't afraid of anybody there and they were nice.</span> <span id="s646">We were all in trouble.</span> <span id="s647">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s648">But after that, the partisans used to go away farther, which way, either it was left or north or south.</span> <span id="s649">I wouldn't know, I'd never been there.</span> <span id="s650">But we survived, went at night and they gave us bread or flour or an egg or whatever it is, and we limited ourselves not to eat too much and what can I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">03:03:40</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: How did you spend the day time?</span> <span id="s653">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: If, when we were in the forest, where we were, in other words, as long you did not go out to the highway where somebody could spot you.</span> <span id="s655">We used to go for the mushrooms and the blueberries, you know.</span> <span id="s656">Now potatoes to go in the fields, we didn't go until it was half dark, that you could see where you're going because the Germans never came during the day, you understand.</span> <span id="s657">Toward the evening, rather.</span> <span id="s658">They used to start in the morning.</span> <span id="s659">So, this way we were not worried.</span> <span id="s660">And we managed.</span> <span id="s661">We were sitting one time, we're sitting when the--I better not say that.</span> <span id="s662">My husband said it.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: You just tell me your own story.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: The, the Ukraines when they came to the forest they're like the white Russians, you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s665">They're not afraid of anybody.</span> <span id="s666">So, the Germans got him and they used to go, the first one, to the small little passages in the forest.</span> <span id="s667">The Germans were afraid to go.</span> <span id="s668">They only went with the highways, the big ones.</span> <span id="s669">But this ones, we had the Bundlehofsitz (ph), for the, you know, my husband said to you.</span> <span id="s670">And we had the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s671">They were another one, bastards.</span> <span id="s672">They killed more people in the forest, yeah, because they knew and they were not afraid to go in the forest, inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">03:05:49 But at night it was much easier for us.</span> <span id="s674">Now, talking about the Russian partisans, you see, the head, eh I forgot how you say, groups, okay, of partisans.</span> <span id="s675">Maybe let's say 20 groups, 30 groups, I don't even know how many groups they were.</span> <span id="s676">Small ones, like, but they were groups that they didn't like the Jews.</span> <span id="s677">As a matter of fact, that lawyer that I told you, he was the first one, a teacher of ours and another, about five guys they went first.</span> <span id="s678">They didn't bother them because they spoke a good Polish and they did not tell them they were Jews, so they stayed before all of us came in, you understand.</span> <span id="s679">When we came and they find out the people, the Russian people, they killed them because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s680">That's why it's so--another one.</span> <span id="s681">For us, what you're talking family camp, I'm talking we didn't have any guns, we didn't shoot anybody.</span> <span id="s682">Some of the Russians, if Jewish boys, in other words....</span> <span id="s683">We used to have this companies, the partisans had companies.</span> <span id="s684">If they went with some Jewish boys and some Gentile boys we didn't have to worry for nothing.</span> <span id="s685">But if the Russian soldiers, Russian boys, eh, partisans figured they'll come here wherever it was and they knew there were girls so they figured they're going to rape them a few, you know.</span> <span id="s686">So, we had a place where we dug underneath like a dungeon, but what we did is we put walls on trees you know, and we made the walls and then we had the slippen (ph) also from trees, the smaller branches, the thinner one, and we put on the hay, you know what I'm talking, the slippen (ph).</span> <span id="s687">Well let me tell you, I had a, we had a place underneath the bed, what kind of bed, like the barracks like you see soldiers sleep in the barracks.</span> <span id="s688">And some of the pieces of wood would come out.</span> <span id="s689">When we knew that the Russians are here a few and no Jewish boys we used to run in, in there and hide, too.</span> <span id="s690">So, we had to, we as family like you, you're saying.</span> <span id="s691">We were afraid for the Russians by themselves.</span> <span id="s692">We were afraid for the people that lived around the forest.</span> <span id="s693">We were afraid for the Pollocks that call themselves Poland without Jews.</span> <span id="s694">They used to kill even the soldiers.</span> <span id="s695">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s696">So, we had to fight everybody and be afraid of.</span> <span id="s697">So I mean, it's a miracle.</span> <span id="s698">I'll tell you that we lived through.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">03:09:29</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: You had a lot of enemies?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Was there any organization to your group?</span> <span id="s703">Did somebody sort of establish the order and who did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, if you had a little tent you got the straw on the floor so you sleep on it and in front of that tent you make a little fire and if you have a pot, you put some flour in the pot with water with salt if you have it, and you have soup.</span> <span id="s705">So, there was no such a thing as anybody taking care of anybody.</span> <span id="s706">Everybody was for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Well, but within your family, did you have a certain job that you did every day or anything like that?</span> <span id="s708">Were you responsible for getting the berries?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: No, no, it's like, no.</span> <span id="s710">We were not responsible for anything.</span> <span id="s711">We couldn't be responsible for ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Now, if some other people came along and they wanted to join your group, was that okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s714">If you want to have a little tent there, it's empty, I don't care.</span> <span id="s715">Anybody can come.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">03:10:57</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So, did your group change as time went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Oh, we had a lot of them that some had a sister let's say five miles from there.</span> <span id="s719">There was also a few couples that picked themselves up.</span> <span id="s720">They had nothing to take care with them, no pillows, no covers, nothing.</span> <span id="s721">So, they went away.</span> <span id="s722">That's it.</span> <span id="s723">So I mean, my husband he used to come.</span> <span id="s724">We had one neighbor, I call him a neighbor, he had a tent too, and he knew all the little passages to get in and out to the forest from the forest into the villages.</span> <span id="s725">He's also from my town.</span> <span id="s726">So there used to be a lot of partisans coming to him that he should take them wherever they want to go.</span> <span id="s727">He knew where to go.</span> <span id="s728">This is how we used to see somebody.</span> <span id="s729">Otherwise, it's only what we are the three, four couples or whatever it is and that's it.</span> <span id="s730">We even had a baby born.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: In your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s733">A woman, look, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">03:12:18</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: How did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Well, that's how I met him.</span> <span id="s737">That man used to go with them for you know they go to get some food too.</span> <span id="s738">They still go and get food, cattle.</span> <span id="s739">But with them it was different.</span> <span id="s740">They were men with rifles or automatics.</span> <span id="s741">My brother was wearing a, used to have an automatic and so for them it was different than for us.</span> <span id="s742">We were isolated from everybody.</span> <span id="s743">The only thing is, um, I, because I would, I had my uncles, my cousins there, so sometimes my brothers when they were going from one place to the other if they're passing by they would come and bring us some bread or some whatever it is.</span> <span id="s744">So, we used to see them.</span> <span id="s745">But others and that, they were on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Tell me a little bit more about how you met your husband, how that came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Oh, my husband?</span> <span id="s748">So he, one evening I was there in that, by the neighbors, or in the little tent, dungeon you want to call it.</span> <span id="s749">It was a dungeon, you know, and they came to pick up that guy.</span> <span id="s750">They should take him where they want to go.</span> <span id="s751">This is where I met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">03:13:54</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: What happened.</span> <span id="s754">Tell me the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: What happened?</span> <span id="s756">Like young kids, girls, boys, you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s757">He used to come there often enough until we got acquainted and of course he was on one side of the wall and I was on the other side of the wall.</span> <span id="s758">I mean, he didn't come to see me.</span> <span id="s759">You know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s760">He came because they needed somebody should take him.</span> <span id="s761">Him and some old guys, and this is what had happened.</span> <span id="s762">Then liberation came.</span> <span id="s763">I don't know where he was.</span> <span id="s764">But then somebody told me where he is and we got acquainted again and we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: But in the forest you kind of developed a special friendship, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: He used to come to take that guy should take him wherever they want to go.</span> <span id="s767">And what, they couldn't do things because it, they have so much time in the night to take care of their business.</span> <span id="s768">So I mean no no, no.</span> <span id="s769">Not my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: In the forest, did people start having romances or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s772">That they had.</span> <span id="s773">Some, most of them had.</span> <span id="s774">One of my girlfriends as a matter of fact she lives not far from my town, Slonyim (ph).</span> <span id="s775">She lived in my town after the war, but she moved away to Slonyim (ph), it's a bigger city I suppose.</span> <span id="s776">He was the mayor of the city and he's a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s777">My husband mentioned his name, Sergaibiele (ph).</span> <span id="s778">Dubakov (ph), sorry, Dubakov (ph).</span> <span id="s779">Was a very nice guy and she married him.</span> <span id="s780">And she stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">03:15:55</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: What about religion in the forest?</span> <span id="s783">Did you pray, did you in any way observe special days?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s785">What are you going to pray?</span> <span id="s786">They killed everybody already and you don't know if even in ten minutes you're going to be dead so what are you going to pray, for what.</span> <span id="s787">No, we didn't pray, we didn't go anyplace.</span> <span id="s788">There was no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: What was, did you have any kind of plan or goal or anything while you were there or were you just there?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: We were like dummies.</span> <span id="s791">We just lived by the day and see that we have enough, something to eat and survive that's all.</span> <span id="s792">Other than that nothing.</span> <span id="s793">First of all when we go in the forest he told us no Jews in Poland all together.</span> <span id="s794">We thought, "We are the only one survivors."</span> <span id="s795">We didn't realize that there are, were people surviving like concentration camps, you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s796">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s797">We thought we were the only one who's surviving.</span> <span id="s798">So when the Russian soldiers, when, I mean, the Russians came, liberated us, our part, you know because I walked with them just like you see the soldiers walking on the highway on both sides, you know, the tank or the pen, pensard (ph) truck, whatever it is, and they were walking and I was walking because they were going to my town.</span> <span id="s799">We came home and this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">03:18:06</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Okay, I want to stay in the forest a little bit longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: I'm glad you like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Did you feel there was any difference between being a girl in the forest and a boy or a man.</span> <span id="s804">Did you feel more vulnerable?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Not especially no.</span> <span id="s806">You see, most of the girls were looking for boyfriends or the boyfriends looking for girls.</span> <span id="s807">I didn't have to look because I had my father and my brother with me.</span> <span id="s808">So, the three of us and we had another family, I wasn't looking for that.</span> <span id="s809">But some, yes, it's like Harold said.</span> <span id="s810">You can make a novel out of what went on in the forest.</span> <span id="s811">There's no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: I'm just trying to get a sense because we really don't hear much about the differences between men and women but I suspect that there were, that women might have had a different experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: There were girls that were fighting just like the men.</span> <span id="s814">And there were girls that stayed; they had parents, like I had a father.</span> <span id="s815">They stayed with them.</span> <span id="s816">But some of them had boyfriends.</span> <span id="s817">My husband is alive because he didn't accept an offer from another girl.</span> <span id="s818">I betcha he can hear.</span> <span id="s819">She hid, she--every boy she hid got killed or died, whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s820">See, she wanted him to get married there and stay married and he said nothing doing.</span> <span id="s821">First I have to live through the war and then we'll see.</span> <span id="s822">She didn't want it so she picked up another few boyfriends, you know, and they all got killed.</span> <span id="s823">I said to Harold it's a good thing you ran away from her.</span> <span id="s824">No joke.</span> <span id="s825">I feel that way.</span> <span id="s826">Somebody is unlucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">03:20:22</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: So what you're saying is that the girls in the forest wanted some sort of protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: And they mostly went to the Gentile soldiers, or partisans, they were more safer with them.</span> <span id="s830">Because let's say if you are a pretty girl and you have a Jewish boyfriend, right, and there comes a, we used to call them Bostochnik (ph).</span> <span id="s831">That's the Russian, from west, you know, all the way from the eastern part.</span> <span id="s832">So, if they had their eyes on somebody let's say it wouldn't do anybody any good, any Jewish boy to go with that girl because he's going to be there.</span> <span id="s833">He can take a boy and kill him for that too, just to be able to go with that girl.</span> <span id="s834">So, there was, yes, yes, a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: What about when we talk about the partisans you made the point that you were really very separate but you'd run into them from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: You also said that sometimes you might make bread for them or they might bring you things.</span> <span id="s838">Was there any--</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: I didn't make bread for them.</span> <span id="s840">I told you about a bakery.</span> <span id="s841">When we came in they had a bakery, a baker's oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Oh, it was a partisan bakery?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s844">So and we, the first year we were close, too, so I used to come like I said.</span> <span id="s845">I used to go into the kitchen and there were the girls with this one I went to the school and with this one was a neighbor of mine, whatever it is, you know, and they would give me food.</span> <span id="s846">This is what I was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">03:22:12</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: So there was really no mutual help between your family and partisan groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: No, they were entirely separate from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Were you ever in a situation where somebody whether it was the local people or partisans or Soviet partisans who came and took the few things you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: The only thing I remember is one of the Russian guys was chasing my brother because he had boots on and he wanted the boots.</span> <span id="s852">Yes, they would do things like that.</span> <span id="s853">That's why I said we had to hide from everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: You never were really safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Did you have many close calls?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes, one time they were chasing me and the bullet went into the tree instead of me.</span> <span id="s858">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Who is "they?"</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Meaning Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: They were nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Oh, they came, they came to see us yes, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s863">See, we were inexperienced how to live there and what to do there, you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s864">To us, it was new.</span> <span id="s865">Well, how do you know how to, what to do and when to do.</span> <span id="s866">So in the beginning, yes they would.</span> <span id="s867">But later on they didn't.</span> <span id="s868">They send those other ones, the Ukraines and the Lithuanians to do the dirty work.</span> <span id="s869">Oh, yes, we had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: So as time went on this got easier or you learned how to live there better?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No, the same thing, the same thing.</span> <span id="s872">Like I said we didn't think there was any Jews outside of the forest because they made every city Judenrein, no Jews, so where are they?</span> <span id="s873">We didn't know the concentration camps that they are alive or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s874">Sometimes the farmers used to come from the city and tell something, the partisans or whoever it is, you know, what's going on but other than that they didn't have radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">03:24:40</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: When you talk about, I think that's really interesting that you say you thought you were the only Jews alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: How did that make you feel or what did you think was going to happen in the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s880">When we saw the Red Army, this was it.</span> <span id="s881">Now we are alive, you understand.</span> <span id="s882">So it means the Germans are not here because the Russians are here so of course this gave us a big boost.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: But before that, when you thought we're the last Jews in Europe or in Poland--</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yeah, Poland, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Did that make you feel -- give you more strength that you had to stay alive or make you depressed?</span> <span id="s886">It's a strange feeling isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s888">You know why?</span> <span id="s889">Because we took it each day as it comes.</span> <span id="s890">We did not know what tomorrow's going to be and we knew that the Germans are here and how long it's going to take for them to kill us all.</span> <span id="s891">So therefore we didn't have any hopes, anything.</span> <span id="s892">No hopes.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">03:26:12</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: When, I guess in 1943 the Soviet army really took charge of the partisans did that make any difference to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Well, to me, no.</span> <span id="s896">But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come with airplanes for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it was different.</span> <span id="s897">Sure, you felt a little bit like somebody's here to help.</span> <span id="s898">You know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s899">They didn't.</span> <span id="s900">They didn't come to the bottom of the, you know.</span> <span id="s901">They used to turn down from the sky sort of, you know, and fly away.</span> <span id="s902">They never came to land.</span> <span id="s903">They did not land.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: But you would find out about this through the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Nope.</span> <span id="s906">You see they, I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s907">Because they had a certain place where there's no trees.</span> <span id="s908">It has to be a big place, okay, so they already knew where to come and the partisans knew where to wait for them so they used to drop whatever it is, ammunition, medication, whatever it is and they went back up.</span> <span id="s909">But at least we knew that Russia knows that we're here.</span> <span id="s910">You understand?</span> <span id="s911">SO, it gave us a different feeling.</span> <span id="s912">But eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: I know, but how did you know that if you didn't have contact with the partisans?</span> <span id="s914">How did you know this was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Because it happened in this part of Vivorg (ph) exactly then, you know, and what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s916">They had to have a field where to drop it.</span> <span id="s917">You should see how the sky was lighting up.</span> <span id="s918">You can, you wanted to dance and sing, but you couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s919">But this, this is all.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: So you saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Oh, yes with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s922">Yup, that I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">03:28:32</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Okay, that's what I was trying to understand.</span> <span id="s925">What do you think was the hardest thing about living in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: The hardest thing is survival.</span> <span id="s927">This is an answer, I don't know.</span> <span id="s928">Survival was the hardest thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: What was the most difficult thing to do in order to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: God should be with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s933">04:00:52</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: How long were you in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: About two and a half, three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: That's a long time.</span> <span id="s937">This is the Lipitrani (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yeah, Lipijanskipusch (ph).</span> <span id="s939">We didn't have toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s940">We didn't have soap.</span> <span id="s941">We had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Anything else you can tell me about the life in the forest or being on the run.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Well, most of the time we did.</span> <span id="s944">We stayed in one place and then we run away to another place and then we came somewhere else and then we come back here because my father didn't like to stay either in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Do you remember being nervous or ever having a nice day or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I didn't think of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: So, did you have a sense when you thought maybe liberation was possible; it was going to be soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: All we knew is that they caught a partisan and they hung him.</span> <span id="s949">You know what I'm talking?</span> <span id="s950">They found somebody, they hung them.</span> <span id="s951">That's all we remember.</span> <span id="s952">That's all we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">04:02:19</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: You were very aware that there were Germans around.</span> <span id="s955">Were there bombings or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: No.</span> <span id="s957">I was saying to my husband.</span> <span id="s958">I don't know, they had the airplanes, the Germans, why didn't they bomb us.</span> <span id="s959">He has no answer, I have no answer.</span> <span id="s960">Do you have an answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Tell me about your liberation, what happened?</span> <span id="s962">When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: In 1944.</span> <span id="s964">Uh-huh, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: The summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s968">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Oh, I walked with the soldiers until we got to my town.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Wait a minute, you didn't walk with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s971">They had to find you somewhere.</span> <span id="s972">How did you know you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Well, we saw them.</span> <span id="s974">That we did.</span> <span id="s975">From where we were, we saw the highway and we saw the Russians and the Russians had, the infantry used to come to the bushes also and a lot of times you know a lot of people got killed from the Germans because the Germans they took over their uniforms and they walked through the same forest that we were.</span> <span id="s976">So, you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s977">The first thing we saw, the, the Russians.</span> <span id="s978">First of all, we spoke Russian, so that was no problem as far as the language.</span> <span id="s979">When we tell them from where we are they saw us, you know.</span> <span id="s980">So I have no problem.</span> <span id="s981">We walked together all the way until we got into my town.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">04:04:10</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Was this pretty exciting?</span> <span id="s984">I mean did you believe this?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: How could it be exciting?</span> <span id="s986">You are pleased that you are alive and came back to town, but we had on both sides of the city two big graves that they made in the first time when the killing was and the last time, so how can you be so happy.</span> <span id="s987">You were pleased for the time being.</span> <span id="s988">I didn't know what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: What, do you remember what you did first now that you were free and you were back in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: What I did?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s993">We saw each other, all my friends and everybody who ever had a house or the parents had a house, they moved into the house.</span> <span id="s994">The Gentiles did not have our houses yet.</span> <span id="s995">That's another story.</span> <span id="s996">So, we came there.</span> <span id="s997">Some of them were happy to see us and some of them were not happy to see us.</span> <span id="s998">But I, me personally, my father since he was making the uppers for the shoes he gave his sewing machine, he bought a sewing machine afterwards and he gave it to a Gentile who used to be a customer of his.</span> <span id="s999">And he came and got back the sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1000">So, he started right away to work.</span> <span id="s1001">So, they found us.</span> <span id="s1002">He was the only one left, alive.</span> <span id="s1003">There was no other ones so they used to come and ask him to make them something.</span> <span id="s1004">After all, they didn't have the leather because where are they going to get?</span> <span id="s1005">So, if the guy is from the farms used to have the leather or whatever they had.</span> <span id="s1006">They used to come.</span> <span id="s1007">My father used to make him the shoes and they used to bring us butter and milk and flour and oil.</span> <span id="s1008">You name it, and fish, everything.</span> <span id="s1009">We had food up to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">04:06:27 I had a baker's oven.</span> <span id="s1011">Of course I was already 17 years old.</span> <span id="s1012">I wasn't a baby, you know, but I used to make pancakes and I used to make things and I used to bake and if the Russian soldier were coming, you know, from one side and to the other side, I don't recall from where they came, I always had food to give.</span> <span id="s1013">Even when my husband told you about the girls that he was running around, you know, the three or four girls, they were not in their town because they had nothing there.</span> <span id="s1014">When they came to ours, our house was open.</span> <span id="s1015">Each one got to eat.</span> <span id="s1016">They can eat whatever they want.</span> <span id="s1017">We had enough of everything.</span> <span id="s1018">That I did.</span> <span id="s1019">I have a girlfriend in Texas, Houston, Texas.</span> <span id="s1020">We were together in the same hideout in the forest.</span> <span id="s1021">She and her brother used to come -- her brother went to school with my brother and I went to school with her and I used to make two, three meals a day and they came.</span> <span id="s1022">They had no mother, no father.</span> <span id="s1023">They had a house but that's about all, but they had no access to anything and they had no money.</span> <span id="s1024">You need, I don't think if you can get something with money.</span> <span id="s1025">But, so, as far as that food, economical I had no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: What was left of, was the town in pretty good shape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes, the town was almost the same as we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Did you start going to the synagogue again after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: You can go, you know, what the Russians did with the synagogue?</span> <span id="s1030">They made it into warehouses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">04:08:47</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: This was before the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: They made it before and when they came after the Germans it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1034">Warehouses, not Temples.</span> <span id="s1035">We couldn't go any place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Did you find an alternative way to practice your religion after the war or was that not important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: The Russians wouldn't let you.</span> <span id="s1038">They'll arrest you, you're not supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So not even secretly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: No.</span> <span id="s1041">If you want in your own house if you want to say a prayer I suppose nobody can tell you not to, but outside forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So how long did you stay in your town after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: In my town I stayed... We came, what?</span> <span id="s1044">'44 in June, July, somewhere, in '44 until May the 27th or 25th of 1945.</span> <span id="s1045">We got married in '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">04:09:59</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: How did you find each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Well, I had a girlfriend in a city, Baronovitch (ph), from my town, but her mother married into somebody from the other town so they lived there.</span> <span id="s1049">She was with me in the forest too but she was in a different little forest or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1050">So, she was telling me, that Harold, my husband, is here in town, you know.</span> <span id="s1051">So one time she caught him, she saw him, she talked to him and I came out.</span> <span id="s1052">I stayed with her and we went to see him and he said hello and this and that and that's when it started.</span> <span id="s1053">I used to and then in '45, yeah '45, we got married.</span> <span id="s1054">I used to, I worked for a newspaper.</span> <span id="s1055">I was a setter on the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1056">A little paper from our town.</span> <span id="s1057">He worked for the KGB.</span> <span id="s1058">So they didn't let him move into my town and they didn't let me out to go to his town.</span> <span id="s1059">So then they had the Russians said any Polish citizen that wants to go home can go, except my husband.</span> <span id="s1060">So, my father went and registered him in my town.</span> <span id="s1061">But they found that out.</span> <span id="s1062">And they called him in and said, "Hey, what is this?</span> <span id="s1063">," you know, and I couldn't go there.</span> <span id="s1064">Well, anyway we ran away from there.</span> <span id="s1065">We left my father and my brother there.</span> <span id="s1066">My father was waiting for his brother that's coming from the front lines because he was being taken in the army.</span> <span id="s1067">So, Harold wanted to leave so the second time around, he registered in a different way and we got out.</span> <span id="s1068">They were chasing us, but we got out.</span> <span id="s1069">Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">04:12:31</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: We went to Bialystok and then we went to Lodz.</span> <span id="s1073">From Lodz we went to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: What was the plan here?</span> <span id="s1075">You kept going to these different cities.</span> <span id="s1076">Did you have a plan or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: No, you go.</span> <span id="s1078">However you want to go you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: One day you said I think we'll go to Lodz today, no idea why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: No, there was organizations, you know, and they have stops here and there whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1081">In the beginning when we came to, from Lodz, yeah, from Lodz, we went to what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1082">Hungary.</span> <span id="s1083">See we were supposed to travel as Greek Jews because as Polish Jews where are you going?</span> <span id="s1084">You understand?</span> <span id="s1085">We already passed up Poland so you cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1086">Now what are you going to speak?</span> <span id="s1087">There is Russians a lot and if you speak Russian they'll find out that you should be going back, you know.</span> <span id="s1088">So anyway we were going as Greeks.</span> <span id="s1089">You see, so, we came to Hungary and the Jewish community there, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s1090">They put us up where to sleep.</span> <span id="s1091">They gave us food and we were supposed to go to Romania but the illegal, eh, the illegal, route to go to, eh, Romania, to go to Israel was closed.</span> <span id="s1092">They couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1093">So, we went from Hungary, we went to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">04:14:35</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Now, were you planning on going to Israel?</span> <span id="s1096">Was that your goal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Yes, we were going to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1098">And from Austria we walked to the Alps, yeah, yeah, yeah, with the packages, whatever we had left and we came into the English side and they put up us to sleep and then came the Israeli, it was the English Fifth Army, but they were made up of Israeli Jews.</span> <span id="s1099">You understand?</span> <span id="s1100">Okay.</span> <span id="s1101">So, they were waiting for us by the border of Italy and they took us out from that little camp where we were and in closed trucks, you know, army trucks and they took us to Treviso.</span> <span id="s1102">That's the first place we were in Italy.</span> <span id="s1103">And when we came there let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1104">That was a sight.</span> <span id="s1105">They set up long tables, long, long tables with all kinds of gems and scrambled eggs and butter.</span> <span id="s1106">We ate like pigs.</span> <span id="s1107">We were hungry, you know what I mean for the people that came in Israel, eh, in Italy.</span> <span id="s1108">And after that, they started to assort us where somebody wants to go or doesn't want to go, where they want to stay, you know what I'm talking.</span> <span id="s1109">They had places where we could go, stay, you know.</span> <span id="s1110">So, we chose to go in one place and this is how we came to Italy.</span> <span id="s1111">We liked it there.</span> <span id="s1112">It's very nice country, beautiful people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Were you traveling with other people or just you and Harold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: No, a whole group.</span> <span id="s1115">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">04:16:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: So, how long were you in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Oh, we came in in May, the 27th of May 1945 till 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Where were you living in Italy then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Well, we were first if I tell you in a little place, Nonantolla (ph), Bologna, Modena.</span> <span id="s1121">We were in Venice.</span> <span id="s1122">We were in Milan, and my husband was a madrich.</span> <span id="s1123">You know what a madrich?</span> <span id="s1124">A head of a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1125">Then of course I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s1126">They had a place in Florence that was like a little clinic.</span> <span id="s1127">So, downstairs was the clinic and the upstairs had let's say, five rooms, ten rooms.</span> <span id="s1128">I don't even remember.</span> <span id="s1129">We had a nurse, Theresa.</span> <span id="s1130">She used to take care of us.</span> <span id="s1131">The doctor used to come once a week I think and see the women, pregnant women.</span> <span id="s1132">No other women, but only pregnant women.</span> <span id="s1133">And we stayed in Florence until we got a visa and we came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: When you were living in Italy in these different cities, were you living in an apartment?</span> <span id="s1135">Were you living in a community, a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Villas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Did you meet up with other refugees, people who had come from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh sure, sure, there were a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Was this a surprise to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Well, I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1141">We came in in '45 they just let out the concentration camps, so we knew that they are liberated, were liberated just now and we were liberated more than a year before.</span> <span id="s1142">So it wasn't a-- I was surprised at that late, you know.</span> <span id="s1143">Of course if the Russians wouldn't come to us, we would have to wait for the Americans.</span> <span id="s1144">Who knows if we would be alive all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">04:19:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So you met some of these people that came straight out of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1148">And you had tables with people sitting at tables taking your name, who you are, where you are, where you're going, when you're coming, you know.</span> <span id="s1149">So, and this is the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Did you befriend any of these camp survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: No, because we were going from one place to the other until we didn't come to Italy.</span> <span id="s1152">We didn't have any friends.</span> <span id="s1153">Of course in Lodz, yes we had my cousin.</span> <span id="s1154">He came there, another one came.</span> <span id="s1155">I see, yes, I did see a few but not too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: But in Italy you saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Were they in pretty bad shape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: No, they were not.</span> <span id="s1160">The only one that was in bad shape was my uncle's brother that I recognized; I don't know how I did it.</span> <span id="s1161">He came from Mauthausen and I told Harold, "There is my uncle's brother."</span> <span id="s1162">He said, "You must be crazy."</span> <span id="s1163">I said, "No Harold."</span> <span id="s1164">He lived in, he got married in a different town so he used to come to my aunt.</span> <span id="s1165">Once in a while if I was there I saw them, and sure enough it was him and we got together and he didn't walk away from us for nothing.</span> <span id="s1166">After all, his brother is my uncle, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: It must have been pretty special to see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Let me tell you, in the camps, what they brought in from the concentration camps there were people that they were guards in the camps, you know, and they used to call them kapos.</span> <span id="s1169">You heard the name kapos?</span> <span id="s1170">They used to take -- the partisans used to take those guys and clobber them.</span> <span id="s1171">That's right, and then they would give them away to the American soldiers and let them handle them.</span> <span id="s1172">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">04:21:33</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: This was in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: In one place we must have slept maybe 500 people were in one room, a big one, a real big room.</span> <span id="s1176">It was in Bologna or in Modena, I don't remember, and everybody slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s1177">All 500 and somebody had to go to the washroom so they went, but then on the way back they don't know where their bunk is.</span> <span id="s1178">Sometimes they came to the wrong place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: So, for a while you were in a camp, until you got your villas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: You did stay in a DP camp for a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Yeah, I don't call it a, yeah, a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Some sort of camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1185">They gave you food to eat, you know.</span> <span id="s1186">Yeah, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: There you were with a lot of these concentration camp survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yes, we were mixed all together.</span> <span id="s1189">I mean, there was no different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: They had a very different story than you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Of course they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">04:22:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Was it surprising to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: No.</span> <span id="s1195">Knowing what Hitler can do, I wasn't surprised of anything.</span> <span id="s1196">But let me tell you one thing I know and I tell it to anybody, if you would not be fighting in a way, even though I didn't, I personally didn't fight, or some other people, but if it wouldn't be for the fighters, we would not survived.</span> <span id="s1197">They would have killed us one by one.</span> <span id="s1198">That's why I believe that people should be ready and don't call me a, a killer.</span> <span id="s1199">It's like, my husband says to me, "You're always afraid, even for a mouse.</span> <span id="s1200">But you're not afraid for me.</span> <span id="s1201">A fly you're afraid of, but not for me."</span> <span id="s1202">That's how much but no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1203">If you're going to sit and do nothing, nothing will happen, nothing will come good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: How many of the people who left your town and went to the forest, did most of them survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No.</span> <span id="s1206">No they didn't.</span> <span id="s1207">Some of them got infections, gangrene, and died.</span> <span id="s1208">Some of them had the typhoid and died, and some of them got killed in the battle fighting.</span> <span id="s1209">So there it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">04:24:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Okay, so you were in Italy, your original plan was to go to Palestine, but you came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: My husband has, had two uncles, three uncles and an aunt in Chicago so we changed our mind and we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Let me ask you just a couple of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: After all of this, is it important to you to be Jewish?</span> <span id="s1216">How do you feel about religion after all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: I am, I have mixed emotions.</span> <span id="s1218">I really mean it.</span> <span id="s1219">Why were we killed, for what?</span> <span id="s1220">And if you ask the rabbis that were sitting along the highway to wait to be killed, yes, ask them, they used to say we are the fortunate because they are going.</span> <span id="s1221">We're going to have a tough life left of us, you understand.</span> <span id="s1222">So, that's why I said I don't know.</span> <span id="s1223">Sometimes it's good and sometimes-- now I'll say that much.</span> <span id="s1224">I'm not a worldly person.</span> <span id="s1225">I'm not educated to the point, you know, where you can make a difference, but I think we Jews make our own problems.</span> <span id="s1226">I got, even though I'm wearing glasses, I can see very far and very good.</span> <span id="s1227">I really mean it.</span> <span id="s1228">Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1229">Now I'll ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1230">How come three million of the Jews were from Poland?</span> <span id="s1231">Hungary started in '43 they started to take them.</span> <span id="s1232">Now why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">04:26:47 Czechoslovakia didn't have it as bad either in comparison to the amount of Jews they had there.</span> <span id="s1234">Didn't die as many as by us.</span> <span id="s1235">They didn't kill them as much.</span> <span id="s1236">How come Poland's got three million and all the rest of the thirty little countries has three millions?</span> <span id="s1237">Can you tell me?</span> <span id="s1238">That's 31 countries.</span> <span id="s1239">Well, that's a good question, can you answer me that?</span> <span id="s1240">Well I don't know.</span> <span id="s1241">I'm not that smart and if, maybe I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1242">Maybe this generation.</span> <span id="s1243">See Polish Jews were different than the Jews from Russia, even though they were locked up.</span> <span id="s1244">We were different people, Hungary, Romania I don't know.</span> <span id="s1245">Still better than Poland.</span> <span id="s1246">Polish Jews I think are different all together, and I have a feeling this is why they killed three millions out of the Poles, Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1247">How come all the camps were in Poland?</span> <span id="s1248">Most of the camps were in Poland.</span> <span id="s1249">You tell me why?</span> <span id="s1250">And why they did not take from our sides, from Ukraine and Byelorussiadat, you know, that part.</span> <span id="s1251">They didn't take us to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1252">Some of them fell in so that by I don't know by what.</span> <span id="s1253">They needed so many people or something and they took them from one place and then they shipped them somewhere else so that maybe they wind up in a concentration camp, but they did not come to this town and take out so many on a train or whatever it is and send them to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1254">They used to make in every city.</span> <span id="s1255">You take Wilno, Pana (ph), Babi Yar, they killed them.</span> <span id="s1256">I don't, you tell me why.</span> <span id="s1257">Nobody can give me that answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">04:29:05</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: We have just a very little bit left on this tape.</span> <span id="s1260">Is there anything else you want to say, you want to add to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1262">We Jews are used to the pogroms, and pogroms, and pogroms.</span> <span id="s1263">All of Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s1264">That's why we ran away from Europe all together.</span> <span id="s1265">We didn't want that part.</span> <span id="s1266">Italy was a beautiful country and they were very nice to the Jews, even during the war.</span> <span id="s1267">If anybody had a business and left their manager run the business and if they did survive, they got back the store.</span> <span id="s1268">What did you get in Poland?</span> <span id="s1269">And everybody -- Russians are in Poland, Germany, what for?</span> <span id="s1270">I would make it a cemetery there.</span> <span id="s1271">It is.</span> <span id="s1272">Anyway, a Jewish cemetery might as well be their cemetery too.</span> <span id="s1273">Maybe I'm saying it wrong I don't know.</span> <span id="s1274">I'm not so smart but that's the way I feel.</span> <span id="s1275">I don't like violence.</span> <span id="s1276">It's not good, but if somebody goes to kill me, I want to make sure I'll kill him first.</span> <span id="s1277">This is my belief, but like I said.</span> <span id="s1278">Nobody can give me an answer why three million Polish Jews got killed.</span></p>
