Memorial Museum interview, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, this is a follow-up interview to an interview with Thomas Buergenthal conducted by Katie Davis in 1995.</span> <span id="s4">This follow-up interview is conducted by Regina Baier, with Judge Buergenthal, on February 27th, 2001.</span> <span id="s5">My first question is very open and we’ll see how simple it is.</span> <span id="s6">But it is, where are we?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Answer: We’re at the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, in my office at the court, on a very sort of dark, dre -- dreary day.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: And this is your place of work, and what do you do here, what is your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Well, my work on the court -- I’d have to actually go back and explain a little something about the court.</span> <span id="s10">The court was established already by the League of Nations in -- in early 1920’s.</span> <span id="s11">It’s a court where you deal only with disputes between states.</span> <span id="s12">And we also render advisory opinions for the United Nations, but basically disputes between states.</span> <span id="s13">We -- we have quite a number of cases pending now, and we hear cases.</span> <span id="s14">Since getting to the court in March, I’ve already sat on -- on five very important cases, including a case involving Germany and the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: That was a very good lead-in to a follow-up question I had.</span> <span id="s16">Could you give us one or two examples of the kinds of cases that you’re working on right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Ri -- at this very moment, actually, we -- we are in the process of finishing a dispute between Qatar and Bahrain, those are disputes relating to territorial and maritime -- the limitation questions.</span> <span id="s18">That is to say, the countries want the court to determine certain disputed issues relating to their territory and also to their -- their sea.</span> <span id="s19">At the same time we are dealing with a case between Germany and the United States in which Germany brought an action against the United States because of the execution of two young Germans who were not given -- or allegedly not given an opportunity to consult the German consular authorities.</span> <span id="s20">So the allegation is a breach of the -- of the Vienna convention on that subject.</span> <span id="s21">We’ve also recently dealt with a case that is still -- well, we’ll be hearing oral arguments involving an international arrest warrant issued by Belgium against the foreign minister -- former foreign minister of the Congo, charging him with crimes against humanity and war crimes.</span> <span id="s22">And the issue is whether Belgium had the right to -- to issue these -- these arrest warrants.</span> <span id="s23">So those are the type of cases we deal with, we -- the first case on which I sat here related to an aerial dispute between India and Pakistan.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And you took me on a lovely tour for the Peace Palace here, you mentioned as an aside that when you sp -- began working here.</span> <span id="s25">Or years ago, I forgot now, there were very few cases, you worked on just one or two, and now you have very m -- a lot of work to do.</span> <span id="s26">Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well, I of course am -- am new at the court, but in the days of the Cold War, basically since the second World War, initially there were very, very few cases coming, and that was because of the Cold War.</span> <span id="s28">And I think governments had the sense that this would be an ideologically divided court, and that justice would not really be done properly.</span> <span id="s29">Once the Cold War ended, cases started to come, and also I should tell you from what I’ve heard that the atmosphere on the court is very different than it was at the height of the Cold War.</span> <span id="s30">I-It’s a much easier, much more judicial type of -- of environment than it must have been, I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: When were you appointed?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I was elected by the United Nations on March second of 2000.</span> <span id="s33">And it’s interesting, the -- it’s an election both by the security council and the general assembly.</span> <span id="s34">By both bodies, voting separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And now you live in The Hague, or in [indecipherable] for good?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well, until my -- my term is up and -- but it seemed to u -- to my wife and me important that we be here in town while the court -- and -- and there is so much business now that one really couldn’t afford to be living in the United States and be sitting on this court.</span> <span id="s37">It’s basic -- it is a permanent court.</span> <span id="s38">And life in The Hague is -- it’s new for us, but very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What -- do you consider this -- this new work, or this job as sort of a crowning continuation of your very distinguished career in international law, and international human rights, or is it also -- or is it a difference -- somewhat different direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: In many ways it’s -- it’s a different direction.</span> <span id="s41">I’ve -- as you know, I -- I was a judge on the inter-American court of human rights.</span> <span id="s42">I’ve also sat on the UN Human Rights Committee.</span> <span id="s43">And thi -- this is very much an strictly international court, but human rights issues can arise, but a lot of other cases come as well.</span> <span id="s44">So, f-for an international lawyer like me, this is a dream court, and a dream come true.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Is it in some sense a relief not to be related so closely to very painful experiences, to -- or is it -- what do you mean when you say a dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: It’s a dream in the sense that I think there isn’t an international lawyer who wouldn’t want to be on this court, because it is really -- i-it’s like being on the Supreme Court of the United States.</span> <span id="s47">This is the court that determines what is and what is not international law.</span> <span id="s48">Not that we are that im-important, but in -- in terms of those of us who believe in international law, and -- and practice international law, this is the -- the Mecca to which you look.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Have you ever imagined that you would be in this position?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: N-Not at all.</span> <span id="s51">Well I -- as a matter of fact I was -- I-I visited -- I had a meeting at the court, not with the court but in the building, in November bef -- of 1999, and I had -- I didn’t at that point believe that I was going to be here.</span> <span id="s52">I -- I think it would be totally arrogant for anybody to believe that you’re going to be here.</span> <span id="s53">You dream about it.</span> <span id="s54">At my age you stop dreaming about it even, and then suddenly I -- I was named.</span> <span id="s55">Actually, I should tell you that the notice to me that I was going to be the nominee of the United States for the court came to me while I was -- had just done a visit to Auschwitz, my second visit.</span> <span id="s56">And I was in Kraków, had just come back from it, in the evening, in the hotel when I received the call from the legal advisory.</span> <span id="s57">That was very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Is it strange, or is it strangely appropriate that you are now living and working in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s60">My wife and I have always said that we -- that we could live almost ev -- anyplace, but I -- I think as we get older we probably should be a little more restrictive.</span> <span id="s61">But -- but it’s certainly a -- a -- one -- one couldn’t ask for a more enjoyable environment.</span> <span id="s62">We miss our children, we miss our grandchildren, we have eight grandchildren and they keep coming, so that part.</span> <span id="s63">But life here, and the working environment is certainly wonderful.</span> <span id="s64">I miss my students, actually.</span> <span id="s65">I don’t miss exams, I don’t miss that part, but I miss not having classes and seminars.</span> <span id="s66">Because this existence here, to some extent is quite lonely.</span> <span id="s67">Like many other judicial -- many other courts have this -- judges have that same experience.</span> <span id="s68">You work basically by yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: I guess my question was also aimed a little bit at knowing your background, that you originally came from Europe and now that you live in Europe again, did you ever have the desire never to live in Europe again or is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No, we -- w-we -- I’ve come back many a time.</span> <span id="s71">I didn’t think that I was going to live here.</span> <span id="s72">I -- I once had a possibility, it looked like a possibility to -- to serve on the European court of human rights, and we debated the issue of whether we would live in Europe.</span> <span id="s73">But it never seemed like a difficult choice if one had -- if the -- if what one was asked to do was interesting enough, the -- the living environment didn’t play that much of a role.</span> <span id="s74">But I must say, one couldn’t really ask for a nicer place to be than here in the -- in the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Now I would like to go back into the past, and I would like to ask you about the -- the time when you came over to America, about the boat trip, what you remember.</span> <span id="s76">You were 17 at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, it was in -- in December of 1951, that’s exactly 50 years ago this year.</span> <span id="s78">We were on one of the troop carriers, the transports, the liberty boats.</span> <span id="s79">It was the SS General Greeley, I still remember the name.</span> <span id="s80">And I think it was a -- a 10 day trip from Bremerhaven to -- to New York, with a lot of refugees, people from all over, from eastern Europe, [indecipherable] even -- I have some pictures still.</span> <span id="s81">And it was a very scary experience except that I knew I was coming to -- to live with my uncle, and in that sense it -- it -- and I was young, so it wasn’t as scary as what it must have been for -- for a lot of other people.</span> <span id="s82">But also the life on the boat was very interested.</span> <span id="s83">I -- I managed to get myself a interpreter’s job so I didn’t have to paint and scrub the floors.</span> <span id="s84">And it was a lot of fun, and va -- I was writing for the -- for the news -- ship newspaper.</span> <span id="s85">So from that point of view it was all exciting.</span> <span id="s86">I really had no idea what awaited me in the United States, whether I would stay in the United States.</span> <span id="s87">It was adventure at the age of 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Why were you supposed to -- I -- were ev -- was everybody supposed to -- to work there?</span> <span id="s89">Was it because you didn’t have money for the fare, or wa -- just --</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: It was strange, we got on the boat and people were told they had to scrub the decks, paint the ship and do all these things.</span> <span id="s91">But they needed people who could annou -- make announcements in different languages and so I volunteered for that.</span> <span id="s92">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Looks like you’re a survivor of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: It -- it was -- it -- well, at least it kept me above deck, which -- which was nicer then, because the ship was very crowded.</span> <span id="s95">One thing that we were all served American food, of course, for breakfast and they had these lovely boxes of cereal, these single cereal things.</span> <span id="s96">None of us knew what to do with that, and so after we ate breakfast, we hi -- we carry -- walked around with these boxes and thought that that was dessert.</span> <span id="s97">That’s what I remember from my ship experience.</span> <span id="s98">But arriving in New York, you know, the -- and we -- we s -- we sat -- we actually arrived in the evening, so we -- we weren’t unloaded, couldn’t disembark until the next morning.</span> <span id="s99">And to see New York with the -- all the lights and everything, was quite -- i-in some ways exciting, in some ways it brought back memories of the past, and I -- I’ve often thought about that -- that moment, and it’s -- it’s further and further away now, I had to reread what I had written at -- at that moment about it.</span> <span id="s100">But I think -- when I saw the lights, I thought of the crematories in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: You -- you did write an article for -- for a -- could you s-say that you wrote an article about a newspaper, or something?</span> <span id="s102">Or several people actually put together a newspaper, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes, wh-what we did on this ship, we put together a newspaper in all the languages that were represented on the ship, and I think there must have been 37 different languages.</span> <span id="s104">Some had to be handwritten because there were no -- no typewriters in those languages.</span> <span id="s105">I -- I wrote it in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Who -- who got the -- who got those newspapers, actually, in the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Everybody on the ship.</span> <span id="s108">I still have mine.</span> <span id="s109">I -- I found a copy the other day.</span> <span id="s110">That’s the advantage of moving around, because you find things you think you’ve lost many, many years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: So then you arrived, and you were picked up by family?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: No, I -- I wa -- I -- I -- I was picked up by a Jewish social service organization.</span> <span id="s113">The -- there must have been some sort of quarantine system, because I came over on the U.S. -- rather, children’s displaced person quota.</span> <span id="s114">And wi -- I -- I spend a few days in a home in the Bronx where we were.</span> <span id="s115">I don’t know wh -- what the purpose was, and it was there that my uncle then came and -- and picked me up.</span> <span id="s116">But there were quite a number of kids who had ri -- arrived a little earlier, who were Americans already because they’d come there a few weeks before I did, and showed me New York.</span> <span id="s117">But then my uncle came and -- and picked me up.</span> <span id="s118">And then I -- I lived for a year and a half in New Jersey with my uncle, in Patterson, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Quick question, what did they show you in New York?</span> <span id="s120">Did anything happen -- I mean, did you understand what you were supposed to do in this weird place?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well the -- I -- I -- for one thing, we -- we got on the subway and they got out of the train and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s122">And I didn’t know where I was and where I was going and what the address was.</span> <span id="s123">But the impressive thing to me were, of course, at that time, coming from Europe, to see these big cars in America, and these big buildings.</span> <span id="s124">It di -- wonders to -- it was a marvel, you just couldn't get over it, that sort of life.</span> <span id="s125">And also the thing that, to me, somebody who’s gone through the camp was the most striking, if you ordered a salami sandwich, you got about an inch of salami, whereas I remember at home, i-if you were lucky you got a very thin slice of whatever meat there was on the -- on the sandwich.</span> <span id="s126">Or liverwurst sandwiches.</span> <span id="s127">And ice cream.</span> <span id="s128">Those were things that I just hadn’t seen and couldn’t believe that that existed.</span> <span id="s129">So that was the most impressive part.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Was eating important to you then, for -- for awhile at least?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">Not so much eating as knowing that -- that there were all these things that were available.</span> <span id="s133">And in the Bronx, at that point, there were just about every second store and restaurant had a kosher sign outside the door.</span> <span id="s134">If you asked somebody f-for instructions in English, they answered you in Yiddish, or in some other language.</span> <span id="s135">It was a very different life from -- I -- I came from Greding in -- which is my mother’s home town.</span> <span id="s136">All of this was just like having come into totally different worlds.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: You did not speak Yiddish, you spoke -- do you speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I spoke ger -- yes, I understand Yiddish, I can speak it if I have to, but it’s -- it’s really a distorted German, more than -- than proper Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Did you get along with your uncle?</span> <span id="s140">How was it living ow -- living there, and what happened with regard to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Oh no, I got along wonderful there, they are wonderful people.</span> <span id="s142">My -- my uncle is my -- the brother of my mother, and they had -- th-they were not well off, really.</span> <span id="s143">My -- my uncle, and my aunt worked in a -- in a textile factory at the time, and my uncle in a aircraft factory and they had a little daughter there tha -- when I came that -- we didn’t have an extra room for me.</span> <span id="s144">But they -- they shared everything with me, and -- and took me in, and -- and really were my parents for -- for that period of time.</span> <span id="s145">I arrived, as I mentioned, in December.</span> <span id="s146">I was in school already in January, in high school in Patterson, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s147">And I was given one of these strange tests, because the -- the teachers didn’t know, you know, where I came from -- I’d had very little schooling before, anyway.</span> <span id="s148">I -- I went to high school in Germany, but -- for two and a half years, and I had a year of private tutoring.</span> <span id="s149">So they didn’t know where I would fit in.</span> <span id="s150">So I would meet with different teachers from -- or heads of departments, say math department, English department.</span> <span id="s151">And they would give me, sort of tests on their own or speak to me, and so -- and then they decided where to put me, and they put me in the junior class.</span> <span id="s152">And then, you know, I -- I graduated there in -- in a year and a half and went to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: How did you get along with your classmates, I mean could you -- did you relate, did they -- did you talk about where you came from at all?</span> <span id="s154">Did you understand where they were coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh they just looked -- you know, th-this was some -- in those days there were not very many foreigners.</span> <span id="s156">So I was the green immigrant.</span> <span id="s157">Everybody asked you how do you like America, and I hadn’t seen much of anything.</span> <span id="s158">But no, they were extremely friendly, except for the fact that they tried to sell me elevator tickets, they were all very nice, and I -- I participated in sports, I -- on -- on the varsity team, and -- no, I felt very much at home within -- very reason -- very short time, and the teachers were just wonderful, I must say th-the cr -- the climate was so different from Germany.</span> <span id="s159">The -- the school in Germany was very formal, the teachers -- everything was done in a very disciplined, formal way.</span> <span id="s160">This sort of class president or speaker was designated by the -- by the teacher.</span> <span id="s161">And there was this very democratic life in -- in the American, everything was voted on.</span> <span id="s162">The academics may not have been as high possibly as in -- as in Germany, but as a -- as a teaching ground for -- for democracy, it -- it was quite an experience, it opened my eyes to -- to what a good high school can do in teaching citizenship more than necessarily academics.</span> <span id="s163">So i-it was a great experience, I found the teachers extremely helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Did -- did you ever speak about your experience, or did you have a desire even to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No, I didn’t, actually.</span> <span id="s166">But what was interesting when I reflect -- you ask this question about it now.</span> <span id="s167">Nobody really wanted to know in those days about the past.</span> <span id="s168">Nobody asked.</span> <span id="s169">They wanted to know where I came from, what I did, and when they -- a-and -- but it went sort of -- it was like asking how are you, you know, you don’t really expect, for one, to get an answer.</span> <span id="s170">And no, it -- it -- it really, there was no great interest in finding out, it was just here was somebody new, he’s come to America and he is now our buddy and that was it.</span> <span id="s171">But no interest.</span> <span id="s172">I mean, the interest, it’s suddenly over the last 10 years in -- in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s173">It was totally nonexistent e-even among older people.</span> <span id="s174">Even my -- my uncle and aunt, my uncle comes from Greding, and my aunt from Berlin.</span> <span id="s175">They had a club of basically German Jews who -- who’d come from there.</span> <span id="s176">They took me in, but nobody really asked where I was, or cared.</span> <span id="s177">That came -- I think you -- much, much, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Do you think it had to do with not wanting to hurt you, or was it just they did not really have a full understanding of -- of what happened, and just wanted to kind of let it be, or was it also th-the 50’s to some degree, it wasn’t done then?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yeah, I -- I think -- no, they had an understanding because many of them, of course, had come -- my uncle came to the U.S. in ’38, which was already quite late.</span> <span id="s180">No, it -- it wasn’t that I -- I -- and I don’t think that it was that they’d wanted to hurt me.</span> <span id="s181">They were just too busy making a living, and life was pretty hard.</span> <span id="s182">They had come, like my uncle and aunt at the -- during the depression basically, it wasn’t easy -- it wasn’t an easy life, they came with nothing.</span> <span id="s183">And the others were in the same -- same boat, and they -- they still -- I mean, they would eat on a Saturday or Sunday morning, they would eat all the things that they would have eaten in Germany, and -- but -- but one didn’t very much discuss the war at all.</span> <span id="s184">Maybe they didn’t want to be reminded of it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: So you graduated from high school, and what were your plans?</span> <span id="s186">You wanted to go to college?</span> <span id="s187">If so, was it easy to get in?</span> <span id="s188">A: Well, I have -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: I’m sorry, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: -- I have to tell you f-funny stories about this, because first of all the -- the Jewish social service person who was supposed to be in charge of me in Patterson, New Jersey said to me, “Oh, you want to go to college, but in America you cannot do that.</span> <span id="s191">You have to go and work first and earn enough money to go to school.”</span> <span id="s192">Well, that was the last I ever went to see her again, because I didn’t -- I thought that was just a complete waste of time to get that sort of advice.</span> <span id="s193">I -- I -- I did well in -- wi -- my grades were good, and I had a very good advisor in the -- a college advisor i-in the school.</span> <span id="s194">And she said -- and I knew I wanted to go to college, I mean there was no question that I wanted to do it, and how I was going to do it, that was another thing, but I knew I was going to do it.</span> <span id="s195">A -- so she said, well, I’ll give you -- and I had no idea how you went about it, I -- you know, i -- and since my relatives had not gone to college here, they ha -- couldn’t really advise me.</span> <span id="s196">So the -- the advisor, the academic advisor said, “I’ll give you the names of 10 schools.</span> <span id="s197">And they are smaller schools because it would be better for you to go to a smaller college where they’d have -- where you’d get acclimated, you’d be part of amer,” -- which was very wise advice.</span> <span id="s198">And she gave me those 10 schools, and I -- and she told me what to do, so you write in and I asked for the catalog.</span> <span id="s199">I did that, and I -- and da -- there was some very fine schools like Colgate, Hamilton College and s-schools of that type.</span> <span id="s200">And one of the schools was Bethany College in -- in West Virginia.</span> <span id="s201">The other schools that I’d written to, most of them with -- I knew I couldn’t go unless I had a scholarship.</span> <span id="s202">All the other schools admitted me, but they said we can only give you a scholarship in th -- in a year when we know how your academic performance is going to be, which I guess made sense because I really didn’t much of an academic pedigree.</span> <span id="s203">But it meant that I really couldn't -- couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s204">And Bethany College was a school to which I’d written and asked for the catalog.</span> <span id="s205">The catalog came back and it started out by saying this is a Christian college, and so coming from Europe I assumed that that was not a college where they wanted me.</span> <span id="s206">And so I didn’t do anything, I put it aside.</span> <span id="s207">Then one day in -- when I was in class in high school, I get a call from the academic advisor saying that there is somebody from Bethany College downstairs in her office and he wants to speak to me.</span> <span id="s208">So I went and spoke with him, and the first thing he said to me was, “Why didn’t you send -- fill out your application?”</span> <span id="s209">And I wasn’t quite sure how to put this, because it was a little delicate, and finally I said, “Look, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s210">You are a Christian college, and I imagine you’d -- you wouldn’t want me.”</span> <span id="s211">And he said, “Well, you’re missing the point, this is America, w-we -- we -- we find your background interesting, we want you to come, we can arrange scholarships for you, and if you work, you can -- and none of this costs too much, you could come to Bethany with no money at all and get through school.”</span> <span id="s212">And they were -- so I applied, I got the scholarship, they -- they gave me a job and for the next three and a half years I spend one semester in Washington.</span> <span id="s213">I was there and loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: And it was in West Virginia?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: In West Virginia.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: There are two Bethanys, but th -- the one I went to was in West Virginia, it’s a Disciples of Christ school, and I must say it was the most tolerant environment from a religious point of view, any place where I’ve ever been.</span> <span id="s218">So it -- it was a -- and it was actually very good for me because it was small enough in those days, the entire college had 500 or 550 students.</span> <span id="s219">I had some classes with professors where there were just two of us.</span> <span id="s220">And French literature, or German literature, there were just -- or in history of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s221">So it -- it was a very good experience for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: What was sort of your -- your plans for life at that point?</span> <span id="s223">Was there a strong focus on wanting to get a profession or did you also start to live, in terms of parties, friends, what -- whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: No, I knew -- I knew that if I was going to get any place, I really had to have top grades.</span> <span id="s225">Which doesn’t mean that I lived the life of -- of a monk, but I -- I worked pretty hard.</span> <span id="s226">And it wasn’t that easy, English was -- so I had to really learn to read and write English, and so it took -- took a lot of work.</span> <span id="s227">But it was most interesting, I -- I found, for example, I -- I found American history extremely interesting, I -- and -- and I -- I majored in history and sort of emphasized American history, political science, were the things that I just found fascinating.</span> <span id="s228">So i-it was a lot work, a lot of time, but it was also -- it wasn’t -- I wasn’t bored, I -- it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s229">And I had minored in -- in English, so that I could read things that I wanted to read, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: And then you went onto law school.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Then I went onto law s --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: NYU?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yes, but there is another story to it.</span> <span id="s234">I was -- I g -- I graduated first from Bethany College, and Bethany College recommended me for the Rhodes Scholarship.</span> <span id="s235">And -- but I wasn’t a citizen yet.</span> <span id="s236">So the initial recommendation went to the state of West Virginia, and the person in charge meant I was already qualified to be a citizen so they rushed through my citizenship to qualify me for the -- for the Rhodes Scholarship, and then I went and part -- and participated in the interview for the regional Rhodes Scholarship.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: -- and the big problem was that they asked me a lot of questions, but one question which I couldn’t answer satisfactorily, they said, “Why do you want to go to England, to Oxford?</span> <span id="s239">You just got here.”</span> <span id="s240">And I couldn’t -- I couldn’t -- I hemmed and hawed, but the truth was that why would I want to go to Oxford if I wanted to be a lawyer in the United States?</span> <span id="s241">So I didn’t get the scholarship, not -- not surprisingly.</span> <span id="s242">But on the way out, as I was walking out, one of the members of the committee said to me, “I’d like to recommend you for a scholarship at New York University.”</span> <span id="s243">And that was the route til -- the scholarship at New York University, for which I applied, and -- and which I then was awarded.</span> <span id="s244">And it paid for my entire three years of law school.</span> <span id="s245">And in those -- it was unbelievable because it paid for -- for everything, and I had 72 dollars a month spending money, books or whatever, which I was the ri -- I was richer than I’ve ever been before.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Now, I don’t ask you what did you do to deserve that honor, I ask you what did you -- how did you get their attention, what did you do so well?</span> <span id="s247">I mean, was it the grades, or was it also a particular interest in certain areas, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well the -- the -- the Ruth Tilden scholarship was relatively new in those days and you had to -- you had to have a -- your -- grades was one consideration, but also general interest in the -- career interest that -- that were different, backgrounds that were different.</span> <span id="s249">And there were -- we were selected on the basis, again, two people from each judicial circuit in the United States.</span> <span id="s250">And the selection was made actually wi -- wi -- usually presided over by a committee that was chaired by the chief justice of a federal -- of a court of appeals in that judicial district.</span> <span id="s251">In my case it was in Richmond, Virginia.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: So you were interested in law at that point already.</span> <span id="s253">Why law?</span> <span id="s254">And I think you were also already interested in international law.</span> <span id="s255">Was that true at that time, or was it -- did it come later with Harvard?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No, I was interested -- I -- I always thought at this point already that I would do something where I could use my languages and my -- my -- and my interest in international affairs and -- and politics.</span> <span id="s257">I knew I was -- wanted to do something in -- in international already in -- when I was in law school -- and I almost left law school because th-the first year particularly there was nothing that was international and it was quite depressing.</span> <span id="s258">But then with every year in law school, I -- I got more interested in it.</span> <span id="s259">And then I knew that once I got my basic law degree, th-the juris doctor degree, that I wanted to do -- to specialize more, because we only had one course in international law in my law school during my time.</span> <span id="s260">And that’s when I went on -- I went on to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: You had specialized at that time already in international law, and you were also interested in -- in human rights, international human rights at that point.</span> <span id="s262">What was sort of the standing -- you alluded to it a little bit already, but what was sort of the standing of international law within the law community?</span> <span id="s263">Was it -- didn’t -- did it play a bigger -- a bigger role?</span> <span id="s264">Was it popular?</span> <span id="s265">Was it just beginning to -- to come up, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: The truth of the matter is that if you as a law student were interested in international things, you had no chance in hell to get a job in an int -- in a f -- in a law firm, because they thought that you were just interested in traveling.</span> <span id="s267">International was just a luxury that you -- you didn’t practice international law, at least according to the -- to the people in -- in these law firms.</span> <span id="s268">And so, you know, if -- if you expressed an interest in international like I did, you were looked upon as some odd character, and they didn’t expect you to have much of a chance of getting anything.</span> <span id="s269">As a matter of fact, when I was once asked to interview in one firm, my friends advised me for heaven’s sake, don’t say anything about international, that you’re interested in that.</span> <span id="s270">Say you want to be a tough corporate lawyer, and then, you know, you might slip in the fact that you have some interest in international, but never say that’s what you want to do.</span> <span id="s271">So in that sense, things have changed tremendously in the United States.</span> <span id="s272">Today, law firms take great pride in the fact that they have international law departments.</span> <span id="s273">But in -- in my day, there just didn’t -- didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s274">Even though there were a number of law firms that were doing international work, but they didn’t see it th-that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Now, that you recognized the potential in this field, s -- at such a young age, do you think that had also to do with your Holocaust experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I think so -- I -- I must say, I didn’t recognize the potential as -- as I recognized that I was going to do what I wanted to do in terms of my own career plans.</span> <span id="s277">And I -- I feel very strongly that I should do something in the international area where I had to -- where I felt that I had -- could make a contribution.</span> <span id="s278">So I was going to do that, regardless of -- of the -- of the obstacles.</span> <span id="s279">And I -- I figured I was going to be able to do it, I mean in retrospect you sort of wonder how foolish one was to think that one could do those things, because it -- i-it -- if you think of all the obstacles that -- that were there, you m -- you might have decided to do something altogether different.</span> <span id="s280">But I just couldn’t see myself practicing -- practicing law.</span> <span id="s281">I -- I wanted to do something where I -- where I could sort of -- where I had an advantage in many ways, and where I thought I -- I could do some good.</span> <span id="s282">And to practice law like everybody else, I -- I didn’t have much of a contribution to make, and I wasn’t going to find it very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: But it wasn’t just specialize in international law, it was also specializing -- specializing in human rights, which wasn’t exactly on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: No, that didn’t even exist, and there I -- it started out, I think, with the perception -- I-I don’t know, I’ve often been asked, wa -- is it my experience that drove me to it.</span> <span id="s285">I wou -- I’m never quite sure.</span> <span id="s286">But i -- what I think is true is this, that I felt from my concentration camp experience, where we always looked to the U.S. and to England to save us, really, that one had -- that in a situation where one was in trouble from a human rights point of view, one couldn’t rely on the domestic scene or the domestic environment.</span> <span id="s287">And you had to look -- you had to have some international mechanisms that could protect you.</span> <span id="s288">And so I was fascinated to see what was happening in those early days.</span> <span id="s289">This was in the -- in the late 50’s.</span> <span id="s290">Really, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been adopted in ’48, but nothing much was happening.</span> <span id="s291">And then in the early 50’s, the European Convention on Human Rights came into being.</span> <span id="s292">And I was fascinated, I wanted to see how did this work, really?</span> <span id="s293">Is there a chance that this might prevent what I went through?</span> <span id="s294">And that began to interest me, but it wasn’t only human rights, it was also -- and this is fascinating considering where I am today -- what also interested me was international tribunals.</span> <span id="s295">As a matter of fact I did my master’s thesis at Harvard on the European court of the -- of the -- the common market court.</span> <span id="s296">Bec -- I was fascinated to see how this court operated.</span> <span id="s297">It -- it wasn’t until a little later that I got interested in the work of the European Court of Human Rights.</span> <span id="s298">But it was the europ -- what is today called the European Court of Justice, and in the early days it was still the [indecipherable] community court.</span> <span id="s299">That’s what I wrote on, is how they went about forcing governments to comply with their decisions.</span> <span id="s300">So I was interested in compliance mechanisms, how international institutions can have an impact on -- on states and on individuals, and protect individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So from the very beginning really, bringing two things together, which is the academic interest on the one hand, but also very practical how -- how could policy be influenced, how could -- how could it become a tool, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s303">I -- wi -- yo -- when you said only academics, the truth of the matter is that I wasn’t sure I was going to go into teaching.</span> <span id="s304">It was a p -- s -- a-actually an accident that I ended up in teaching, because I -- I was at that point working on my masters at Harvard and there was a -- and I thought of a government job, or a corporate job in international, and there was an opening at -- at the -- wi -- in the U.S. government for an international lawyer who spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s305">And because the U.S. had just signed an agreement, a compensation agreement with Poland, and I -- I knew I could get the job because there weren’t very many people around.</span> <span id="s306">So I applied for that job, and -- but they had their usual government budget problems, and I was told the job was mine, the -- if the budget came through.</span> <span id="s307">And so I waited and waited for the -- for the job and it was about March or April and people around me were getting very nervous and I still didn’t have a job.</span> <span id="s308">Then one day a visiting professor from the University of Pennsylvania, who was visiting at Harvard, came in and said, “I heard you’re still waiting for a job.</span> <span id="s309">We have a one year teaching job for legal method, available at the University of Pennsylvania, and if you want it, it’s yours.”</span> <span id="s310">So that’s how I got into teaching.</span> <span id="s311">And I was teaching legal method, which is really -- the most boring thing is to teach people how to write like lawyers and to research law.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: [indecipherable] on the teaching aspect, I just want to throw in two questions that are related not to Harvard, but to the period, to the time, which is the early 60’s.</span> <span id="s313">Did you follow the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: What -- what -- what -- did that have any kind of impact, did you analyze it in some way, or what was sort of your relation to -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I had a very, I suppose, idiosyncratic approach to the Eichmann trial, in which I got into trouble with a lot of people who couldn’t understand my point of view.</span> <span id="s317">I thought it was not a good idea for Israel to try Eichmann.</span> <span id="s318">I thought it would have been better for Germany to try Eichmann, because -- I -- I must say, the fact that Germany didn’t have the death penalty, or that Israel had, that is totally irrelevant from my point of view, because whether you kill him or give him a life sentence, y-you’re not going to make up for -- for what he’s done and you’re not going to revive the people that died.</span> <span id="s319">But symbolically it was very important, I thought, for Germany to face up to this horrendous -- to what this man had done.</span> <span id="s320">And so doing it in Israel, while the trial was fair and everything else, was not the same.</span> <span id="s321">I-It didn’t achieve in my view -- it may have educated Israelis to what happened, but they didn’t really need to be educated as much as the Germans needed to be educated.</span> <span id="s322">So I’ve always thought that was a mistake.</span> <span id="s323">I thought German -- the Israelis should have handed him over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s324">I don’t think the Germans wanted him, and si -- th-that’s the problem -- that was Germany’s problem, but not -- not our problem.</span> <span id="s325">So th-th-that was my approach to -- to the Eichmann case.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s327">The other question was late 60’s, mid-60’s, what impact did the civil rights movement have on you, if any?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Well the -- i-in a sense, not very much.</span> <span id="s329">You know, in some ways I was already more preoccupied with what was happening on the outside.</span> <span id="s330">On one hand.</span> <span id="s331">On the other hand, the -- the civil rights -- I mean, I was shocked when I came to America that you s -- one still had separate fountains and all of that.</span> <span id="s332">You know, coming from where I came from, ou-out of a Nazi concentration camp, and finding these terrible things that people -- for example, the movie house in West Virginia, African-Americans had to sit on one side of the movie house, and -- and whites on the other, I mean that to me was shocking, I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s333">As a matter of fact, the water fountains in Virginia when I went for an interview were still -- still had segregated signs on it.</span> <span id="s334">That was just totally, you know, shocking to me.</span> <span id="s335">But I didn’t -- you know, I didn’t get into it, into the civil rights movement.</span> <span id="s336">I -- I believe very much in what -- what was -- what they were doing.</span> <span id="s337">But it wasn’t something I’d -- I had much to contribute to.</span> <span id="s338">And so I didn’t get -- get involved in it.</span> <span id="s339">Emotionally I was involved, but not really.</span> <span id="s340">I mean, I was there in spirit, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: That’s fair enough.</span> <span id="s342">Okay, let’s go into teaching a little bit.</span> <span id="s343">You were a reluctant teacher at first, but then you became quite an inspired teacher in terms of trying to get the two fields that you had chosen, international law, and human rights -- international human rights law incorporated, or strengthened in the curricula and so on.</span> <span id="s344">Could you speak a little bit about the development of your aspirations or your interest as a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Well, once I started teaching at the University of Pennsylvania I -- i-in that one year, I knew I -- that’s where I belonged, and I knew then what I was going to teach.</span> <span id="s346">And actually, the courses I wanted to teach are -- interesting reas -- I wanted to teach about the European Union, th-the Common Market, which was in those days a really revolutionary development.</span> <span id="s347">When you think that Germany and France could get together after the second World War, and create this union with this purpose, and the European and human rights, of course, the mo -- the emphasis on the European c-convention, and international law, the UN.</span> <span id="s348">To some extent, to -- I think to many people, all of this seemed to be -- certainly it wasn’t bread and butter for most law students.</span> <span id="s349">They wanted torts, contracts, property law.</span> <span id="s350">And you know, I d -- I tried to make it as interesting as possible, and I suppose since it was interesting to me, that I was enthusiastic about it, I could always get some students interested in it.</span> <span id="s351">But at first when you started -- my -- my first real teaching job after Pennsylvania, which was a one year wel -- was at the State University of New York in -- in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s352">And I was told when I was hired that I would get one course, and the three other courses would have to be in American domestic law.</span> <span id="s353">And two of those were courses I’d never even had in law school.</span> <span id="s354">So it was only gradually that I was allowed -- that -- that there was any interest in the curriculum to add courses in international law.</span> <span id="s355">And t --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Were there textbooks, actually?</span> <span id="s357">On human rights, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: No, I actually -- together with a former Harvard pr-professor of mine, we wrote the first American international human rights case book.</span> <span id="s359">It was published in ’73 and that really started teaching of international human rights in American law schools.</span> <span id="s360">Before that, there were three people teaching human rights in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Say something a little bit about that teacher, because he seemed to have had an impact on you, and he was an important person.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yeah -- yes, the -- th-the teacher was -- was Professor Louis Soane at the Harvard Law School, who i-inspired me f -- f -- and has been sort of my -- was my mentor for -- for many, many years, and a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s363">The background is interesting.</span> <span id="s364">He came to the United States in ’39 from Poland.</span> <span id="s365">Had a terribly hard time, ended up holding the most important chair at -- at the Harvard Law School in international law.</span> <span id="s366">A-And was a pragmatic idealist, if you -- if there is such a thing.</span> <span id="s367">A person who always -- others thought he just -- he was just way ou -- out of it.</span> <span id="s368">Yet, he always proved to be right, five, six, 10 years later.</span> <span id="s369">About the UN, about human rights, about international developments.</span> <span id="s370">And I found -- when I found him, I found a -- a spirit that could inspire me.</span> <span id="s371">So it -- and he is still alive, he is 87 years old.</span> <span id="s372">When he retired from Harvard he went initially to Georgia and then I managed to talk him into coming to George Washington University, where he’s been as distinguished research scholar, professor and still a person from whom I learn a great deal when I see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: You also managed to twist a few arms at the American Society of International Law to allow you to establish a study panel because you thought that was important.</span> <span id="s374">Could you say something about the panel that you established and why it was important to you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes, in -- during the period in -- in the 60’s, really, the American Society of International Law was very traditional, conservative if you will.</span> <span id="s376">And human rights, international human rights law was not really considered law.</span> <span id="s377">It wasn’t my -- the -- the older professors who -- who were the establishment in this society just didn’t believe that -- that that was really something that the society should be studying, this -- this was politics.</span> <span id="s378">And Professor Soane actually encouraged me to write a memorandum to the society, saying that a study panel should be established, and in those days the Ford Foundation was funding these study panels.</span> <span id="s379">Th -- asked me to -- suggested that I write this memorandum, urging the establishment of the study panel, and lo and behold, despite some opposition from various people in -- in the society, the panel was established, and it gave a legitimacy, a credibility to human rights as a -- as a discipline, or branch of international law, which was very important because the society -- the American Society of International Law is a -- is a sort of the body of the United States that determines what is and what isn’t international law, and what is important.</span> <span id="s380">And we brought together 30 - some people and produced various papers and held conferences and regionals.</span> <span id="s381">And sort of put human rights, gradually, on that little map.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Okay, I would like to divert -- divert --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: You want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: No, I don’t want to, necessarily, but w-would you like one?</span> <span id="s385">I just want to switch to your private life now for a change, and then go back to UNESCO and all the other wonderful things that we can talk about.</span> <span id="s386">But what happened in the meantime?</span> <span id="s387">So you had definitely your vision fairly clear, on what it is that you wanted to do in your career and your profession.</span> <span id="s388">What happened in the meantime?</span> <span id="s389">Did you have a -- a relationship of sorts?</span> <span id="s390">Did ha -- did you -- have you married, did you want to have a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Well, I -- I married in my third year in law school, and -- in 1959.</span> <span id="s392">Actually, wa -- i-it was very strange.</span> <span id="s393">The -- the scholarship that I was on, the Ruth Tilden scholarship, in those day di -- days, did not allow those of us who had scholarships to get married.</span> <span id="s394">The class ahead of us, in the third year, about six of them decided to get m -- and incidentally it was all male.</span> <span id="s395">No woman.</span> <span id="s396">Now it i -- now it’s a very different program, but in those days only males were admitted.</span> <span id="s397">And six of the upperclassmen got married in their third year.</span> <span id="s398">And they couldn't throw them all out because they would have thrown out one-third of the -- of the program.</span> <span id="s399">So they did the next best thing, which was to reduce the scholarship by 500 dollars or something like this, but they -- so the next class, when we -- when we got to this stage, I met my then wife, still in -- in Bethany College.</span> <span id="s400">She transferred to NYU where I was in -- in law school.</span> <span id="s401">And we got married actually in the law school, in -- in the dormitory by a judge who -- who had been my -- who was my sponsor.</span> <span id="s402">We -- and all my classmates from the program were -- were all there.</span> <span id="s403">And we were married in -- in ’59, then a -- we went together to Harvard in -- in ’60.</span> <span id="s404">Wi -- my -- my wife was a music teacher and we had a deal that we would -- we would start a family, or rather she would stop working when I earned about what -- a little more, about half more than sh -- what she was earning as a music teacher, which wasn’t very much so it wasn’t all that difficult in those days.</span> <span id="s405">She taught in -- in Cambridge while I went to -- while I was at -- at Harvard.</span> <span id="s406">And then when I got to the University of Pennsylvania, we decided at that point that we should start a -- a family.</span> <span id="s407">And our first son, our oldest son was still born in -- while we were in Philadelphia, so that was in 1962.</span> <span id="s408">Then we moved -- he was only six weeks old when we moved to Buffalo.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: What was -- what was her name, just for the record, and h -- and the name of the son?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Dorothy Coleman was her name.</span> <span id="s411">She came -- she was born in South Dakota, actually, but she lived -- family had moved to Seattle, Washington.</span> <span id="s412">And she was a musician, who basically had played in the Wheeling w -- symphony and decided then to teach music.</span> <span id="s413">And the -- my oldest son, his name is Robert, he is a lawyer, but not practicing, he works in Washington.</span> <span id="s414">And then in quick sus -- succession, the two other sons were born, John who -- who lives in Baltimore and has two children of his own.</span> <span id="s415">And Alan, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, who is a lawyer.</span> <span id="s416">Who just today just had a baby -- baby girl.</span> <span id="s417">John is a director of human resources for a company in -- in Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What did you like about each other when you met?</span> <span id="s419">What was the -- the attraction, and also then -- well, let me ask this first.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Well, what I -- what I found so interesting about her, I-I suppose it explains maybe -- she was so very American.</span> <span id="s421">That optimism, the -- the thing that there were no limits to what one could do.</span> <span id="s422">And she had actually been an exchange student in Germany.</span> <span id="s423">Quite early on she’d won a scholarship and she spent a year in Braunschweig living with a family and -- and spoke German, had been -- but she was so American in terms of -- of -- and that had a -- had a tremendous appeal to me, of course.</span> <span id="s424">It was so different.</span> <span id="s425">None of the repressive things that -- you know, th-the -- my earlier girlfriends, who still had European backgrounds, they were very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Okay, at -- oh, one question -- I was just so absorbed in da -- nodding my head here, that I forgot my question, but the question was, did you talk about where you were coming from, did -- did -- was that -- did that come up, sort of step by step, or did you not really touch much on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Oh yes, no, we talked a great deal about it, because actually I started writing some of my experiences about that time, writing them down.</span> <span id="s428">A -- as -- I’d written one article about the Death March already in college, but all the other pieces that I wrote, she actually typed and -- and revised, edited them.</span> <span id="s429">And so we -- we talked about -- about that quite a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: And she was -- and she was a sort of underst -- I mean, y-you felt that she was unders -- sort of trying to understand?</span> <span id="s431">Did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Oh yes, no, she understood, and the fact that she’d lived in Europe -- no, she ha -- she was -- she was in many ways much more understanding than many people -- many other people I -- I met.</span> <span id="s433">I mean, she took this -- she knew -- she knew my mother, she could -- you know, she had heard all the stories and -- no, there was -- no, I’ve -- I’ve never had the feeling -- first of all, she -- she was always interested in it, and she had a -- well, she -- she was very impressive in -- in those days when really most people weren’t interested in any of that.</span> <span id="s434">She -- she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: On that positive note, I shall change the tape.</span> <span id="s436">This is the end of tape one, follow-up interview with Judge Buergenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: And this is tape two of the follow-up interview with Judge Buergenthal, conducted by Regina Baier on February 27th, 2001.</span> <span id="s439">And in 1970, I believe, I seem to remember in 1970 you began representing the U.S. government at the UNESCO in human rights matters.</span> <span id="s440">And how did that come about and what -- could you give us an example of the kind of things that you were involved in then.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes, it -- it was around in the early 1970’s, that I -- I was teaching -- at that point I was still teaching at Buffalo, at the state university of New York, and one of the lawyers in town who became a good friend of mine was -- received a political appointment to serve on the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission.</span> <span id="s442">And he knew very little about international human rights, but was very interested.</span> <span id="s443">And so he asked me to brief him, and give him backgrounds on -- on what was happening in the human rights field in the world at the time, which I did.</span> <span id="s444">And then after that experience that he had, he became a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, which was sort of the state department’s private support body for -- for UNESCO.</span> <span id="s445">And he involved me in the work, and he -- he is -- he became the chairman of their human rights committee, and made me a member of the -- of the committee.</span> <span id="s446">And than I was elected, eventually, to the -- to the U.S. national commission, and then I succeeded him as -- as chairman of the commission.</span> <span id="s447">In the meantime, in 1974, I was asked to chair a U.S. delegation to a UNESCO meeting.</span> <span id="s448">And what we were doing there basically -- this was of course at the height of the -- of Cold War, were the -- human rights was not something -- human rights was basically used in many quarters just as a propaganda tool, one way or the other.</span> <span id="s449">And m-my delegation, we -- we tried to -- to do it right.</span> <span id="s450">We -- we managed to get -- they had a draft that had been prepared, we managed to get 82 amendments adopted for it.</span> <span id="s451">My -- my -- my colleague at the time was a -- was a professor of child psychology who had done a lot of work on children’s attitudes -- international attitudes.</span> <span id="s452">And we worked this -- and we lobbied, and we managed to actually get a great deal done, to everybody’s surprise because I think when we were put on this delegation everybody thought this was just giving a few people a free trip to Paris, but nothing was going to come out of it.</span> <span id="s453">And when we came back, we suggested to the U.S. government -- because we then managed to adopt the resolution that -- that should be written up.</span> <span id="s454">The -- and the -- the people at the state department, in charge of UNESCO said to us, well why don’t you write it up?</span> <span id="s455">And that produced a book on this recommendation that had been -- that had been adopted, and led to my involvement and -- on human rights issues -- anything relating to human rights at UNESCO at that point, I was involved in one way or the other.</span> <span id="s456">Eventually, up to really 1960 -- no, let me see, ’78 - ’79, when I was elected to the inter-American court, and I was -- I dre -- I was part of the -- I was th -- chairing the delegation of the U.S. that managed to adopt rules for private appeals to UNESCO for human rights violations.</span> <span id="s457">Again things that nobody thought we were going to be able to get through, but it was adopted.</span> <span id="s458">It was very exciting, it was my first experience in an international gu -- inter-governmental forum.</span> <span id="s459">And that’s where I began, really, to get some practical experience in international human rights as a government representative.</span> <span id="s460">And it was -- wa -- in sense, wonderful to be there representing the -- the U.S. because I could see my colleagues from the east particularly, who had to continuously check their instructions and had to adhere to their instructions and I also had the feeling that if they made a mistake they would end up being in Siberia, whereas all that could happen to me would be that I wouldn’t be put on the next delegation.</span> <span id="s461">But you had much more freedom to negotiate, and I thought we -- we achieved some things, and it -- in these -- this context, I learned very early in those days that you -- you c -- you shouldn’t have great expectations of great achievement, but step by step, you put one brick on top of the other, a-and you get some things done.</span> <span id="s462">And in those days it was easier to talk about human rights education, because it was not seen by many of the dictatorial governments as being threatening.</span> <span id="s463">What they didn’t realize is that in the long run human rights education is much more dangerous to them than some more advocacy oriented course, because if you begin to teach children about -- that they have rights, that can have an impact.</span> <span id="s464">And so we f -- I focused on that for -- for awhile.</span> <span id="s465">But that was -- I found that as a -- a fascinating experience.</span> <span id="s466">Then of course, at some point, the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO.</span> <span id="s467">I was elected to the inter-American court of human rights, and had to stop my involvement with UNESCO.</span> <span id="s468">I always thought it was a mistake that we left UNESCO, the U.S., I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: You also, I think, tried to involve parents in this [indecipherable] didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yes, we -- what we did, actually, when we came back from this first conference, we decided in connection with the book we had written that we should get American schools involved in teaching about international human rights.</span> <span id="s471">And so what we did was we organized a number of meetings with curriculum writers for high schools and grade schools and we got some fundings from various foundations.</span> <span id="s472">And th-that proved to be quite interesting, because within a few years you could see international issues like the universal declaration [indecipherable] coming into textbooks that were used in -- in American high schools.</span> <span id="s473">It’s now probably much more -- I’ve lost track, but in those days that -- that was quite unique.</span> <span id="s474">But we -- we did that for a number of years and got a lot of people interested in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: You infiltrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: We infiltrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: And then came --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Because you know, I -- I think what is -- what is so often lost to the United States, we have as a country so much to offer in this field, in terms of our experience with -- with human rights, with civil rights, and -- and with the court system over the fact that these issues are litigated in courts, that -- that they are not fought on in the streets.</span> <span id="s479">Yet, when it comes to making a contribution, on our contributing also in other parts of the world, a-and getting involved in these activities, we shy back and we -- we think that this is somehow threatening to us.</span> <span id="s480">On the contrary, we have an obligation to contribute what we know in this area.</span> <span id="s481">So I -- I’ve always felt that this was a very important job, I -- and I liked it very much, it was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: And then c -- and then came a period, late 70’s until ’91, I believe, that you called in the earlier interview, in some way -- quote now, in some ways one of the most in-interesting periods in your life, and that was your -- that you became a member, and eventually also president of the inter-American court of human rights.</span> <span id="s483">Could you say something about that particular court, and what -- what you did was -- what your involvement was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Well, I should tell you first how I got on the court, or rather it -- it’s just interesting.</span> <span id="s485">I -- at that point I was teaching at the University of Texas in Austin at their law school.</span> <span id="s486">And I -- I used to teach a seminar every year on international human rights, and one part of the seminar dealt with the inter-American system.</span> <span id="s487">And I would in every seminar say what a pity it was that the U.S. had not ratified the American convention on human rights, because it meant that an American would never sit on the inter-American court of human rights.</span> <span id="s488">And then one day I was sitting in my office on one of those sunny days in -- hot days in Texas and the phone rang, and somebody with a Latin American accent identified himself as coming from the embassy of Costa Rica, and said that he was calling to ask whether I would permit Costa Rica the honor of nominating me to the inter-American court of human rights.</span> <span id="s489">And I was sure it was one of my students playing games with me.</span> <span id="s490">So I very carefully said, “Of course, Mr. Ambassador, I’m profoundly honored, but I need to speak to my wife.”</span> <span id="s491">You know, one of those things.</span> <span id="s492">And, “Would you mind giving me your telephone number that I -- I will call you back.”</span> <span id="s493">And of course, as soon as he gave me the telephone number, I checked to see what the telephone number was for the embassy of Costa Rica, and it was really Costa Rica.</span> <span id="s494">And I -- I think I accepted the next day.</span> <span id="s495">I thought it was nice to -- to wait.</span> <span id="s496">And that’s how I ended up on the court.</span> <span id="s497">I had actually been interested in being on the commission, like -- the inter-American human rights system has a commission and a court, and on the commission, the U.S. does have a representative.</span> <span id="s498">A -- a member.</span> <span id="s499">And so I tha -- that was my hope, I never expected to be on the court.</span> <span id="s500">The great thing, and the reason I said it was such a wonderful experience, I was one of the seven first members of the court.</span> <span id="s501">We established the court.</span> <span id="s502">We held our first meeting in the bathhouse of the Costa Rican bar association.</span> <span id="s503">We had one typewriter, that’s how it started.</span> <span id="s504">And it’s now -- and then for the next -- I had two terms, and I was re-nominated by Costa Rica and by Columbia and I served for -- for 12 years on the court, and we really laid -- in those -- we had some bi -- I had some wonderful colleagues, and we laid the groundwork for a human rights tribunal which today is playing an important role.</span> <span id="s505">It’s not as significant still as the -- as the European Court of Human Rights, which is much older now, but it is doing some good, and it’s trying to -- to have an important role in -- in Latin America, particularly.</span> <span id="s506">So in that sense, to -- to be at the inception of all of this, it was a tremendous experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Did you deal -- did you deal with cases of disappearance at that time?</span> <span id="s508">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, the -- the f -- the f -- important disappearance cases, the first three came to the court when I was still president of the court.</span> <span id="s510">And it -- it was -- this was -- these were cases involving disappearances in Honduras that had taken place in -- between 1979 and ’82, in -- during that period.</span> <span id="s511">And the -- the cases carried on for a number of years, but the decision that we rendered was -- was really the f -- the first international decisions dealing with the whole issue of disappearances.</span> <span id="s512">And we awarded damages to the families of the disappeared, they were -- they were killed.</span> <span id="s513">And I had then the great satisfaction, after I was no longer on the court, of receiving the payment on behalf of the court, from the government of Honduras, the compensation payment that was still due to the victims.</span> <span id="s514">That was much later, th-that was -- took place in Washington.</span> <span id="s515">That is a -- you have a sense you’ve done something.</span> <span id="s516">And th-those were terrible days, and of course in Honduras the disappearances were much less than what had happened in Argentina for example.</span> <span id="s517">But Argentina was not part of the system yet at that time, whereas Honduras was.</span> <span id="s518">And -- and, you know, having played that role, and having had to listen to the witnesses, and we lost a number of witnesses who were killed in Honduras.</span> <span id="s519">So it was a -- a terrible experience in one way, and a [indecipherable] gratifying experience in the sense also of laying the foundation for the [indecipherable] subject, and also establishing the principle that the government has responsibilities and has to compensate the victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: At that time I believe, a disappearance sort of emerged, or the disappearances emerged as sort of the new phenomenon to some degree, but was it also -- did it also remind you of the Holocaust in some ways?</span> <span id="s521">Were there aspects that were sort of similar to --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Less so there than -- than on the truth commission, where I s-served later on.</span> <span id="s523">Of course, you know that when they describe tortures and things like this, you -- but -- but the -- the killings were not on the mass level that the things that we encountered in -- in El Salvador.</span> <span id="s524">The -- the thing that -- that stru -- has struck me always in my work in human rights is the different -- that some of the people who commit these acts have no -- no s-s -- I don’t know, i-it’s not question of conscience, but if we -- j-just to give you an example, we -- we had one man who testified as a witness, had been involved in this, and we asked, were they tortured?</span> <span id="s525">And he said, “No, they weren’t tortured,” But -- and we said, “Well you had this woman standing there for 24 hours naked in this cellar, trying to get a confession in front of men.”</span> <span id="s526">“Well, that wasn’t torture.”</span> <span id="s527">Y-You know, the different notion of what is torture, if y -- if you don’t hit somebody over the head, then it’s okay.</span> <span id="s528">It -- It -- it’s just form of interrogation.</span> <span id="s529">And the justification, how you can justify all of these acts because some notion of national security is involved.</span> <span id="s530">I-It -- it runs through, and -- and there is -- there are no national borders in that, it -- you find it every place, from -- from Germany, where you could justify murdering Jews because they were unterMenschen, they weren’t human beings, to what happened in -- in Salvador or someplace else, different ethnic groups.</span> <span id="s531">Communists, or fascists or whatever.</span> <span id="s532">In that sense there is a universality among these criminals th-that is shocking in some re -- to some extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: You just mentioned that you also worked for the UN truth commission for El Salvador, that was also almost 12 years that you were involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: No, no, that was -- we had a mandate of -- of six months.</span> <span id="s535">The -- the war in El Salvador lasted for 12 years, but we were asked after the -- the peace accords had been signed to investigate what had happened during those 12 years.</span> <span id="s536">And th-there were three of us, basically, were the members of the commission,; a former president of Columbia and a former foreign minister of Venezuela and I, with a staff.</span> <span id="s537">And basically our job was to -- to try to determine responsibility on both sides, on the guerilla side and on the government side for some of the terrible acts that happened, for example, the killing of the archbishop Romero, the killing of the Jesuits, the -- the rapes and killings of the church women.</span> <span id="s538">The El Mozote massacre, the killings by the [indecipherable] of various mayors, and so that -- that was our job.</span> <span id="s539">And there, in various contexts, the Holocaust came back.</span> <span id="s540">I -- I remember the one survivor whom we interviewed on the massacre of El Mozote, it was in the -- in the hills where they murdered -- it’s very hard to say, I would think about 800 people.</span> <span id="s541">The woman who was describing that started talking about how it happened, and I could have finished the story in terms of my own experience, what the soldiers were doing, how they were doing it.</span> <span id="s542">It was just as if I -- if I had been there.</span> <span id="s543">Similar things with, for example, the killing of the Jesuits.</span> <span id="s544">I remember -- I had just been in Auschwitz about a year earlier and had told my wife how -- we -- we came to Auschwitz, this was in May, and I said to her, you know what is most unbelieving about Birkenau where I was, that the grass is growing, it’s about two, three feet high and birds are flying.</span> <span id="s545">When I was in Auschwitz, there was not -- there was only mud, and there were no birds because of the smoke from the crematorium.</span> <span id="s546">When we were in El Salvador, in the courtyard where they had executed the Jesuit fathers, somebody pointed to a tower where supposedly there’d been ob-observers, and he said -- this was a -- a -- th-the courtyard they had planted roses.</span> <span id="s547">And they said, right over there, over the bushes, and -- but it’s now overgrown, you can’t see it.</span> <span id="s548">And it brought back Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s549">You couldn’t see what had happened in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s550">So one doesn’t lose those things in different environments, but -- and it came back in many contexts, in context of people in El Salvador.</span> <span id="s551">I’ve never heard in -- anybody in El Salvador say that they were sorry for what they did.</span> <span id="s552">They only said that it was a mistake.</span> <span id="s553">Wa -- I’ve never quite understood what that meant, that it was a mistake that if they had done it better, I suppose they could have -- and those are the things we are struggling with, we are dealing with when we are dealing with human rights violations, that we have to create in the world a sense that these are no -- not mistakes.</span> <span id="s554">These are terrible things for which people should be sorry, and they should know that they will be, that they’ll be on their conscience and they shouldn’t be doing them.</span> <span id="s555">That’ll take a -- a long time.</span> <span id="s556">But it -- it was striking to me, I’d -- I’d never thought about it until I had to interview some of these people on both sides.</span> <span id="s557">Never heard the word sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Germans [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes, never --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: [indecipherable] just hadn’t done it with the Jews, Hitler was not so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yeah, you know.</span> <span id="s562">That --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: So all of those things -- an -- and on that point what is -- what is also interesting, there is a universality among these criminals.</span> <span id="s565">That is to say, wh-when I read Solzhenitsyn’s a-about the gulag, it was no different from the camps.</span> <span id="s566">Th-There was -- there are limits to the lack of ingenuity in which human beings commit crimes.</span> <span id="s567">And -- and you see it, I think, what we saw in Rwanda, what we now saw in East Timor with -- what we saw in El Salvador, what we saw in -- the terrible things that happened in Argentina during the so-called dirty war.</span> <span id="s568">Where you -- where you have, for example, people murdering a pregnant woman and then taking the child of the woman as their own, which I -- to-to me is the most -- it’s the ultimate in -- in insanity, in criminal insanity.</span> <span id="s569">That’s the kind of work I was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So how do you -- under those circumstances, how do you keep your resolve, your belief in -- in the worthwhileness of everything.</span> <span id="s571">I mean trying to -- trying to push for policy changes, I guess, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Well, what choice do we have?</span> <span id="s573">It -- it’s really -- I mean, we either accept that this is how it has to be, or you say, we’re going to try to see whether we can improve it, whether we can prevent this from happening.</span> <span id="s574">For our children, our grandchildren, it -- it has to stop.</span> <span id="s575">And even if you know that it’s -- it -- it may not -- you may not be always successful, it’s important to do it.</span> <span id="s576">And it -- situations have improved, I mean it’s -- there are -- you know, when I -- when you see many of the young people in Germany today, things -- I -- I find the German youth to be more European than the youth of -- of many countries in Europe.</span> <span id="s577">Human rights education, democracy education had -- had a serious impact.</span> <span id="s578">I think the problems that Germany has today is that -- that education, which was done in West Germany on democracy, was not done with the East Germans when they joined.</span> <span id="s579">And they just assumed that if they watched West German television and -- and ate West German food that suddenly they would be democrat.</span> <span id="s580">And so now you have the skinheads and some of these problems.</span> <span id="s581">But I think the German experience, at least in the west, is gratifying in many ways.</span> <span id="s582">And, you know, there is hope.</span> <span id="s583">And what is happening in countries in Latin America, where you suddenly see Argentina today, for example -- even El Salvador, things have -- have improved now, they have a lot of crime and other things, but politically things, they have elections and so, you know, you -- you have reason to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: I just have a cu -- while I’m listening to you I just have couple of different kinds of questions related to that.</span> <span id="s585">You just said Latin America, did you bring -- you brought your own perspective, experience as a Holocaust survivor to this to some degree, but you also are bringing, probably, a North American perspective.</span> <span id="s586">Did -- did you ever feel that you have sort of North American perspectives in -- in your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: You know, I’ve -- I’ve -- it’s strange, I -- I’ve never se -- I’m very proud of being an American in the sense that I -- I’ve often thought it’s -- p-proud in the sense that if you -- that I had to become an American.</span> <span id="s588">Others were born into being an American, and -- and -- and I -- there’s enough about the country -- the country has been very good to me.</span> <span id="s589">I admire a great deal that has happened, that the country does and has done and that it stands for in many ways.</span> <span id="s590">There’s a lot of things that I -- that I don’t find admirable.</span> <span id="s591">But I’ve never thought of myself in any way when I go someplace, as an American in the sense of somebody who’s wrapped around the flag.</span> <span id="s592">I -- I think of myself a-as a American citizen who is asked to do a job and tries to do it in -- in the way he thinks it should be done.</span> <span id="s593">But not thinking of it that, you know -- I certainly don’t feel that I have to bring America to Latin America or anything like this.</span> <span id="s594">But I think that in some areas countries could learn a great deal from America, but I think it’s true also the other way around.</span> <span id="s595">And w-we -- we don’t have a monopoly on -- on wisdom, and -- and we sometimes think we do, an-and I -- I think that’s -- that’s bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: I guess I didn’t mean it quite so crudely, I was just thinking a strong emphasis on individual rights, for instance, tends to be a part of -- of the outlook of the -- this country, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: But a -- but I think, in my case, the -- the cr -- the commitment to individual rights is probably less influenced by America as much as by my own experience.</span> <span id="s598">I -- I’ve sort of start with the assumption that -- that people should be treated the way I want to be treated, and would like to be treated, and -- and that is universal a notion, I think, in -- that’s how you can build a whole human rights system on that basis.</span> <span id="s599">So when people come to me and say human rights are relativistic I always ask, does that mean that the people who say that want to be -- that in some countries that they really want to be killed, that they want to have their arms chopped off, that they want to have these things done to them?</span> <span id="s600">Or are they just excuses by the leaders who -- who want to violate their rights?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: What makes for a good human rights lawyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: First of all, somebody who really knows his stuff as a lawyer.</span> <span id="s603">One of the big damage that -- mu-much damage has been done to human rights advocacy by people who politicize it as lawyers.</span> <span id="s604">I mean, it’s all right if you’re a politician and you want to politicize it, but the job of a lawyer, particularly in investigating and bringing claims has to be one that is as professional and sound, professionally lawyer-like as you can be, because you -- if you’re not, you open yourself up to charges your -- you weaken your case.</span> <span id="s605">And that -- a lot of that used to happen because we didn’t have trained human rights lawyers around, so people would make big speeches and claim that they had found certain things, and then they were proved wrong and -- and they suffered in terms of prestige.</span> <span id="s606">So to my mind the most important thing is for lawyers in this business to recognize that they have to be as good lawyers in that field as if they ran in corporations, anti-trust lawyers, tax lawyers.</span> <span id="s607">So that’s -- that’s the first requirement.</span> <span id="s608">The second requirement is that you really have to have empathy.</span> <span id="s609">You have to feel that -- that this is something that is important, that this is -- this isn’t just like any other field of the law, that this is something where you -- you have to put your heart into it, and you don’t have to necessarily work as a human rights lawyer to do that, you could work for a corporation, you can be in a big law firm, and you can on the side do a lot of good, human rights work.</span> <span id="s610">But you have to believe in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So now I think we should go to family again.</span> <span id="s612">You just mentioned your wife, that you went to Auschwitz in ’92, I believe, we will talk about that too, but my first question, is that still your first --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I think it was ’91, I’m not sure, ni --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: I’m te -- I -- I’m telling you what -- what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I can’t remember now, I’ll have to ask her.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Okay, well let’s just stick with your wife.</span> <span id="s617">Is that th-the first wife you talked about, or is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No, this is my second wife.</span> <span id="s619">We -- we married in 1983.</span> <span id="s620">I -- I met her in -- in Costa Rica.</span> <span id="s621">She is originally -- she was born in Peru of a British father and a Peruvian mother, grown -- grew -- grew up speaking English and Spanish.</span> <span id="s622">Went to school in England, was sent to school in England very -- very young.</span> <span id="s623">And then left Peru, a -- she -- she had two small children, left Peru, was divorced and in Peru -- left Peru and then lived in Costa Rica because Peru was under a military regime at the time.</span> <span id="s624">And she went to Costa Rica and lived there for eight years when we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: So what did she like -- what -- what di -- that attracted you to her?</span> <span id="s627">Or to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: An unbelievably intelligent human being with a great sense of humor tha -- a person who has the tremendous ability to make me feel less important than I’ve -- want to feel.</span> <span id="s629">Who is extremely -- extremely warm, and loving and who -- who has the same, in a sense, background as I do, that you can put her in any environment and she feels at home.</span> <span id="s630">She came to the United States and within no time she -- you’d think she’d lived there all her life.</span> <span id="s631">What else could I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Well, that’s good enough for the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Don’t tell her though.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Yeah, I won’t, I won’t.</span> <span id="s635">Let’s talk about your children.</span> <span id="s636">Now, when they were young, did you -- did you talk much about where you came from?</span> <span id="s637">Were they interested, or did that come about at a later --</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: We have great disagreement ama -- about that in my family.</span> <span id="s639">My kids will say to me sometimes, why didn’t you tell us that?</span> <span id="s640">And I will say, you guys were never interested in hearing anything about it.</span> <span id="s641">Now, I don’t know who’s right, but I -- I thought that -- that I tried to tell them, and we speculated, my wife and I about it.</span> <span id="s642">We -- we do every so often now, really, and her sense is that the kids thought it was so painful that they didn’t want to -- to hear about it.</span> <span id="s643">And that’s why they didn’t ask, and I took that to mean that they were not interested, and that they were, in fact, interested.</span> <span id="s644">And she has some of that be -- you know, of talking with them.</span> <span id="s645">But it’s quite clear that they know much less about my background still, than they really should, and I am afraid.</span> <span id="s646">What worries me in many ways is that when I am gone they suddenly realize there was a chance to find out a lot of things, and we’ve never really -- a-and maybe it’s -- the dynamics of family life are such that you just don’t have time, and you don’t want -- it’s -- you have family reunion, you don’t want to talk about all of those things.</span> <span id="s647">Although, what is interesting now is that my youngest son has begun to be very -- now that he has his first child, very interested in family roots and backgrounds.</span> <span id="s648">And has asked my uncle who’s -- who is in his late 80’s now, to put together an album and -- and has asked me to -- to do that.</span> <span id="s649">So there -- there is interest, but it’s -- it’s sort of interest on the run, it’s not -- I had wanted to take my children to the Holocaust Museum, and I realized I could not do it.</span> <span id="s650">I -- I wouldn’t be able to last.</span> <span id="s651">I had been asked by Mary Magrory to take her on a tour, and when -- before the o -- before it opened, and I declined to do that, I was afraid to do it.</span> <span id="s652">I only once went through the Holocaust Museum, I was always afraid to do it.</span> <span id="s653">And I was sort of forced to do it when the president of Honduras came to Washington, and -- who had been a friend of mine, and he was -- he had been on the court with me in the first few years.</span> <span id="s654">And he -- he went -- came on a state visit to Washington and asked that I would be the one to accompany him.</span> <span id="s655">What he didn’t realize was that I’d never gone through, that I didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s656">And so I asked the -- the person at the Holocaust Museum to arrange for the tour.</span> <span id="s657">He knew that I -- my reluctance.</span> <span id="s658">And we went -- fortunately, it was a relatively brief tour, and -- and it was a nif -- I had no pr-problem doing it.</span> <span id="s659">But at the end he said to the -- he said, “Mr. President, you know, Professor Buergenthal had never done this before.”</span> <span id="s660">And -- and I said, “I couldn’t do it with my children, I’d break down.”</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: It is -- it is interesting because you -- I’m jumping a few years ahead now, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: I’m sorry yo -- I should tell you, beca -- I’m very tired today, but anyway, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s664">W-Would you like to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: No, no, no, I’m just -- I didn’t sleep last night, I -- I don’t know why, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: I didn’t either.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: No, no, so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So we’re both tired, but I’m still --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: But no, keep going.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: [indecipherable] but -- but let me -- let me know when --</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, no, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: -- if you’re almost -- just -- there are just a few things because you said roots were -- well, I want to ask you about the -- the subject a little bit later, but -- a little bit later, not much.</span> <span id="s673">But you did say roots, and I know that you and your wife decided at one point to -- to go back to your roots, and investigate a little bit.</span> <span id="s674">Could you say something about when that was, and what you actually did?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes, I think that was in 1992 or ’91, I’m not sure, we’ll have to ask her.</span> <span id="s676">We -- we decided to go to my birthplace, which is in Slovakia in ot -- in a little resort town called Lubochnia.</span> <span id="s677">And we decided to go to -- to Auschwitz, and to Kielce where I was in -- in the ghetto, and some other towns where I had been during the war.</span> <span id="s678">Lubochnia, where I was born, m-my father came there, and he and a friend of his brother bought a hotel there, believing that Hitler wouldn’t last more than a few years, and so they would be close by, and I -- I was born there, but -- and I left there when I was four years old.</span> <span id="s679">So going back to this little place in the mountains in Slovakia, in the lower Tatra mountains wa-was sort of a surrealistic experience.</span> <span id="s680">I knew I was born there, but I had no connection to it.</span> <span id="s681">There was nobody there that lived there that -- that knew my family.</span> <span id="s682">My father had been there for a relatively short time, from 1933 until ’38.</span> <span id="s683">We couldn’t find the hotel, because it -- th -- we think we found the hotel, but it looked very different from the picture we had.</span> <span id="s684">And so i-it was a strange experience.</span> <span id="s685">I took a picture of myself standing under the sign that said, Lubochnia as you entered the town, but there was no -- i-it -- it’s really a strange experience, I -- I never thought that it would be that strange an experience, because you -- this is where one was born, these are one’s roots, but they are not really roots, they’re just like somebody cut the -- the roots and left them in the ground, but there is no -- no connection at all.</span> <span id="s686">Auschwitz turned out to be easier than I expected.</span> <span id="s687">I was at that point thinking seriously, and I was doing some writing on the subject.</span> <span id="s688">And we -- we went to Auschwitz debating whether I should go or not because of memories that would be destroyed in some ways by seeing it now from what I had envisage.</span> <span id="s689">And we came in -- we went first to Auschwitz І, which was really not the camp where I was, but I was in -- in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s690">And -- and I was very afraid of the impact it would have on me.</span> <span id="s691">And then my wife saw a sign that said archives, and she said, “Why don’t you go in and introduce yourself?”</span> <span id="s692">And I said, “No, I don’t want t -- I want to be a tourist, ye -- I just want to go through.”</span> <span id="s693">And she insisted, and when she insists, I usually end up doing what she wants me to do.</span> <span id="s694">So I went in and I introduced myself, and they got very excited because they were just working on a project relating to children in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s695">So they wanted to know where I had been.</span> <span id="s696">I didn’t know exactly when I arrived in Auschwitz, and I thought by looking at where I came from and my name, that they would have it.</span> <span id="s697">And they said by the time I arrived, it -- they no longer had names, but what was my number?</span> <span id="s698">And by reference to my number they pinpointed exactly when I had gotten to Auschwitz, the date, the number of people that were on my transport, and suddenly my stay in Auschwitz had become an academic exercise, and was you know -- you know, we were discussing, the director came and wanted to know, you know, where -- they had a big map and they wanted me to find where I had been in different camps and -- in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s699">And then they actually put a -- gave us a guide, and we -- we -- we did the -- did the trip together.</span> <span id="s700">But what was so -- first of all, of course, ous -- Birkenau looks very different now than it was, apart from the fact, you know, the trees and the grass that I mentioned.</span> <span id="s701">Most of barracks are not there any more.</span> <span id="s702">You just have a few examples, and I -- I had pointed out to my wife that I remembered we used to go in to the latrine, which was the only warm place in all of Auschwitz, to warm ourselves, and that they would chase us out after five minutes.</span> <span id="s703">Nobody could stay there, and I tried to describe it to her, and there it was, th-there was the barrack on -- as I’d remembered, and the mud.</span> <span id="s704">That, you know, was striking.</span> <span id="s705">We went to -- to a place in Birkenau when -- where we came in, the -- the sauna where we -- and I remember saying -- the -- the fellow said, this is the entrance.</span> <span id="s706">And I said to him no -- I said to my wife, this isn’t the entrance, I came in through an entrance that had a pool, where you had to -- disinfecting pool, and it was quite deep and you had to go in -- and he said, “No, no, this was the entrance.”</span> <span id="s707">And we walked around, and there is another -- there is a pool, and there is a door that was blocked off, and that was where I’d entered.</span> <span id="s708">He said, “Oh yes, this is the door.”</span> <span id="s709">And of course it wasn’t deep at all.</span> <span id="s710">It was maybe 10 centimeters pool.</span> <span id="s711">But to me as a child, you know, I was 10 years old -- not even 10 years old, it seemed like a very deep -- deep pool.</span> <span id="s712">I wi -- I had the same experience in the ghetto in Kielce.</span> <span id="s713">What my wife found so surprising was, I am very bad on directions.</span> <span id="s714">I -- I can -- i -- by -- in my family if I say turn left, all the kids say turn right.</span> <span id="s715">So, you know, nobody ever listens to me when I say how you find something.</span> <span id="s716">We drive into Kielce, this town in Poland, and my wife says, “Well what now?</span> <span id="s717">Should we ask somebody where the ghetto was?”</span> <span id="s718">And I said, “No, just drive down,” -- [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: So your wife was -- was saying what -- what now.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Right.</span> <span id="s721">And we end up a block across where the ghetto was.</span> <span id="s722">And on the way, actually driving into Kielce, I suddenly remembered the name of the camp commandant, and a number of other names.</span> <span id="s723">And then we f -- I find the street -- the house where I was in the ghetto, where we stayed.</span> <span id="s724">And I’d remembered -- I kept saying to -- to Peggy, this is a very -- it was a very tall building, and if -- we got in and it was a three story, small three story apartment house, with -- I remembered the courtyard.</span> <span id="s725">It looked just as bad now as it looked then, it -- it wasn’t in any better shape.</span> <span id="s726">What was disheartening to me was that this was a ghetto in which more then 20,000 Jews had been -- had been shipped to Treblinka from there, including my grandparents.</span> <span id="s727">There wasn’t one monument to indicate where the ghetto was.</span> <span id="s728">Disgraceful, really.</span> <span id="s729">It’s really part of the history of Kielce and I -- I went to the museum then, to -- to try to find something about the ghetto and they did say, oh yes, we had an exhibit here not long ago.</span> <span id="s730">We have this little book that was still prepared in communist days.</span> <span id="s731">But nothing that shows this is where there was population that has been killed.</span> <span id="s732">We -- there were only about five hundred that survived the -- the ghetto of Kielce.</span> <span id="s733">That’s disheartening, you know.</span> <span id="s734">It -- it’s -- it’s disheartening because it shows at -- it’s a continuing insult to -- it -- it sort of adds insult to injury when -- when that is -- when there is no attempt to remember what happened here.</span> <span id="s735">It’s as if we obliterated all cemeteries.</span> <span id="s736">Just think what that would mean to societies, suddenly say there are no cemeteries.</span> <span id="s737">And thi -- this is what I felt in -- in that ti -- I couldn't wait to get out of there.</span> <span id="s738">I -- I found it harder to take than -- than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s739">I should tell you that I went back to Auschwitz, because I mentioned that I was actually called in right after an -- a sec -- my second visit to Auschwitz that I was going to be sitting on this -- or that I was nominated by the U.S., and that was because a -- a British journalist and -- who decided that he wanted to write a book about me insisted that I go to Auschwitz on the -- to coincide with the date of the Death March out of Auschwitz, on which I was.</span> <span id="s740">And th-that was -- it was easier when my wife and I went, because it was summer and it was easier to take.</span> <span id="s741">When we were there on the 20th of January, an -- 21st -- 20th of January of -- of nin -- of 2000, it was just as it was -- as I remembered it, in terms of the cold, the road was all ice and all I could think about was, how did I ever survive this?</span> <span id="s742">Because I was dressed in the heaviest jacket with sweaters, with hat, and I was freezing, and I was there as a child with a little blanket and thin prison uniform.</span> <span id="s743">And -- and I made it.</span> <span id="s744">It -- it’s hard to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Is it -- is it harder, now that you get older, to remember, to deal with it?</span> <span id="s746">Is it less easy to push things away a little bit, with work, or whatever?</span> <span id="s747">Do -- are you becoming more -- more sensitive?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s749">I-It’s strange, because in many ways, memories fade.</span> <span id="s750">And I -- I remember going back -- I’d -- I’d written this article about the Death March in 1956, when it was still very clear in my mind, because that was 1945, the Death March.</span> <span id="s751">And I had all of the details.</span> <span id="s752">I reread it because I -- I -- there were things that I hadn’t remembered any more.</span> <span id="s753">At the same time the emotional impact today is -- is much greater.</span> <span id="s754">I also think we get softer in our old age, in terms of [indecipherable] experience, it’s -- but y-you know what is interesting is that while the memories of details fade, what doesn’t fade is the -- the memory of the episode as a -- as a whole.</span> <span id="s755">And I wish I could -- I -- I could have the poet’s soul to write about it, to capture that, because I -- I think -- I’m not sure that one -- that that is coming through in the literature.</span> <span id="s756">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s757">As a matter of fact, I haven’t read any books about the camp, I can’t.</span> <span id="s758">I can’t go to movies that show it, it’s -- I never could.</span> <span id="s759">So -- but I think mor -- I think I have a harder time today facing up to it in many ways, than I did when I was younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: And now --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: It’s old age, you see, when you -- when you see veterans breaking down.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: In that context let’s go back to the o -- in terms of time ahead, but in terms of what we talked about, back to the -- your work with the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s763">In ’96, I believe, you became a member of the council?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And from ’97 to ’99 -- I tried to do my homework a little bit, you were a -- a member of the Committee on Conscience?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: I chaired the -- the committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Y-You chaired -- you were the chairman, yes.</span> <span id="s768">The -- the significance of the museum, speak to that a little bit, and the kind of work you did there.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: First of all, I was a member of an advisory group originally that was involved when President Carter established the -- the Holocaust Commission, he also established an advisory group to the commission, and I was member of that.</span> <span id="s770">And the issue at that point was debated whether to have a Holocaust Museum in Washington or not.</span> <span id="s771">And I thought it was a mistake to have it in Washington.</span> <span id="s772">Again, I thought it should be in Germany and -- and not in Washington.</span> <span id="s773">Since then I’ve come to the conclusion I’ve been wrong.</span> <span id="s774">Not that it shouldn’t -- that there shouldn’t be one in Germany, but they -- the museum has been a tremen -- has had an tremendous educational impact on people in the United States, in terms of educating them to what happened.</span> <span id="s775">When I would go to meetings at the museum to -- to -- you know, we had council meetings and committee meetings, it was always impressive to see the thousands of kids lining up to go to the museum.</span> <span id="s776">And the hush that fell over them when they -- when they went in.</span> <span id="s777">So -- and -- and I think in -- in five years there were more than eight million people that had come to the museum.</span> <span id="s778">So I think it’s had a tremendous impact.</span> <span id="s779">That Committee on Conscience was something that was very close to my heart, because I feel very strongly that the museum shouldn’t be just a -- a cemetery.</span> <span id="s780">The museum has to be a living organism that tries to make sure that these things don’t happen again.</span> <span id="s781">And that means also, speaking out to -- to where other crimes against humanity and genocide is being committed.</span> <span id="s782">And we have an obligation as survivors, and we owe it to the people who died to make sure that these things don’t happen in other places.</span> <span id="s783">And so -- and that was really the function of the Committee on Conscience, and I felt that I -- if -- if -- if that’s not what the Holocaust Museum was doing, then I didn’t want to be connected with it, because I had other things to do.</span> <span id="s784">But the establishment of the committee -- and it took a long time, they -- there were internal squabbles which I wasn’t involved in, to establish it.</span> <span id="s785">But once it was established, I found that was really worthwhile, and ith -- and very important.</span> <span id="s786">And I’m glad I -- I of course had to resign from the Committee on Conscience because it speaks out on issues today, and on this court I -- I cannot be involved in anything.</span> <span id="s787">But I think it’s very -- it’s a very important role, very important what is happening there.</span> <span id="s788">Was something else I was going to mention to you.</span> <span id="s789">It is -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Maybe it’ll come back to you.</span> <span id="s791">We are kind of winding down, but of course I always have a couple of additional questions that -- you just said, I have other things to do.</span> <span id="s792">Now, over the last eight years at least, you had a lot of things to do.</span> <span id="s793">You were on separate commissions and I’m not sure we have to mention them necessarily, but if you think about those last six to eight years, what do they mean in the context of your overall work?</span> <span id="s794">Is there anything in particular that you would like to say because something has come to a conclusion in the way you -- in your philosophy of international rights, or -- or human rights, that you have taken a new direction, or just something, anything that comes to mind that you might want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No, what comes to mind, less dramatic, is the fact that it -- there seems to be some sort of poetry -- not poetic justice, but a certain justice that has poetic, or non-legal aspect to it.</span> <span id="s796">And that is that somebody with my background should be involved in these things.</span> <span id="s797">That I should be on the Truth Commission for El Salvador, that I should be on the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, that I should sit on the UN Human Rights Committee.</span> <span id="s798">That -- in a sense wh-what is impressive about it is not my career in that those things are often happenstance and anything else.</span> <span id="s799">But what is significant about it that it should give faith to people who believe -- who do -- people who are cynical a-about what can be done.</span> <span id="s800">The fact that a survivor of these things can still today have a role in trying to prevent some of these things from happening.</span> <span id="s801">That, to me, has always been the sort of significant aspect of -- of my activities.</span> <span id="s802">I would sit there and sometimes say gee, this is really, you know -- why was I granted this privilege?</span> <span id="s803">That -- that, to me, has been the -- the sort of most significant aspect.</span> <span id="s804">This is an -- an example of the fact that one can overcome si -- n-not per -- I personally, but that we can overcome some of these murderous things that have happened, and still be able to work for a better world.</span> <span id="s805">And -- and the fact that I could serve on these things indicates that there is reason to be optimistic about things.</span> <span id="s806">I -- I spoke once in -- in Germany, I think, in connection when I -- when I got the honorary degree, and I said I -- I thought -- it’s so wonderful when you think that when you go down the Rhine and when you remember that the Rhine was reinforced on both sides between France and Germany with cannons and today you don’t even need a passport.</span> <span id="s807">There’s tremendous things that have happened, that should give us a sense of optimism.</span> <span id="s808">Yet, you know, the cynics keep saying nothing is changing.</span> <span id="s809">Lots of terrible things happening, but then, a lot of good things have been happening and that -- that should inspire people to -- to want to do things.</span> <span id="s810">In my current position I -- I can no longer be an advocate, I -- I have to sit on my hands, try to apply the law.</span> <span id="s811">And that in itself is -- is a good discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: I have to -- I should always --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Oh, you know what I wanted to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Yeah, yeah, please.</span> <span id="s815">We -- we still have a little time left on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: You may want to throw it out, but it -- but it’s moved me, the other day.</span> <span id="s817">I got a telephone call the other day from a friend of mine who is a agent for authors in Switzerland, I met her when I -- you know, I was doing -- I was serving on -- running this tribunal for dormant accounts in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s818">And she had been the person who represented Wilkomirski, the man who was accused of -- of having lied.</span> <span id="s819">And she was in contact with the person in Israel who has collected all information about children, as -- in -- during the war.</span> <span id="s820">And they -- as they were talking, they were talking about somebody else, she said, “You know, I met somebody by the name of Tom Buergenthal.</span> <span id="s821">Do you have anything on him?”</span> <span id="s822">And I think she probably thought, you know, maybe my story is -- is also fake.</span> <span id="s823">So this woman says to her, “If I have something, I’ll call you back in five minutes, because I have my files here.”</span> <span id="s824">And she calls her back -- this is my friend in Switzerland telling me this.</span> <span id="s825">She calls her back and she says, “Yes, I can tell you all about him.</span> <span id="s826">I’ve got complete s-story from the orphanage in Poland where he was.</span> <span id="s827">And I -- you know, and here is the story in his own words a-as he told it when he was interviewed at the orphanage in 1946 -- ’45 - ’46.”</span> <span id="s828">So she gives me the telephone number of the woman, and I get in touch with her, and she sends me some of this material, which is th-the -- all the documents from the orphanage were turned over to the archi -- Jewish archives in -- in Poland, and she got it from there, including a list of children, which was the way I found my mother, which is -- but on it, orphans, and they are asking people in Israel who wants to adopt the children, and I’m on that list.</span> <span id="s829">S -- and this is -- I -- and things that happened are unbelievable.</span> <span id="s830">I was sitting in Zurich, doing the work of the Holocaust bank accounts, when suddenly, click on my computer, there is a email that says, I knew your father.</span> <span id="s831">A man in Australia, 87 or 88 years old, who was with us -- with my mother and father in the ghetto of Kielce, in -- in Auschwitz, and who saw my name in the Jerusalem Post, connection with an article that was written, and remembered me as a -- as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: That’s remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: And -- and the -- and not long ago, a -- an email from Israel saying, is it you?</span> <span id="s834">And it was an American woman who had gone to Israel, who received me in Czechoslovakia, when I was smuggled out of Poland, to be reunited with my mother.</span> <span id="s835">She was the person who took me into -- took charge of me in Prague to ship me to the American zone in Germany, to the British zone.</span> <span id="s836">And she’s in her 80’s and she said, “When I saw that picture of you, it was you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Do you remember her name, by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes, I -- her name is Corin, let’s see, what’s her first name.</span> <span id="s839">I have it on the -- on the computer.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Okay, I would like to stop here, tape two, follow up interview with Judge Buergenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">End of Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s843">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
