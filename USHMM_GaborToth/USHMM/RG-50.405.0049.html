I [found out] he['d died] not in 1965, but maybe five or six years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">My grandmother took care of me.</span> <span id="s60">She got a pension so she didn't work.</span> <span id="s61">My mother told me when she graduated from the institute and started her working life, she was a Komsomol leader because, you know, the people of her generation and the people of my generation, we really believed in Communism.</span> <span id="s62">Because we were grown on the Communist ideas and really believed them!</span> <span id="s63">She decided for herself that she had to enter the Communist party.</span> <span id="s64">And so, it was a story!</span></p> <p><span id="s65">She was the Komsomol leader of such a big institute, everybody knew her.</span> <span id="s66">She decided to enter the Communist party and she was given two recommendations from the Communists.</span> <span id="s67">It was the habit - who are known also as good Communists - one of them was Jewish.</span> <span id="s68">So at the Party meeting when she was introduced as a Communist for all the institute, and they were told that she's going to be a new young Communist, that she's a Komsomol person and had to be in the Communist party.</span> <span id="s69">So she got refused.</span> <span id="s70">Only because she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s71">She was so upset.</span> <span id="s72">She told me this story several times.</span> <span id="s73">She couldn't understand, couldn't believe - (So she carried this around with her the rest of her life?)</span> <span id="s74">No!</span> <span id="s75">She remembers it, but she said thanks to God they didn't [let her in] because the events which happened after all, the rise of anti-semitism and everything that happened, the crash of all the system, she understood who were Communists in real life who were not true people.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">I don't want to use bad words, but I can't say two good words about them.</span> <span id="s77">They were dishonest people.</span> <span id="s78">The most dishonest people were Communists.</span> <span id="s79">[She had finished with this.]</span> <span id="s80">She understood it maybe at once, maybe a year later, but she told me about it when I became a teenager because she didn't want to tell me about everything when I was very little, because I wouldn't understand exactly, but she wanted me to understand exactly about all of this, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">(Jewish holidays, etc.) The only Jewish holiday which we celebrated was Passover because I never saw in the Soviet Union a Jewish wedding, Jewish funeral, nothing, never, because it was so difficult to see.</span> <span id="s82">People were very afraid.</span> <span id="s83">I only know about when maybe two or three men were imprisoned when they tried to teach other young people Hebrew.</span> <span id="s84">It was in the early 1970s.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">(school) We had a beautiful life when we were children.</span> <span id="s86">First of all, a lot of Jewish people lived in central Moscow.</span> <span id="s87">In these years there wasn't [a lot of] anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s88">The [rise] came... probably it started in 1967-68.</span> <span id="s89">It was the year after they called it "Israeli Aggression".</span> <span id="s90">We didn't know what it is, what it means.</span> <span id="s91">We thought they told us the truth.</span> <span id="s92">Some years later we read that it's not true, of course.</span> <span id="s93">But it was a shock.</span> <span id="s94">When they told that these aggressors had occupied Arabic countries.</span> <span id="s95">Now I couldn't tell for sure what did they tell exactly, but it was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s96">It was very difficult for Jews because you can hear on every corner "you, Jewish nose, you Jewish face".</span> <span id="s97">On TV, in the newspapers, propaganda.</span> <span id="s98">Probably 100 times a day they told about it, they didn't stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">My mother [was discriminated against] because she was wanting to get a promotion.</span> <span id="s100">She didn't get it.</span> <span id="s101">No one told her it's because she's a Jew, but it was very clear.</span> <span id="s102">Not only [was she not promoted], but several people, only Jews [weren't promoted].</span></p> <p><span id="s103">(How did you feel?)</span> <span id="s104">You know, first of all, I have to say that not only me, but a lot of my friends, we hadn't an opportunity to read something about Israel, but we loved Israel!</span> <span id="s105">Even then.</span> <span id="s106">I never thought [badly of Israel].</span> <span id="s107">The only thing I didn't believe but I can't tell something for the defence of Israel, because I wasn't familiar with the policy.</span> <span id="s108">I didn't blame Israel or the Arabic countries.</span> <span id="s109">I was on the side of Israel, but I knew nothing about - so, I know a lot of Jewish people who blamed Israel, the aggressor, and so on.</span> <span id="s110">I was sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s111">I was very much surprised.</span> <span id="s112">I couldn't discuss this subject in school or on the street.</span> <span id="s113">Only with my friends.</span> <span id="s114">The only thing my mother said to me was, "I do not think it is true.</span> <span id="s115">I don't know exactly what happened, but I do not think it is true.</span> <span id="s116">But, do not speak about it at school with the other girls and boys.</span> <span id="s117">Keep silent about it."</span> <span id="s118">My friends were only Jewish.</span> <span id="s119">Only Jewish.</span> <span id="s120">I didn't separate, but I started at this school, at the very center of Moscow.</span> <span id="s121">In the [rounding] of the houses where the people with high social level lived, I started with them, with the students of such parents, whose parents were artists, in science, some in government, a lot in the military.</span> <span id="s122">To tell the truth, they were very intelligent people, their parents and the students in the school.</span> <span id="s123">And I never (me and my Jewish friends) we never felt, you know, that we are, - nobody showed by the fingers that you're a Jew.</span> <span id="s124">Now it's different.</span> <span id="s125">A lot of teachers were Jewish.</span> <span id="s126">In Moscow because all over the country, in Russia, if you go 30 miles south of Moscow, you'll never find, not never, you'd have a hard time finding Jewish families in Russia.</span> <span id="s127">Near Moscow and deep Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">But in the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia, you'll find a lot of Jewish people, because this is where they were allowed to live under czarist Russia.</span> <span id="s129">They stayed.</span> <span id="s130">They didn't move.</span> <span id="s131">Some of them moved to Moscow after the revolution, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">(When did you want to be a journalist?)</span> <span id="s133">I didn't decide that I wanted to be a journalist when I graduated from high school in 1970.</span> <span id="s134">For three years I tried to enter the Institute of Foreign Languages, but forget about it.</span> <span id="s135">They didn't explain why.</span> <span id="s136">I had to pass four exams - English - To enter this institute [there are] four exams.</span> <span id="s137">I needed to pass the exams with two Bs and two As.</span> <span id="s138">They couldn't give me a B when I passed the English exam because after school my English was excellent, you know, very good -- pronunciation, grammar, everything.</span> <span id="s139">So then it was history of the USSR, Russian language-- also excellent, and compositions.</span> <span id="s140">And they gave me a not very good grade for Soviet history.</span> <span id="s141">They said I wasn't well-prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">I hadn't the opportunity to discuss because you're a professor and I'm going to be a student.</span> <span id="s143">She said, you're not well-prepared.</span> <span id="s144">I can't give you a B. I have to put C. I have to tell them, please ask me other questions, questions no one can answer.</span> <span id="s145">Three years I tried with success of zero.</span> <span id="s146">I worked at school, some secretarial work, and then I was sick and tired of this and my mother says I have to try something else because it's impossible to be without a profession.</span> <span id="s147">I have a "humanities" kind of mind.</span> <span id="s148">I'm not good with technical science stuff.</span> <span id="s149">So I start to look for what I can enter.</span> <span id="s150">I found nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">So my mother suggested that I go to some kind of college connected with proofreading.</span> <span id="s152">My Russian language was very good and you have to have this.</span> <span id="s153">So I entered this college without any difficulty because it's not the high level of education, just the middle level.</span> <span id="s154">And they don't think about anti-semitism at this level.</span> <span id="s155">It's difficult and strange to understand, but they just didn't want Soviet Jews to get the high education.</span> <span id="s156">They allowed us to have the middle education, not the high.</span> <span id="s157">After this I started to work as a proofreader.</span> <span id="s158">After this I decided to get into the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">(What did you really want to do?)</span> <span id="s160">I wanted to be an interpreter, to translate technical articles, to translate, to help in translation with groups of foreign tourists.</span> <span id="s161">(Would it have given you more opportunities had you gotten into the Foreign Language Institute?)</span> <span id="s162">Yes, because to graduate from this institute, it was very prestigious.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">(Editing a journal) It was not very big.</span> <span id="s164">It was a trade journal in hydroelectric power stations and nuclear stations.</span> <span id="s165">Like Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s166">It was like our child, the institute where I worked.</span> <span id="s167">The journal was part of this institute.</span> <span id="s168">The project, first of all, it was all over the Soviet Union, project institute of the power stations building.</span> <span id="s169">It was a little scientific part of this institute.</span> <span id="s170">They like to call big institutes in the USSR ["All-Union"], a national publication.</span> <span id="s171">We published twice a month, and abroad bi-monthly.</span> <span id="s172">Because this institute did projects in the so-called third world.</span> <span id="s173">It wasn't a real subscription because you could buy it at the stores.</span> <span id="s174">But it's usual, the main readers of this journal weren't all people, the narrow specialists.</span> <span id="s175">A circulation of maybe 2,000, but I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">(the workplace) There was some socializing with some of [my co-workers].</span> <span id="s177">They were Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s178">(How did you know this?)</span> <span id="s179">First of all, as usual, it was on the faces, then the last name, and if I saw a person for the first time and I saw that his or her face was Jewish and their last name is Jewish, I usually tried to ask this person some simple questions.</span> <span id="s180">After answering those questions I would decide for sure if I am right or if I am not, because you can see a person with a real Jewish face and name but he's not Jewish.</span> <span id="s181">It could be a mistake, but... [laughter] The questions, not a trick question, but a roundabout question.</span> <span id="s182">Maybe I was wrong when I told you I will ask questions.</span> <span id="s183">Sometimes I'll start to talk about something that connects only to Jewish life, and if they answer in the way I would like to hear, [then I know].</span></p> <p><span id="s184">(Camaraderie among Jews at work?)</span> <span id="s185">Well, as you know, we did our own thing, but if somebody asks for help, I'll do it with pleasure, not only for Jews, but anyone.</span> <span id="s186">A lot of people tried to cooperate, but there were some who didn't want to.</span> <span id="s187">It depends on the person.</span> <span id="s188">To rise you needed to be a member of the Communist party and not Jewish.</span> <span id="s189">I did have opportunity, but it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s190">I worked there twelve years.</span> <span id="s191">I started working there when I was in proofreading college.</span> <span id="s192">To tell the truth, I had an unusual working life because I was promoted several times.</span> <span id="s193">But it was the only case.</span> <span id="s194">I don't know why but it's true.</span> <span id="s195">For other Jews, it was difficult, very difficult for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">(What were your job titles?)</span> <span id="s197">Because we were part of the Institute, we had the same job names as the engineers had, like project leader, senior engineer, and so on.</span> <span id="s198">We hadn't [ ] working names.</span> <span id="s199">When I began as a proofreader I wasn't a proofreader, - I was an entry level engineer.</span> <span id="s200">Then I became an engineer, then I became a senior engineer.</span> <span id="s201">Then my last description was chief senior engineer.</span> <span id="s202">I did editing.</span> <span id="s203">But I was promoted in the job title and in money.</span> <span id="s204">But the kind of work remained absolutely the same.</span> <span id="s205">It was interesting [work] for me.</span> <span id="s206">I don't know how it is in America, but in the Soviet Union a lot of people work in the technical fields.</span> <span id="s207">They're bright engineers, but they can't express their thoughts in a good literary way.</span> <span id="s208">They can write the articles, but it's so difficult to read -
