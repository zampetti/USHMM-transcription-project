And did you see a change in the government taking place at that time when you were a young person?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A. Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s35">It was nineteen hundred and eighteen when I was seven years old when the so-called revolution came on the -- Czechoslovakia it was founded.</span> <span id="s36">It was just as a boy running with other boys there and suddenly saw there was starting the shooting.</span> <span id="s37">And we saw people falling and we run.</span> <span id="s38">We thought we could get away not to be hit by bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q.

Now, as you were going to school, what trade did you take up and what type of work did you become engaged in when you got out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A. Well, after high school I was at textile school, and then I was employed as supervisor in a silk factory, Silvat A.G. (phoenetic) in Trutmerinstrebau (phoenetic), and I had under my supervision actually six hundred employees.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s53">Would you please tell us what was the condition like in that part of Czechoslovakia economically?</span> <span id="s54">How did the people -- how did they react to the employment picture and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A.</span> <span id="s56">It was democracy, wasn't bad, but we felt because living in the German part of the country and being Germans, for instance, the first prominence was French or Bohemian language and German language, you know.</span> <span id="s57">So we felt a little bit sidetrack of a second class.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s59">And were you ever in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A. Yeah, 1932 I was recruited into the army compulsory, you know, if you were fit.</span> <span id="s61">And then I serve from 1932 to the Spring of 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q. And was that in the Czechoslovakian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A. Was in the Czechoslovakian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q. Well, when was it then that you and your parents became Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A.</span> <span id="s66">An uncle of mine, he was nine years in concentration camp, in several concentration camps, and he actually was a stout Catholic.</span> <span id="s67">And then he -- and then one book was given to him probably by one of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s68">He read it and visited my mother, which is actually his sister.</span> <span id="s69">And he said, "According to this book what I read, we don't have the truth.</span> <span id="s70">So I will write to Prague and will ask one of those men to come to my place and explain it to me."</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q. Now, what was that year that you're speaking of?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A. 1933.</span> <span id="s73">It could have been a little bit 13 earlier, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q. Uh-huh (indicates affirmatively).</span> <span id="s75">So he was the first one in your family who became --</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A. Ja; ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s78">So then when did you become one of Jehovah's Witnesses, since you were in the army?</span> <span id="s79">Evidently you weren't one then.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A.</span> <span id="s81">It was in the Spring of 1934.</span> <span id="s82">I was released from the army.</span> <span id="s83">And then they invited me and I saw the Photograma of Creation, beautiful slides.</span> <span id="s84">And it shows actually a beautiful future according to God's purpose that our whole Earth will become a paradise.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q. Now, who was that sponsored by, the Photograma of Creation?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A.</span> <span id="s87">It was sponsored by the Watch Tower Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s89">So then when did you become then one of Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A. Shortly after this drama I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s91">I went to one of their first meetings.</span> <span id="s92">And a brother who came from Prague explained this and then he would ask who would go on Sunday service.</span> <span id="s93">I put my head down and said, "I cannot do it this time."</span> <span id="s94">But at the second meeting I said, "I don't get away this time anymore," so I volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q. Uh-huh (indicates affirmatively).</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A.</span> <span id="s97">The brother who was in charge of the territory, he said, "Ja, you start on this side and I go the other way around until we meet."</span> <span id="s98">And we met after four hours.</span> <span id="s99">Can you feel the embarrassment knowing so little about the Bible being the second time at a meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s101">Now, what do you mean by service?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A. I mean house-to-house service, you know, that actually Jesus instituted or introduced.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s104">So then that's when you became one</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A. Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q. I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A. And shortly after that I put an application in for pioneering and then I was called not long after that to Bethel service because one of the German brothers couldn't stay, remain anymore in Czechoslovakia so he got to go back.</span> <span id="s108">And there was a need for one looking after the ship, shipping department.</span> <span id="s109">So I volunteered and I was accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q. Now, that was what you're referring to, the Bethel, is that the branch over there in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A.</span> <span id="s112">That was the branch office, I would say, an outlet of the headquarters in Boklenia (phonetic).</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q. And that was located?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A.</span> <span id="s115">That was located in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q. And what type of work did you do at that branch headquarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A.</span> <span id="s118">At the branch I did -- I was in charge of the shipping department.</span> <span id="s119">I mean, I was in charge of all the mail that went out, magazines, books, packages.</span> <span id="s120">The railway was employed, you know, with bigger mails then the post offices, you know, so I was in charge of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q. Now, what was that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A.</span> <span id="s123">It was 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s125">So Hitler had just taken over in Germany in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A. Uh-huh (indicates affirmatively).</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s128">Well, what was it about the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses that put them on a head-to-head collision, so to speak, with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party?</span> <span id="s129">What were your beliefs that caused that?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A. See, we weren't actually affected by it yet, you know, because Czechoslovakia was different, it was democracy and the various ways freedom.</span> <span id="s131">Though in some services from house to house they would find points they could -- for instance, one booklet would have 64 pages, ja.</span> <span id="s132">And then in order to make it attractive, cover was put on.</span> <span id="s133">And they considered this as a second printing sheet, you know.</span> <span id="s134">So very often it was we were arrested because it was beyond the normal printing sheet.</span> <span id="s135">So short arrest was well made.</span> <span id="s136">And I was a couple of times involved with police, but every time I got away free.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s138">Well, what was it about the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses though that put them on a head-to-head collision with Hitler and the Nazi Party when they finally did take over in Czechoslovakia?</span> <span id="s139">What were your beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A. My beliefs were that Jehovah God is the sovereign ruler of the universe, which would include our earth, as the most high.</span> <span id="s141">Christ Jesus was ruling in the midst of his enemy as the king.</span> <span id="s142">His kingdom would be the only instrument which would diverse the whole situation and bring final peace on earth and paradise condition which actually was Jehovah's original purpose, to make this earth a paradise.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q. Do you mean the whole earth would be a paradise?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s145">And mankind's greatest enemy, death, will be done away permanently.</span> <span id="s146">No government could make such a promise.</span> <span id="s147">And that was actually pointed out already by Abraham, you know, when he says, "All nations or individuals of the nations will bless themselves."</span> <span id="s148">And this actually shows actions.</span> <span id="s149">Most Bible translations say we will be blessed.</span> <span id="s150">But this means a passive waiting until it comes.</span> <span id="s151">But when it says, "Will bless themselves," they have to do something in order to reach this action.</span> <span id="s152">They got to be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q.</span> <span id="s154">So then you feel that the whole earth will one day be at peace and be a paradise?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s156">That was God's promise.</span> <span id="s157">That was his original purpose, though the first couple failed, Adam and Eve.</span> <span id="s158">But it doesn't mean that Jehovah God shelved his original purpose.</span> <span id="s159">It still is main objective.</span> <span id="s160">And that's why actually Christ died.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s162">Well, why won't Jehovah's Witnesses go into the army?</span> <span id="s163">Why didn't they support Hitler since other Christian religions were doing that and joining the armies?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A. Though we respect them as secular authorities and believe under Romans, you know, in the 13th Chapter, showed we should be subject to the secular authorities, but it does not mean that they are the only authorities.</span> <span id="s165">The Bible shows us, for instance, we have to do a certain work as Jesus instituted, the preaching of the good news from house to house to all the nations, ja.</span> <span id="s166">And then forbid this.</span> <span id="s167">They act the same as the Apostles did.</span> <span id="s168">As it is stated, we have to obey God more than the other governments.</span> <span id="s169">It means God is the prominence.</span> <span id="s170">For instance, when they start a war and then they feel we should give our life and everything for the government or for the president, we cannot do that.</span> <span id="s171">What's left for God?</span> <span id="s172">The Bible says we should give to those governments what is due to them, to pay taxes and many other things.</span> <span id="s173">They make electricity, the streets, and all the other things we obey.</span> <span id="s174">We are the best citizens in this regard.</span> <span id="s175">But when it contradicts God's government or God's principals we cannot obey.</span> <span id="s176">What's left then for God if you give everything to the Caesars?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q.</span> <span id="s178">So then you wouldn't go then into the armies of Hitler to kill other people then?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A. No, we wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s180">It's interesting that the Hebrew scriptures, the prophet Isaiah, for instance, has something to say that helps us to understand it.</span> <span id="s181">In the second chapter of Isaiah, numbers 2 to 4, and it must occur in the first final part of the days that's our time that the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains.</span> <span id="s182">Mountains in the scripture refer to governments, ja.</span> <span id="s183">And it will certainly be lifted up above all else.</span> <span id="s184">So actually, the highest government that exists.</span> <span id="s185">And to it all nations or individuals of nations will stream, and many people will certainly go and say, come, you people, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the House of the God of Jacob, and He will instruct us about his ways and we will walk in His path for our Zion law will go forth and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem, that means the Heavenly Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s186">And he will certainly render judgment among the nations and set matters straight, redeeming many peoples.</span> <span id="s187">And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.</span> <span id="s188">Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.</span> <span id="s189">So how could we read such an instruction as the Bible says, kill our Christian brothers, for instance, as in some countries or most of the countries Catholics in the First and Second World War killed Catholics, protestants killed protestants.</span> <span id="s190">So actually killing -- or we are lifting the sword or the rifles against our own Christian brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q.</span> <span id="s192">So that was the reason that Jehovah's Witnesses didn't go to war then?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s194">Then there's another reason, the apostle Paul shows us in Second Corinthians, 10th Chapter, that our warfare is not a fleshly one.</span> <span id="s195">For instance, when the apostle Paul mentioned in Ephesians, the 6th Chapter, our fight is not against flesh and blood but against superior and visible authorities.</span> <span id="s196">How could you succeed fighting invisible spirit creatures or authorities with carnal reference?</span> <span id="s197">It would be just foolish.</span> <span id="s198">And that's what the apostle Paul has to say in the Second -- Second Corinthians, the 10th Chapter, Versus 3: For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage warfare according to what we are in the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful by God for our turning strongly entranced things for we are overturning reasoning every lofty things raise up against the knowledge of God and we are bringing every thought in captivity the sake to be obedient to Christ.</span> <span id="s199">So here the apostle Paul says woe if I don't declare the good news from house to house about God's kingdom.</span> <span id="s200">And then he also said, and in this way he will not share the blood guilt what the nations have toward God by fighting each other and killing each other.</span> <span id="s201">He said, "I am free of this blood guilt.</span> <span id="s202">If -- if we would desist on warning the people about this we would be blood guilty in the eyes of Jehovah and Christ Jesus as king.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s204">Well, let's go back then to the time that you went to your branch headquarters there in Prague.</span> <span id="s205">What was your assignment there and what type of activity did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A. Ja, I ran the shipping department, ja, and I was in charge of everything what had to be shipped to pioneers and the congregations and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q. Where were you sending the information, the publications, to -- to what countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A. Oh, not only to Germany but also to the -- I mean, Czechoslovakia, but also other countries, you know, like eastern countries, ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q. Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively.)</span> <span id="s210">Your society had their headquarters for Germany in the City of Magdeburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A. Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q. Now, When they were closed down did you help out in any way by taking over what they had done?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A.</span> <span id="s214">You see, Switzerland was actually -- the Swiss branch was in charge of everything, as Brother Rutherford put Brother Hardwick in charge of whole Europe.</span> <span id="s215">And then pioneers and everything.</span> <span id="s216">But they were sent from Prague as pioneers whether it's Hungary or other countries, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s218">Now, when was it that Hitler finally came into Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A. See, it was 1938 that Hitler insisted to take the German part to annex it with the rest of Germany.</span> <span id="s220">He said the so-called -- I would say the fringe, you know, of the country.</span> <span id="s221">Now, all Germans right up into Bohemia, Corispot (phonetic), Rutenberg, all German cities and German people living, you know, and he tried to get this.</span> <span id="s222">So the Czechoslovakian army mobilized.</span> <span id="s223">And I, since I was a soldier at the age of twenty years, they just called me back and I refused everything.</span> <span id="s224">Then suddenly one of the head generals or what he was in charge, officer of the army, he delivered a speech, and he said, "So, soldiers, now our president demands your life blood for the fatherland."</span> <span id="s225">After he had finished I approached him and I said, "I listened to your talk.</span> <span id="s226">I am not obeying the least of it because I am a Christian and believe in the Bible and will be guided by God's instruction with the -- written in the Bible."</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q.</span> <span id="s228">So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A.</span> <span id="s230">So he had me arrested right way.</span> <span id="s231">And then after some time, maybe a few days, Hitler took the so-called German part the Sudetenland, and annexed it to the rest of Germany without war.</span> <span id="s232">And then I was released and then approached this officer.</span> <span id="s233">Had.</span> <span id="s234">I had -- in the meantime I received books, you know, of that time, for instance, in Germany restricted here I have Vindication, the book of Vindication.</span> <span id="s235">There were three parts dealing with the social, _________, the book Lights, the book Light, two parts giving fine information; and the book Deliverance, here, a book at that time.</span> <span id="s236">And all those books were actually forbidden at this time.</span> <span id="s237">It's interesting here I just would remember since I was in charge of the shipping department, I was asked to send Rigista (phonetic), a book, a book Rigista to Hitler that he must have received it and read it.</span> <span id="s238">I see from this comment my father being an old party member of the Nazis, says, ja, when he came home once he said, "Today our Fuehrer spoke about you."</span> <span id="s239">He said the -- "Our Fuehrer spoke about you."</span> <span id="s240">He said, "There comes this American, Judge Rutherford, and he claims that we are from the devil and we are going to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s241">But I'm telling you this time, not Heyman will be hanged, but Mordechai."</span> <span id="s242">I referring to this book, you know, that deals with Heyman and Mordechai ___________, you know, so he must have read it or else how could he have read those comments?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q.</span> <span id="s244">So he was very upset with Jehovah's Witnesses even over that?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A.</span> <span id="s246">He was very upset.</span> <span id="s247">As we know from later information he even went so far when hundreds of thousands of telegrams came, you know, to his office and comments where he threw the -- smashed the ink bottle against the wall and said, "These brood are going to be exterminated."</span> <span id="s248">He had in mind to wipe out Jehovah's Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q.</span> <span id="s250">Did your branch office send one of those telegrams to Hitler saying he should stop prosecuting Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A. I don't -- I don't recall that, but we were not involved so much as Germany themselves.</span> <span id="s252">For instance, my wife's parents, ja, they had a part in doing this and was actually quite risky.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q. Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively).</span> <span id="s254">Okay.</span> <span id="s255">So when was it then that Hitler came into Czechoslovakia and took over, and what began to happen to you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A. See, then when I was released and I went to this high officer there, I said -- he said, "Are you remaining here or are you going to Germany?</span> <span id="s257">"No," I said, "my place is in Prague at the branch, you know, of the Watch Tower Society, and I'm going back."</span> <span id="s258">So when I give him a witness he just shed tears and congratulated me.</span> <span id="s259">Really, I was amazed about his changes, you know, ja.</span> <span id="s260">Then I came back and the police had instructed us already that everything is in the hand of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s261">Hitler insisted, though he said he's not interested in the rest of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q.</span> <span id="s263">You mean he had already taken over Czechoslovakia now?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A. No, he didn't.</span> <span id="s265">He hadn't taken over yet.</span> <span id="s266">But he aimed to do so, you know.</span> <span id="s267">And he didn't -- he hadn't taken complete Sudets, you know, he just started with it.</span> <span id="s268">And when I came back I right away sent three 20-ton railway wagons with German literature, sent it into the German Sudet, you know, so when this was becoming Germany, you know, they had all the German literature for -- enough for the whole war.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s270">So then what happened after that then?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A. And then the police instructed us and they said they can do nothing anymore.</span> <span id="s272">It's all in the hand of the Gestapo since Hitler had insisted that this German university should remain open.</span> <span id="s273">And in reality it was only a Gestapo center for the training center.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q. Now, what was that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A. Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q. Was that the German school or was that the one in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A. That's in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q.</span> <span id="s279">What was the name of that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A. Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q.</span> <span id="s282">What was the name of that school in Prague?</span> <span id="s283">Was that the Czechoslovakian school?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A. I don't get you what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q.</span> <span id="s286">What was the school that Hitler wanted to remain open?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A. No, that was the German university.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q. Oh, the German University?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A. German university, ja, and it was only a Gestapo training center.</span> <span id="s290">Then we received the order, you know, from the governing body to dismantle the machines and to be shipped to Holland to print there.</span> <span id="s291">So one morning our lawyer came and say, gets up 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s292">He said German troops marching from six sites into Prague.</span> <span id="s293">So we were prepared.</span> <span id="s294">We dismantled the machines and then didn't take long the Gestapo came there but the machines and everything was already in boxes.</span> <span id="s295">And then we freight papers, and everything was given to the shippers, you know, the movers, and they were in charge of handling it right to -- into Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q.</span> <span id="s297">Now why didn't they confiscate those printing presses and so on even though they were in boxes?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A.</span> <span id="s299">You know, they still were scared of the USA.</span> <span id="s300">They said, "We never touch German properties," ja.</span> <span id="s301">That's why they didn't touch it, didn't prevent it, ja.</span> <span id="s302">But what they did when the Gestapo came once to ransack the branch, they said they are looking only for two German brothers, that was Karl Krowser and my name, since I had the last time before this happened everything sent under my name so they were looking already for me.</span> <span id="s303">And it's interesting then when they came there and they would order me -- we had, for instance, on the boxes outside we had the language that was printed and inside written on.</span> <span id="s304">But we used those cartons when they were empty and put other literature in it.</span> <span id="s305">What they got here were all archaic languages we never used: Arabic, Egypt, and all this.</span> <span id="s306">So they asked me to put all this into a room and then they sealed the room.</span> <span id="s307">There was no German literature there.</span> <span id="s308">And they were interested only in German literature that had been moved already before in those railway wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s310">So then the reason then the Germans didn't pick up the printing presses is because it had USA --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A. Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q. -- written on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A. Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q. And they had respect for the United States, or fear or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A. Uh-huh (indicates affirmatively).</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q. Hum, very interesting.</span> <span id="s317">Now, how did the presses get all the way to Holland, just by these shippers?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A. Ja, they used the Rhine, ja.</span> <span id="s319">And first the Elbe and then the Rhine -- and then the Rhine, you know.</span> <span id="s320">And then when they came and opened bolts, you know, what it is, four weeks and all this getting rusty.</span> <span id="s321">And then put Harbeck in charge of all Europe, he came with an engineer brother and he said, "Now we will unpack this and we will have to clean everything from rust."</span> <span id="s322">In six weeks he comes and show us how to put it together.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q.</span> <span id="s324">So you went to Holland at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A. Ja, we were brought to Holland, but it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s326">You want me to relate it in details, ja?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q.</span> <span id="s328">So how did you get to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A.</span> <span id="s330">You know, I was in actually to Holland -- we went to -- we were in Vienna, ja.</span> <span id="s331">First we -- in the nighttime we made our escape.</span> <span id="s332">And then I got a card for invitation for child's baptism where wine and everything is prepared for it and it was Dusseldorf, maybe two-and-a-half million inhabitants.</span> <span id="s333">And I said, "What can I do with this card?</span> <span id="s334">It has only the city on and no address."</span> <span id="s335">Then a brother who was with me, he got a card and it said I received a card and only a street is on it.</span> <span id="s336">I don't know what to do it.</span> <span id="s337">I said, "Let's put it together and maybe they fit."</span> <span id="s338">So then we find out that right away the next day we traveled to Dusseldorf.</span> <span id="s339">And when we came there and the address that didn't know anything there were not even witnesses, they were some people, you know, study with, "wait.</span> <span id="s340">You stay here and in morning -- tomorrow we don't find out anything we show you the harbor."</span> <span id="s341">We were on the way out and suddenly a lady came and said, "I am Aunt Bertha.</span> <span id="s342">Didn't you get my letter?"</span> <span id="s343">We said, "Yes, we got one but didn't know what to do," we said.</span> <span id="s344">"And the two boys, take them right away along."</span> <span id="s345">So we went in the train and she instructed us.</span> <span id="s346">We said Rahab was considered a harlot but she was a faithful sister risking even her life.</span> <span id="s347">She changed.</span> <span id="s348">She said, "What I will do I will do the same, though they might think of me whatever they want.</span> <span id="s349">But there is no other way since the Hollandish troops even when you get there you would not get through the barricades.</span> <span id="s350">There is only one way.</span> <span id="s351">I have a farm close to the border.</span> <span id="s352">There will be a light there.</span> <span id="s353">I arranged it already.</span> <span id="s354">And then one will take me and one the other one, my daughter, and we will embrace as love couples through those soldiers."</span> <span id="s355">They know her.</span> <span id="s356">But otherwise we couldn't get through.</span> <span id="s357">Then she instructed us, "But now you will meet John.</span> <span id="s358">He's a Gestapo man."</span> <span id="s359">When we heard that we didn't feel so easy.</span> <span id="s360">Then when we saw him we said, "Why he has this job to keep the connection open with Germany and then he had to report every day to the Gestapo about Jehovah's Witnesses."</span> <span id="s361">So he was actually having a very risky life, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q.</span> <span id="s363">So he was one of Jehovah's Witnesses then?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A.</span> <span id="s365">He was one of Jehovah's Witnesses, took this job to keep the on-going work going.</span> <span id="s366">Now, when we saw him and he instructed us and said, "If they catch me, they kill me.</span> <span id="s367">I take you only under this condition: That you are not afraid.</span> <span id="s368">When they shoot at us you don't stop.</span> <span id="s369">We run whether we make it or not.</span> <span id="s370">It's all in Jehovah's hands."</span> <span id="s371">And, you know -- so we then -- we felt good, comfortable, you know.</span> <span id="s372">Then we went through the swamps there and finally we waited in corn field.</span> <span id="s373">And he left to midnight.</span> <span id="s374">And then the sister came with her daughter to pick up us.</span> <span id="s375">We embraced her and then the brothers already were working in the house from the branch, you know.</span> <span id="s376">And they took us to the -- right to the Atlantic, Hamsted, where the battle -- where all the branch was in Holland.</span> <span id="s377">And we were six times stopped on the road on the barricades of the army.</span> <span id="s378">And they would ask everyone, Holland, Dutch people.</span> <span id="s379">We said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s380">We produced those passports, they saluted.</span> <span id="s381">See, sometime if you are such an assignment how they are blinded by experience.</span> <span id="s382">So we set up the printing plant for the Harbrick with these engineer brother came, everything was running.</span> <span id="s383">And then Brother Verner, he was then the branch officer, overseer.</span> <span id="s384">He was seeing the governor with our falsified passports because we were actually -- Gestapo was looking for us, you know, so we couldn't have legal passport.</span> <span id="s385">And then he just wanted to put in the stamp.</span> <span id="s386">As one of the other officers said, "You cannot do that.</span> <span id="s387">There is no legal entry."</span> <span id="s388">So they had to arrest us.</span> <span id="s389">And they says he will contact the governor and everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s390">So we were overnight there and the next day at the plain-clothes policemen or detectives, you know, they had handcuffed us, and came to the railway station, the branch and sisters and brothers were there to say, "Get out, away," you know.</span> <span id="s391">And the branch overseer said, "Why do you handcuff the people?"</span> <span id="s392">They said, "Oh, it's just a gesture.</span> <span id="s393">In the train the handcuffs will be put away."</span> <span id="s394">When we were in the train and I said, "What about those handcuffs?"</span> <span id="s395">He said, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s396">You will be turned over to the Gestapo, the German authorities."</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q.</span> <span id="s398">So he was going to turn you in then?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s400">So we give in to this and said, "Nothing can be done.</span> <span id="s401">Pray to Jehovah."</span> <span id="s402">And then on the last station before we came to the German custom office, you know, the Dutch custom, the train stopped.</span> <span id="s403">There was a delay, didn't know what happened to the train.</span> <span id="s404">Ten minutes.</span> <span id="s405">So we went into the waiting room and then sudden a phone call came.</span> <span id="s406">It was the governor from Denmark.</span> <span id="s407">He had forgotten about this and now he recalled it and remembered it and said, "They must be on the border already."</span> <span id="s408">And they said, "Those two boys never to be given over to the German authorities.</span> <span id="s409">You wait until you get further orders."</span> <span id="s410">So they put us in prison.</span> <span id="s411">And then his wife treated us as if we would be guests, and she said, "My husband will come and give you further instruction."</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q.</span> <span id="s413">So he had forgotten and then when he remembered you were just getting ready to go over the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s415">And then he came and he said, "In the evening the army will come.</span> <span id="s416">They will load you onto an army truck and advise you how to get, you know, to get saved there and you will not fall into the hands of the Gestapo."</span> <span id="s417">So we -- what they did, they put us on the railroad track on, you know, the gravel, and all this.</span> <span id="s418">If it betrays you run right into the hand of the authorities.</span> <span id="s419">So we decided we go down into the swamps, you know, beside those railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s420">And we were on our elbows crawling.</span> <span id="s421">Have you ever been crawling for hours waiting?</span> <span id="s422">You think your own heart will betray you, you know, you bumps so loud.</span> <span id="s423">And suddenly we heard German custom, you know, "Unholten."</span> <span id="s424">That means stops.</span> <span id="s425">But that didn't mean us, cars and trucks what they stopped.</span> <span id="s426">But we knew now where the custom office, where the German custom were.</span> <span id="s427">So we crawled and then we waited.</span> <span id="s428">He give us instruction when we get there we should remain in the forest until in the morning but never take for 60 or 80 kilometers be it bus or tram, whatever it is, because Gestapo is checking everything.</span> <span id="s429">Since it was a beautiful night we decided we walk a little bit to make headway.</span> <span id="s430">It didn't take long we were stopped by Gestapo men, two Gestapo men.</span> <span id="s431">And then the one who stopped us, the other one said to him, "What do you want?</span> <span id="s432">Can't you see they are our people?"</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q.</span> <span id="s434">So he you were Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A. Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q.</span> <span id="s437">What was the reason he thought you were one of the Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A. No, not only Gestapo, but Germans, you know, and employed, you know, because we had the same hats and then the trench coats and all.</span> <span id="s439">I had the experience more often the brothers would mistake me for Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s440">They said, 'You look the same and behaved the same way as they do," you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q.</span> <span id="s442">So you actually served as a protection for you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s444">And then we decided now we still obey the order there and we remain in the forest.</span> <span id="s445">And in the morning when we woke up we were actually sleeping in the park, city park.</span> <span id="s446">So we took off heading -- we walked for 60 or 80 kilometers, and then we went to Vienna and Holland.</span> <span id="s447">Holland, the brothers knew already the address, you know, where they could contact us.</span> <span id="s448">And suddenly I was contacted by a brother who was for this undergoing work headed in Dresden what did it before me, introduced me, and I was doing it, mimeographing the Watch Tower with another brother and then delivering to the brothers.</span> <span id="s449">And then I had when two brothers in Salzburg were shot, I got the assignment since Himmler, the Gestapo chief had the brother and sisters arrested, to reorganize there.</span> <span id="s450">The brothers were very much in fear of this, you know, and to meet anyone.</span> <span id="s451">And when I contacted the brother in Braunschweig.</span> <span id="s452">It was Hitler's birth part, you know, and I ask him to introduce me in Salzburg so I could start because it was the organization feature procedure, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q.</span> <span id="s454">In other words, now you were in charge of all the Austrian work --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A. Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q. -- all the underground work in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s458">Ja.</span> <span id="s459">And then there were others like Hansey (phoenetic) also was traveling with me.</span> <span id="s460">She was actually doing underground work, too.</span> <span id="s461">But when I send her home, you know, she didn't know, she just -- that's in the last years' yearbooks dated.</span> <span id="s462">He said, "The brothers asked me to visit," and this was a mistake and I was arrested.</span> <span id="s463">In reality, it was my assignment.</span> <span id="s464">I stayed for ten days there.</span> <span id="s465">Young brothers received the papers, you know, to report to the army and they were desperate what to do.</span> <span id="s466">So sometimes until 4:00 in the morning I stayed.</span> <span id="s467">I had the latest information, you know, to help them with the Watch Tower neutrality.</span> <span id="s468">And I wasn't arrested there, I was arrested later on, on another trip.</span> <span id="s469">It was -- I wanted to leave at 6:00 in the morning and then Mussoliniâ€™s coal transport led this train, this 6:00 train, fall out and had to wait until 9:00.</span> <span id="s470">And suddenly I was surrounded by six Gestapo men who came on this brother who was released by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s471">And they said, "He has such a faith you could kill him you will never get a word out of him."</span> <span id="s472">But now he done pale like chalk, white like a wall, you know, so there must be something fishy.</span> <span id="s473">Then they turn to me and say, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s474">I say, "Aren't I allowed to see my uncle?"</span> <span id="s475">And they grabbed me and led me outside.</span> <span id="s476">There were two more sitting in the car.</span> <span id="s477">And they said, "Your uncle?</span> <span id="s478">We will find out."</span> <span id="s479">So they took me right away to the prison and then they took me to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s480">And the whole day they interrogated me.</span> <span id="s481">They had me stripped in the nude.</span> <span id="s482">They wouldn't even let me go to the toilet.</span> <span id="s483">They followed me.</span> <span id="s484">And then in the meantime since I had the slip, I had the -- my suitcase, you know, at the railway station in the locker, they had found it because I put this already -- I wanted to leave in my pocket.</span> <span id="s485">So they got this and now they wanted to know there was a bunch of keys who they belonged to and then magazines, some packages were still left, and they said, "Ja, we have to find out where all those go.</span> <span id="s486">We will get this out of him."</span> <span id="s487">But they didn't get out of -- not one word out of me.</span> <span id="s488">On the magazines, packages I had codes.</span> <span id="s489">They would never find out.</span> <span id="s490">And the keys I wouldn't tell them.</span> <span id="s491">The brothers gave me keys because you don't realize it was war and completely every house had to be darkened, you know.</span> <span id="s492">Those tar papers had to be on the window.</span> <span id="s493">Not the lightest -- not the lightest light could come out, no street lights or nothing.</span> <span id="s494">How could you come when you arrived in a city like Innsbruck or what, how could you come in the nighttime without noticing -- without finding anything if you wouldn't have a key?</span> <span id="s495">You wouldn't even know where.</span> <span id="s496">The brothers didn't know when I would arrive, you know.</span> <span id="s497">So they wanted to know where I got all this and I wouldn't tell them.</span> <span id="s498">Then they said to me, "Okay.</span> <span id="s499">When we come to Kratz, that was the capital of this part of the country, "...you will talk.</span> <span id="s500">When you come under the wheels you will talk like a waterfall."</span> <span id="s501">That means for sure, no?</span> <span id="s502">We said, "Would Hitler go with you?</span> <span id="s503">If you would betray Hitler he could hang you or shoot you.</span> <span id="s504">What you think what Jehovah God will do with me if I betray my brothers?"</span> <span id="s505">Do you know what this head interrogator said?</span> <span id="s506">"We can kill these men.</span> <span id="s507">You will not get one word out of them."</span> <span id="s508">And then we went to Kratz and they put me there in a cell.</span> <span id="s509">I heard one scream on the side was beaten and he said, "Be quiet or you get another beating."</span> <span id="s510">And I saw the mattress there was full of blood.</span> <span id="s511">Somebody might have been beaten up.</span> <span id="s512">And they give orders they should not lock it.</span> <span id="s513">They will take me overnight, you know.</span> <span id="s514">And then they had to arrest for fourteen days Communists so they didn't have any time when I would reconnect myself when it got time finally so I had mostly night times interrogations.</span> <span id="s515">When I came back to the cell the tears would rund down, I broke down, you know.</span> <span id="s516">But when the key was rattling in the keyhole I wiped my tears and prayed to Jehovah for strength and it was all right.</span> <span id="s517">They could try whatever they wanted, they could not get one word out.</span> <span id="s518">For instance, one day when they had beaten this brother where I was arrested ruthlessly, and they called me in.</span> <span id="s519">And I said, "How could you beat this brother when he had the head injury?</span> <span id="s520">He had quite a __________ on his head injury.</span> <span id="s521">He had quite a_______ on his head and he cannot remember the things.</span> <span id="s522">They were lying pigs.</span> <span id="s523">I guarantee you none of you will leave this room alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q.</span> <span id="s525">They said that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s527">What I said now, "If it is Jehovah's will we will die.</span> <span id="s528">But if not, no matter what you're going to try and even have our head, we will perish.</span> <span id="s529">I I thought how they will fall over us.</span> <span id="s530">You see every time was that I give a witness to Jehovah, that I entrusted in Jehovah.</span> <span id="s531">And, you know, now I thought, "Now they will finish us."</span> <span id="s532">What happened, the one in charge of the interrogation in a very soft voice gave orders to be led to our cells.</span> <span id="s533">So here in Bible says Jehovah's name is of strong power and the righteous one runs into it in his security.</span> <span id="s534">One of those brothers takes any credit that he was courageous, it is Jehovah who is the healer, who keeps us holding us up if we just obey his commandments and try to please him and never give in to compromise.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q. Now, what was it now you're speaking of right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A.</span> <span id="s537">This was the year January 14 --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q. 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A. 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q. Forty, okay.</span> <span id="s541">So that's when you were picked up.</span> <span id="s542">Okay.</span> <span id="s543">From there were you sent to a camp or series of camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A. No.</span> <span id="s545">I was now expecting that I would get a court case.</span> <span id="s546">And I awaited anyway with all this treason, all this having connection with foreign countries, it was on this alone death sentence, you know.</span> <span id="s547">So I was -- really I thought when they have me my head will roll anyway, uh-huh (indicates affirmatively).</span> <span id="s548">So then the court case came and then the one -- they send one to defend me from the party, from the government.</span> <span id="s549">And he said, maybe to help me innocently since this other brother had head injury, they thought if they would investigate maybe this other this one who is accused here they might find the same conditions.</span> <span id="s550">When I heard that I said, "Please.</span> <span id="s551">I don't need to defend.</span> <span id="s552">I will defend myself."</span> <span id="s553">So the judge agreed to that.</span> <span id="s554">And I thought, "Now I will deliver a witness for Jehovah's name."</span> <span id="s555">After I had finished, you know what the Judge said?</span> <span id="s556">"As you can see from his discourse, we have here one of the most dangerous antagonizers of the set and I am convinced the family where he was arrested, and this they are here, the court case at the court, they are innocent and he is the one who betrayed and deceives them with his sect.</span> <span id="s557">Now, as we can see out of his defending we have here this men is so dangerous he should not be left free.</span> <span id="s558">Now you realize if you would stand before this special court today you would be executed.</span> <span id="s559">And they said, "I sentence you to ten years penitentiary and this should tart the count after the war is over."</span> <span id="s560">That means I wasn't starting with my sentence that should start 1945, but they didn't know when the war was over, 1945 when the war was over, that's why I was sent to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q.</span> <span id="s562">So they thought they were going to win the war and after the war was won you then would start serving your ten years?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A. Ten years, ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s565">So now you went to a camp.</span> <span id="s566">What camp did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A.</span> <span id="s568">It was on the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s569">Emslander is what it is, actually one camp that was the most famous on cruelty, Esterwegen.</span> <span id="s570">This one -- this continued after 1938.</span> <span id="s571">So I was sent to the same thing, you know, to cultivate swamps, you know.</span> <span id="s572">And this was BoÌˆrgermoor, camp number 2.</span> <span id="s573">And I was -- Ashemdorgerham was camp number 2 and BoÌˆrgermoor number 3.</span> <span id="s574">And, for instance, camp number 5 were Russians, camp number 6 were Poles, and so on, you know.</span> <span id="s575">So when I came there I get a nice reception.</span> <span id="s576">And as soon as you go from the trucks down the beatings starts.</span> <span id="s577">Then you have all the signs, "Any resistance will meet brute reaction," you know, that means with any force they will break you.</span> <span id="s578">And then there was a kind of registration.</span> <span id="s579">We said, "Who shall we report to if something happen to you?"</span> <span id="s580">And they said nothing will happen to me.</span> <span id="s581">And the one said, "We will see how quick it goes."</span> <span id="s582">So -- and the criminals, they are running the camp actually and they have any power.</span> <span id="s583">They can do whatever they want.</span> <span id="s584">If they kill you they report one died.</span> <span id="s585">So it's everything, but you don't feel you are in their hands.</span> <span id="s586">You feel you are in Jehovah's hands.</span> <span id="s587">That's why you are confidence.</span> <span id="s588">But one thing: Unless Armageddon comes you will never get out here alive.</span> <span id="s589">It wasâ€¦</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q.</span> <span id="s591">So what was the year now you were sent to that camp?</span> <span id="s592">Was it 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A. Ja, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q.</span> <span id="s595">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A. Approximately in the middle of 1940, June, July or -- autumn.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q. June or July.</span> <span id="s598">So _______ was one.</span> <span id="s599">Now, what was the day in the camp, that camp, like?</span> <span id="s600">What was it that you were required to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A.</span> <span id="s602">We had -- we had -a pensum to cultivate the swamps so it would be a productive land.</span> <span id="s603">So got the pensum, was twenty cubic meters, ja, depending how deep you got to go.</span> <span id="s604">And sometimes you got to dig until you hit sand.</span> <span id="s605">And the first sand is like a rock.</span> <span id="s606">Maybe you get half an inch or inch with the spade, you know, so you had to work on it.</span> <span id="s607">And then until you got to dig until you hit loose sand.</span> <span id="s608">Sometimes you have to go four meter deep or sometimes you have these black moor oak.</span> <span id="s609">It's like a rock.</span> <span id="s610">You can no use ax on it, it's just too hard, you know.</span> <span id="s611">But they don't consider that.</span> <span id="s612">At 3:00 in the afternoon they check if you are able to make it.</span> <span id="s613">If not then it goes on the spotplutz, on the spotplutz.</span> <span id="s614">That means crawling.</span> <span id="s615">And they hit you with rifles, rifle butts, and so on.</span> <span id="s616">So half of them they go into their reviewing we call hospital in the camp.</span> <span id="s617">It was a revel, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q. Now, were you the only Jehovah's Witnesses in there doing the digging in that ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A. No.</span> <span id="s620">There were -- for instance, there were six brothers.</span> <span id="s621">And we were cooperating with each other and this way we should make the thing because we were helping each other.</span> <span id="s622">And it's interesting in this respect.</span> <span id="s623">There was one of those, you know, hypnotists, what they are, entertainer.</span> <span id="s624">And we helped him.</span> <span id="s625">He was such a little man, you know.</span> <span id="s626">And to thank us one day he stood there and he screamed, "Jehovah's Witnesses making propaganda.</span> <span id="s627">Jehovah's Witnesses making propaganda."</span> <span id="s628">We shook him and foam was coming from his mouth.</span> <span id="s629">I think he didn't even know what he was doing.</span> <span id="s630">So we could see completely used by demons or demonized.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q.</span> <span id="s632">After helping him?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A. Ja, after helping him.</span> <span id="s634">So I realized even in the gas -- gas cell when I was brought in was a demonized doctor.</span> <span id="s635">When I saw him he had pierced his eyes out, you know, with, you know, those -- I think pencil.</span> <span id="s636">And it was looking ugly.</span> <span id="s637">And I felt so sorry I wanted to witness to him.</span> <span id="s638">He looked at me, and then he said, "I am a doctor and I can cut my leg off but it wouldn't help me.</span> <span id="s639">Only when I am blind.</span> <span id="s640">That's why I pierce my eyes.</span> <span id="s641">But they said only the eye water run out and I will see again.</span> <span id="s642">But only when I am blind I am not going to be thrown into concentration camp."</span> <span id="s643">So he did this.</span> <span id="s644">And then what he said to me, "I smuggled blades in here, razor blades, and you will cut my eyes out."</span> <span id="s645">Since I didn't do that he jumped in my legs and reported things about me that I could have been executed for, the lies what he told them.</span> <span id="s646">They don't believe a Witness, they believe such as kook righter, you know.</span> <span id="s647">And I asked if I could get out of this cell because this man is not normal.</span> <span id="s648">And then when I was in the camp one day there was a notice there Professor Doctor Schmidt being executed.</span> <span id="s649">Do you know what he did?</span> <span id="s650">For fear, you know, to come to a camp he accused himself of being involved in communist activity, and for this he was executed.</span> <span id="s651">In the camp where I was, I just was in here because they cut ________ out of my back when I done that.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q.</span> <span id="s653">So what time did your day begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A.</span> <span id="s655">Our day begun 6:00, you know, a bell.</span> <span id="s656">And then -- but in reality they threw us out already 4:00 in the morning or even before sometime.</span> <span id="s657">As I said those gangsters they are running the whole camp.</span> <span id="s658">They have all the power.</span> <span id="s659">You can do nothing with them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q. Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively.)</span> <span id="s661">So then?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A.</span> <span id="s663">But as long as it's daylight, you know.</span> <span id="s664">They wouldn't let you in the dark because of fear somebody escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s666">Very good.</span> <span id="s667">Please like to tell us if any other people in your family were in the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A. Yes, my uncle.</span> <span id="s669">He was in concentration camp in Everettsberg) and Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s670">And when he came there they would ask, "Who is the carpenter?"</span> <span id="s671">"Who is the bricklayer?"</span> <span id="s672">He was a farmer.</span> <span id="s673">He said, "I can do brick laying," you know.</span> <span id="s674">But he didn't know what he was getting himself into.</span> <span id="s675">You have to shut off -- I lost my voice now.</span> <span id="s676">(Pause.)</span> <span id="s677">What he himself got into.</span> <span id="s678">He was assigned to fix up the crematory and, you know, everyone who was involved there, he never got away.</span> <span id="s679">That means when he had finished a job he will be thrown into the oven and this way outside nobody got to know what's going on there.</span> <span id="s680">So the brothers had a good organization.</span> <span id="s681">They contacted his sister which she was in RavensbrÃ¼ck next to Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp but was outside as a servant, the camp leader's wife.</span> <span id="s682">And she approached the camp leader's wife and said, because she was contacted by our brothers, that her own brother is there fixing the oven and that he will be thrown into it next.</span> <span id="s683">So she approached the husband and they got away from there.</span> <span id="s684">They wrote a letter to me when he said, "Jehovah delivered me by means of an agent using my own sister."</span> <span id="s685">And you know, she -- she was working in a dairy store.</span> <span id="s686">And one of the Gestapo came in one morning and said, "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s687">And she said, "Good morgen," good morning.</span> <span id="s688">And then he said, "Don't you know how to greet?</span> <span id="s689">I wish you a nice beautiful good morning.</span> <span id="s690">You come along."</span> <span id="s691">That's the way why she was arrested.</span> <span id="s692">And she was sitting for nine year.</span> <span id="s693">Can you imagine just because of the greeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q.</span> <span id="s695">So what was the camp that she was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A. RavensbrÃ¼ck.</span> <span id="s697">Czechoslovakia was tough, too.</span> <span id="s698">The women did the same work as the men.</span> <span id="s699">They did the same hard work.</span> <span id="s700">But later on sisters were used outside the camp.</span> <span id="s701">They were logisted in the camp, ja.</span> <span id="s702">And then so there were -- they had entrusted occupations because they trusted them.</span> <span id="s703">For instance, the camp leader's wife, Boidy (phonetic) was her name, "You train the children the way you feel it's right."</span> <span id="s704">So she actually didn't very much problems.</span> <span id="s705">But then the sisters would mimeograph in the pigs' sty for the men's concentration camp books and Watch Towers that are brought from Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q.</span> <span id="s707">You mean they actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A. By Dr. Kersten.</span> <span id="s709">It was Dr. Himmler's, the Gestapo chief, Himmler's doctor and was the only one who could relieve him of his pains.</span> <span id="s710">He would for instance come and say, "Sisters, what shall I bring you from Sweden?"</span> <span id="s711">You know.</span> <span id="s712">So in Sweden when he came the sisters would pack the suitcase.</span> <span id="s713">He was not checked because he had this very important entrusted position.</span> <span id="s714">He was not a Jehovah's Witnesses but he was very favored for everyone.</span> <span id="s715">Then they would unpack and they were caught.</span> <span id="s716">And four five sisters were executed and Broidy, she was outside the barbed wire outside the camp.</span> <span id="s717">And they said, "We will get you, too."</span> <span id="s718">Within one month she was down to a skeleton because every day she was in fear the Gestapo could come and do away with her.</span> <span id="s719">But we met her after the war.</span> <span id="s720">She survived.</span> <span id="s721">Even have the opportunityâ€¦</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q. Can you tell me of anyone else in your family that was in prison or concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s724">My mother was in prison, and due to sickness she was so severe sick she was released early.</span> <span id="s725">And then there was a necessity on the farm of her parents.</span> <span id="s726">Also my cousin.</span> <span id="s727">I met him in BoÌˆrgermoor camp.</span> <span id="s728">He was transferred from Ashendorgerham to BoÌˆrgermoor and then he was transferred somewhere, I don't know where, to inside somewhere, I lost track where.</span> <span id="s729">But he was released in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q. Well, what happened to you now toward the end of the war?</span> <span id="s731">What actually began to take place with yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A. Toward the end of the war in January I was again asked to -- for Hitler's last hope, the so-called fork storm and I refused again.</span> <span id="s733">So this officer in command, he got mad about me, and, "I know that you're a Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s734">Nothing can be done with you.</span> <span id="s735">Take off."</span> <span id="s736">And then he called me back and he say, "I guarantee you because of your strong faith nothing will happen to you."</span> <span id="s737">So I couldn't believe him saying such a thing, you know.</span> <span id="s738">And then we found ourselves in the death march on the day to Dachau and we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q.</span> <span id="s740">How many people were with you on that death march?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A.</span> <span id="s742">A couple of thousand.</span> <span id="s743">And those who grew weak were left on the road, you know, and -- because they said, "None of you will be given into the hand of the enemies, although none of you will survive," ja.</span> <span id="s744">And -- but then they got sudden rescued by the U.S. fighting troop.</span> <span id="s745">This was a front where we were walking, and they were observing it all the way.</span> <span id="s746">But they tried to feed us but no food would hold anymore.</span> <span id="s747">So they gave us morphine shots and then they sent us out to pick.</span> <span id="s748">But after that I had many health problems, and I found out that I had two holes in my lung but I could recover with help.</span> <span id="s749">And I took privileges again and could serve the capacity, however, and now I am the presiding overseer in the Riverview congregation in Vancouver, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q.</span> <span id="s751">We want to thank you very much for the interview and the time you have taken to share this information.</span> <span id="s752">At this time we would like to introduce to the Museum your wife, so maybe we can take a few minutes and interview her.</span> <span id="s753">Would you please like to tell us who you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A. I'm Anna Schoen, and I'm coming from Germany.</span> <span id="s755">And my parents' name were Neuslan (phonetic)and I lived in Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q.</span> <span id="s757">In Bavaria?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A. And Bavaria was my first group from Nazi Germany that brought him to power with the help of the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s759">and the Bavarians were the first witness who started to hate Hitler.</span> <span id="s760">They brought him up but also brought him down.</span> <span id="s761">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s762">There was not very much "Heil Hitler" to hear.</span> <span id="s763">People liked to breathe in the morning, good-morningâ€¦He was -- he was not popular there anymore.</span> <span id="s764">And many, many people like with the Communists, we were just Nazis outside but not inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q.</span> <span id="s766">What do you remember and how old were you in 1932?</span> <span id="s767">What were some of the things you saw happening around your hometown and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A. I was just a child.</span> <span id="s769">But my mother was a Jehovah's Witnesses so the fear was always there.</span> <span id="s770">The Gestapo came to our house and searched __________.</span> <span id="s771">Then when we went to school I always believed what my mother told me even if I never attended a meeting.</span> <span id="s772">But I was always scared because of the greetings for -- in school they made you sing.</span> <span id="s773">It was -- we lived under constant fear.</span> <span id="s774">It was big, big pressure on the family.</span> <span id="s775">And my mother was sentenced to three months because of an action ___________ distributed pamphlets in the city.</span> <span id="s776">And we children didn't really know if they could come home again.</span> <span id="s777">So there was total pressure on us.</span> <span id="s778">And then my father always said, "Hitler will make war."</span> <span id="s779">And it came true.</span> <span id="s780">And I can -- today I can say as an old woman whatever my parents told me came true in every respect.</span> <span id="s781">And I believe sincerely that the future will come true too, what the Bible told us.</span> <span id="s782">And the only hope what we had was the promise of a new earth and a new heaven in which righteousness live, and that kept us going.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q. Uh-huh (indicates affirmatively).</span> <span id="s784">You're saying that your parents provided in your home help for Jehovah's Witnesses who would come to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A. Oh, yes, for all people.</span> <span id="s786">My parents were the most hospitable people I ever met.</span> <span id="s787">Our house was open to anybody regardless of religion, regardless of political, regardless of race.</span> <span id="s788">As long as they were decent people.</span> <span id="s789">Our house was a camp all our life.</span> <span id="s790">I would say, "our house."</span> <span id="s791">I mean our living quarters was always open, especially after the war when the prisons and the concentration camps opened.</span> <span id="s792">Our house was a camp.</span> <span id="s793">People met in our house who marched through the city.</span> <span id="s794">If there's any Jehovah's Witnesses they were taken in.</span> <span id="s795">All our neighbors took them in.</span> <span id="s796">And husband and wife they haven't seen each other for six, seven, eight years, they found each other.</span> <span id="s797">We had experiences and experiences and experiences.</span> <span id="s798">That went on.</span> <span id="s799">It was after -- like after Armageddon.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A.</span> <span id="s801">What about in the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A.</span> <span id="s803">In the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A.</span> <span id="s805">When the bergers were in the prison camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s807">My mother -- in the Hitler time we were in very great danger.</span> <span id="s808">We had contacted some prisoners who were working outside the camp, outside the prisons.</span> <span id="s809">They were only left with guards to work shops and picked up to the prison at night.</span> <span id="s810">But we gave them food or money and visit them constantly.</span> <span id="s811">We had connection with the prison.</span> <span id="s812">And we were -- after the prison was open hundreds of them knew about it, even if we didn't know the hundreds, maybe only knew a handful or a dozen.</span> <span id="s813">But it was fantastic, absolutely fantastic what happened.</span> <span id="s814">And because the communication and transportation was laying down after the war, people walked through the cities, walked home or you had the U.S. Army there, hitchhiked.</span> <span id="s815">So everybody stopped and many citizens ask if this was Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s816">Also many people came to us, you know.</span> <span id="s817">And it was history-making experiences we had firsthand.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q. Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively.)</span> <span id="s819">What did -- how did you feel when you heard that Hitler attacked Poland when World War II started?</span> <span id="s820">What was it that you saw change in your home town?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A.</span> <span id="s822">When Hitler attacked Poland, actually whenever he attacked anything we were always upset.</span> <span id="s823">We were worried.</span> <span id="s824">We thought he's going crazy because you cannot -- God gives us a free will to life or death.</span> <span id="s825">You cannot rule a nation totalitarian.</span> <span id="s826">You can never make people think one way.</span> <span id="s827">Everybody should have a choice.</span> <span id="s828">But when you rule with totalitarian measurements it will never ever work, no matter what it is.</span> <span id="s829">We only have to serve Jehovah with our own free will out of our heart.</span> <span id="s830">That's the only way.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q.</span> <span id="s832">When did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A. My husband?</span> <span id="s834">As I mentioned before, I contacted some Jehovah's Witnesses while I was working in a bank and they put a safe in our basement in the war.</span> <span id="s835">And they contacted them secretly.</span> <span id="s836">And when one or two of them were sentenced to death, but the death sentence was not done yet, and he was -- those two brothers were also on the death march which was to Dachau for the execution.</span> <span id="s837">And when they were captured by the Americans they said, "We know somebody in __________ and they brought -- and they brought you.</span> <span id="s838">And they came to us.</span> <span id="s839">And like so many others --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q.</span> <span id="s841">So that was the first time --</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A.</span> <span id="s843">That was the first time I met --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q.

Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q.</span> <span id="s852">But a part of history we can work from.</span> <span id="s853">So we want to present it from that standpoint.</span> <span id="s854">Thank you both very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A. You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A. Ja, she was still thanking Jehovah for it, celebrate one day after that when you were like completely upon Jehovah.</span> <span id="s857">That's why we thought unless Armageddon comes we would never come out of.</span> <span id="s858">We know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q. So, you were in with Jewish prisoners, with Communist prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A. Not Jewish.</span> <span id="s861">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s862">A couple came, was transferred because they had a court case.</span> <span id="s863">And they said in Mauthausen on the Austrian border, there is an unwritten law a Jew did not live longer than six days.</span> <span id="s864">They put them in a basket with those, you know, pieces of -- well, you use the planer, you know, the shovels.</span> <span id="s865">They put them in a basket and throw gasoline is what they told me.</span> <span id="s866">Maybe they don't have to bring that -- you know, some Jews might be offended.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q. Those things actually happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A. Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q. You're very familiar with that.</span> <span id="s870">So what type of prisoners were in --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A. Intelligence.</span> <span id="s872">For instance, one he was so smart in falsifying passports he offered me, "I will make you a passport and you can do everything with it."</span> <span id="s873">And he was -- actually he said, "There is no safe that is safe before me.</span> <span id="s874">Fifteen minutes I can open any safe."</span> <span id="s875">Do you know what happened?</span> <span id="s876">The Gestapo got him.</span> <span id="s877">They used him because see, they wouldn't use you, you know.</span> <span id="s878">They use such hardcore criminals.</span> <span id="s879">They can do everything with a man.</span> <span id="s880">For instance, the one who threw me this New Testament, you know, the Greek scriptures, you know, the camp leader ask him, "you know, guard, would you -- I need for my cooking pot and I need brasso copper."</span> <span id="s881">How do you say plate at the bottom, you know?</span> <span id="s882">And then he said, "But where shall I get the copper plate?</span> <span id="s883">It's not in the releases."</span> <span id="s884">"I didn't ask you where it is," it was an electrician there, you know.</span> <span id="s885">But he said, "If I don't have it tomorrow you're off your job."</span> <span id="s886">So he said, in other words, he asked me to steal it, to break in, the camp leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q. Hum.</span> <span id="s888">How were the Communists treated in the camp you were in or in any of the camps you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A. Actually they were treated all the same, you know, uh-huh (indicates affirmatively.)</span> <span id="s890">But I -- it's actually got worth getting in.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q.</span> <span id="s892">How were you able to talk to the other prisoners as well, or didn't you have time for that, about your particular faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A. Oh ja, sure.</span> <span id="s894">You could talk; ja.</span> <span id="s895">There is one occasion as I mentioned before we were six brothers so we could do the job, you know, because we were cooperating with each other.</span> <span id="s896">And there was one, you know, those showmanship notices and so on.</span> <span id="s897">We helped him because he would never finish.</span> <span id="s898">And, you know, one day he would scream, "Jehovah's Witnesses doing propaganda," and foaming in his mouth and said be quiet and all this, you see it completely dominized.</span> <span id="s899">We were helping him and then he turned out you see how the demon work.</span> <span id="s900">I saw in the camp how.</span> <span id="s901">Before I didn't realize how the demons work.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q. Hum.</span> <span id="s903">What was an average day in the camp that you were in like?</span> <span id="s904">What time did it start?</span> <span id="s905">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s906">What happened during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A. Began 6:00 to work.</span> <span id="s908">There was I would say carts where we were put on, you know.</span> <span id="s909">And then -- and this wasn't at the time when we got up.</span> <span id="s910">It was criminals that were in charge, you know.</span> <span id="s911">They would throw us out 4:00 or even before screaming all the time, in the beds and all, you know.</span> <span id="s912">They were fully in charge of everything.</span> <span id="s913">When we came from work it was the same with them.</span> <span id="s914">They had all the power and could do whatever they want.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q.</span> <span id="s916">So you got up before 6:00?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A. 4:00, not later.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q. And how much did you get in the way of food?</span> <span id="s919">How many times a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A.</span> <span id="s921">In the morning there was, was slice of bread and the black coffee.</span> <span id="s922">And then they would _____________ already when the apple, you know, and they checked where he has in his sack the slice of bread and says, "No wonder he pass out.</span> <span id="s923">He was over eating."</span> <span id="s924">They were beating him.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q. And then you only ate one time a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s927">This was the breakfast one slice of bread.</span> <span id="s928">And you had to spare it, you know.</span> <span id="s929">And in the evening when you kept it you only got soup, one slice of bread sometime.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q.</span> <span id="s931">So what time did you work until in the evening?</span> <span id="s932">What was your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A. Before it got dark because then they were scared of -- if one escaped you got to stand there until they got the one.</span> <span id="s934">They would beat him, you know.</span> <span id="s935">Sometimes how they in the mood, you know, one they would beat all the way unless it was gone, you know.</span> <span id="s936">And then another one they would say, "You __________, " and see this one treated him like a hero.</span> <span id="s937">Just what mood they were in.</span> <span id="s938">But this was when one escaped you stood and you would stand one day and then they would charge the dogs and all them, you know.</span> <span id="s939">And then they finished him off.</span> <span id="s940">But we were mistreated because of the one too.</span> <span id="s941">And then the so-called holiday time, Christmas time they were drunk and made all the things, nighttime out on the Lausenstrausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q.</span> <span id="s943">You know while they were doing these things they still celebrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A. Ja, sure.</span> <span id="s945">They celebrate, ja,</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q.</span> <span id="s947">So then what would you say that -- what was it that was able to keep you alive during all these years of mistreatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A. Only complete reliance upon Jehovah.</span> <span id="s949">And that's when for instance the power says persistence in prayer; ja.</span> <span id="s950">It's actually I would feel one of the strongest suit of armor parts.</span> <span id="s951">Without Jehovah's help, without prayer we cannot stand.</span> <span id="s952">I recall one day there was a situation -- we don't have time.</span> <span id="s953">The _______.</span> <span id="s954">And I say, "Please, Jehovah, don't let me die as a coward.</span> <span id="s955">I don't want to __________ on your holy name."</span> <span id="s956">You prayed, you know, when you feel that's it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q.</span> <span id="s958">So when the war was over and you were released where did you go to after you -- I need a little bit of your help.</span> <span id="s959">What did you begin doing after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s961">So our ______________ brought a -- visited us, you know, and said, "Josef, it's going on already," you know.</span> <span id="s962">And then there was a service meeting and he said, "Josef, you go tomorrow to ______________ deliver talk, public discourse.</span> <span id="s963">And I said, "What kind of discourse?"</span> <span id="s964">He said no, it was this brochure, protectional destruction.</span> <span id="s965">And then I said, "When do I have to go?"</span> <span id="s966">He said, "After the meeting tonight you take off so you will get there the next day."</span> <span id="s967">Ragensport was the capital of upper Bavaria.</span> <span id="s968">And then so I take the train.</span> <span id="s969">Then when I came there the next day in the evening asked this brother in charge, I said -- Vagasa was his name -- he actually said to me, asked me, "Josef what you're talking about?"</span> <span id="s970">He said protection and destruction, that that what my __________ I give the last week, he says.</span> <span id="s971">So I had to collect myself and then find something but we had other ____________ so I could take advantage of this then we had before ___________ I could even read some of this, you know, to be lost.</span> <span id="s972">But to have a great audience with when there are one hundred fifty people that you can bring something that makes sense, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q. So, in other words, you became engaged again in your Bible educational work just as soon as the war ended and continued on?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A. Ja, uh-huh (indicates affirmatively).</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q. And when did you marry then your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A.</span> <span id="s977">It was here in 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q.

Uh-huh (indicates affirmatively.)</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q.</span> <span id="s981">So what did you do from 1948 until you married your wife in 1958?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s983">I was an assistant in congressional, the Watch Tower, serving there was the school servant.</span> <span id="s984">And then I was -- in other words, for the congregation on the _____________ send me to another congregation which was fifty kilometers up in the mountains, you know, didn't do so well.</span> <span id="s985">So I was the presiding overseer there at the time the congregation suffered to call and I help them to --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q.</span> <span id="s987">How long did it take for your health to be restored you because you were -- you were in quite bad shape you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A. Ja.</span> <span id="s989">I had two holes in my lung and physically I didn't realize it was, but I was wondering.</span> <span id="s990">And then I was in a sanatorium six months and they wanted to operate but I didn't agree on this.</span> <span id="s991">And then actually I was living a very simple life and cured myself with cold water treatments, several things, in jumping glacial river between the floating ice, you know, and then I went to bed.</span> <span id="s992">And so _____________ and you try everything, you know.</span> <span id="s993">And finally the one that the health department took x-rays and it was wondering they asked Mitsy, you know, ask her did Josef go to this miracle doctor," because he couldn't figure out anywhere what's going on that I got so well.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q.
