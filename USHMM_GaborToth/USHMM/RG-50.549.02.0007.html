one, two, testing.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: How about just tell me – introduce yourself and tell us where you’ll – where we are.</span> <span id="s22">Tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Ah, my name is Michael Vogel.</span> <span id="s24">I’m being interviewed by the Holocaust Museum of Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s25">We are at our home at 6531 Sunset Lane, Indianapolis, Indiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: All right, that’ll work.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Is – am I coming through?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: You’re coming through fine.</span> <span id="s29">The one thing I’m going to do is just tilt this slightly.</span> <span id="s30">There we go.</span> <span id="s31">What they’ve asked me to do is before we get started talking about your life since coming to the U.S. is – there are a f – there were a few gaps in the video interview that you did almost 10 years ago, and there were a – a short list of things that they wanted me to ask about, to clarify certain –</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: The spelling and stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Well, that separately, you got that list.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: That – that’s something we can do at the end of the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: But there were a couple of specific things that they wanted me to ask you that pertained to details regarding stories that you told before.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: So, I’d like to start with those and then move into your life since the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: In your previous interview you mentioned that on the – the march from Landsberg –</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Landsberg.</span> <span id="s44">That several guards asked the prisoners to quote, sign that I was good to you, that I gave you bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: What did they mean?</span> <span id="s47">What were they expecting of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, I’ve seen it, I’ve seen the paper, I’ve seen the paper in their hand.</span> <span id="s49">These were actually Wehrmacht guards by now, so most of the SS guards ran away.</span> <span id="s50">But as we were marching with these Wehrmacht guards, from the lans – last concentration camp, which was a subcamp of Dachau, Landsberg, we were supposedly marching towards the Tyrolean mountains, and they knew the ne – end was near.</span> <span id="s51">Of course we – we had – we had to push a wagon behind us so if anybody fell, that was just throw ‘em in the wagon, so nobody was – be left on the road.</span> <span id="s52">And this piece of pa – they wrote these pieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, on the edge as they were marching.</span> <span id="s53">Here, would you mind – would you sign this for me, and tell them that I was good to you, that I helped you, that I gave you some food.</span> <span id="s54">Some people did sign.</span> <span id="s55">I’ve seen some people sign.</span> <span id="s56">Wha-Wha-What – what could a poor – poor soul do?</span> <span id="s57">In the – they never came to me personally, but I’ve seen them being done.</span> <span id="s58">So this was the death march, so to speak a death march because lot of people were – were falling like flies.</span> <span id="s59">I was one of the fortunate ones, I was still strong enough because of – of the slave labor that I performed prior to that, of eating a little better.</span> <span id="s60">So, during this death march there was also a American Air Force air raid on a munition depot very close to a town called Würzburg, Germany.</span> <span id="s61">And from there as the – th – as the Americans were bombing, I ran and I successfully escaped.</span> <span id="s62">And soon after I was picked up by the United States Armed Forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Th-Th-The questions I’m going to ask you in the next few minutes are very disparate, they’re – they’re – they’re not in chronology necessarily, but they’re, again, picking up on things that you mentioned before.</span> <span id="s64">Did you ever get over your fear of doctors and dentists?</span> <span id="s65">You referred to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Unfortunately not.</span> <span id="s67">I – from day – from – ever since I’ve been out of the – the death camps, concentration camps – when I met my wife, I got married, I had – I had problem with my teeth.</span> <span id="s68">You know, there – there is saying, your teeth are alright, but your gums have to come out, and that was my case, and I was deathly afraid.</span> <span id="s69">Once – I once ran away from a dentist in the army.</span> <span id="s70">I don’t know if I ever s – mentioned that to – to – to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s71">I was taken by another – another G.I. with – to – to go to the dentist because I had awful ba-bad teeth and pain.</span> <span id="s72">And I was sitting in the chair and I ran away from there.</span> <span id="s73">I’m still scared of dentists, I’m still deathly afraid of shots.</span> <span id="s74">I’ll tell you an – a little story about what happened to me a few years ago.</span> <span id="s75">As I mentioned to you before, I wa – I was involved in soccer, not only as a coach and a referee, but as a player.</span> <span id="s76">I was playing a soccer game and I got hit by a man and he opened my f – my forehead.</span> <span id="s77">I ended up in a hospital.</span> <span id="s78">And a friend of mine, the one I showed you on the picture in – in the wall there, took me to the hospital and then they called my wife to come to the hospital.</span> <span id="s79">They wanted to give me a tetanus shot.</span> <span id="s80">I would re – I refused it, I would – I fought it.</span> <span id="s81">My wife almost left me because of that, she was so upset with me.</span> <span id="s82">That tetanus shot was so important because I was hit, and also hit a door, and the hor – door had a little steel [indecipherable] I was – and doctors fear is still there.</span> <span id="s83">When I go to examination, I am awfully fearful what they going to do to you.</span> <span id="s84">Very much so, even today.</span> <span id="s85">I’m afraid of when they look for po – prostrate, you know, when they do th – do that little finger job on you.</span> <span id="s86">That scares me, that scares the hell out of me.</span> <span id="s87">When they take a little blood from the fingers, that scares me.</span> <span id="s88">So that fear is from Auschwitz, unfortunately, because I’ve seen Mengele e-e-every day on th – on – on the tracks.</span> <span id="s89">So the doctors always scare me, and they shouldn’t, they really shouldn’t, not today.</span> <span id="s90">And especially since I have a daughter who is a physician.</span> <span id="s91">But I’m still afra – a-afraid of it.</span> <span id="s92">I’m very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Have you ever made any efforts to do anything about that?</span> <span id="s94">Have you –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: N-No.</span> <span id="s96">See, there are two things that I am afraid of.</span> <span id="s97">Doctors and dentists is two, and I’m also afraid of water.</span> <span id="s98">Water scares me for the simple reason because in Auschwitz, I was sent to a shtraf(ph) commander once.</span> <span id="s99">Shtraf(ph) commander meaning that they caught me es – organizing food for Jewish girls [indecipherable] commando, and they send you to a sin o-o-operation, so they call it shtraf(ph).</span> <span id="s100">Sin – sin – sin commando, which meant that we were forced to cut seaweeds in water.</span> <span id="s101">We had a chain – chainsaw like, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one the other end, gonna pull it, was like a sickle, which would cut it.</span> <span id="s102">And there would be a kapo(ph) – a – a [indecipherable], a kapo(ph), a – a person who was in charge of us behind us with the SS man, and they would dunk our heads in the water and kept us there until we could not breathe any more.</span> <span id="s103">So I – I – I went through that for a couple of weeks as a – a-a-as a shtraf commander, as a sin [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s104">So whenever – whenever we go to a beach or something, I only go up to my knees.</span> <span id="s105">And not one of my children, of the four kids, were swimmers, because of me.</span> <span id="s106">And of course, now they are learning a little bit.</span> <span id="s107">Some of them are – a couple of them are still afraid.</span> <span id="s108">Arsani’s(ph) a swimmer now, his ti – his children are a swimmer.</span> <span id="s109">Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was always deathly afraid of water, because of the – because of me.</span> <span id="s110">So those are the things that scare me, scare the hell out of me, doctors, dentists and water.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Makes sense.</span> <span id="s112">I’m gonna re-rearrange the microphone so it’s a little less bothersome for you and you can move around better.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Can you –</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: It’s fine, it’s -- that just gives you a little more free reign.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Although it’s off s – the chronology a little bit here, I would like t – well, I’ll come back to this, th-the – how you think – what you – how you think your children have been affected by what happened to you is something I would like to talk to you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Do you – you want to talk to me about it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: All right, we’re there, so let’s – let’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: All right, let’s – the children, our children.</span> <span id="s122">Well, when I arrived to this country, May 10th, 1946, I came from the army, so it was a little different for me than the most survivors that arrived here, because most survivors came on a diff – in a – i-in a – in a different way.</span> <span id="s123">I was helped with the United States armed forces and also was very helpful that I had an aunt living in Detroit.</span> <span id="s124">So when I first met my wife, my future wife, we started dating, we – also a survivor, you know.</span> <span id="s125">She didn't have much family, I didn’t have any family, so you lonely, I’m lonely, let’s be lonely together, the old saying what is the – one survivor said it at one time, if I may use his phrase.</span> <span id="s126">So when we got married, February 22nd, 1948, it will be 50 years coming up in the next – th-this February, I asked my wife, why don’t we – let’s not talk any more any other language except English.</span> <span id="s127">My English was fairly decent except I had the ar-army language, which was not the cleanest language in those days, of course.</span> <span id="s128">That’s how I learned.</span> <span id="s129">And we decided – she was a little bit against it.</span> <span id="s130">She said no, we should talk to the children other languages also.</span> <span id="s131">She was much smarter than me, believe me, because the kids today could have – although they speak some languages, but they could – today they could have learned much more.</span> <span id="s132">So, how did it affect my children?</span> <span id="s133">First, we wouldn’t talk about our experiences.</span> <span id="s134">Another mistake we made – I made, anyway, it was – I’m – I’m taking the blame for that.</span> <span id="s135">Reason we didn’t want to, why hurt them?</span> <span id="s136">Why let them know how much we suffered, how much we went through?</span> <span id="s137">But the kids knew they were different.</span> <span id="s138">Our children soon, as soon as they started school found out they were different.</span> <span id="s139">Number one, they didn’t have any first cousins.</span> <span id="s140">They didn’t have any aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s141">No grandparents.</span> <span id="s142">There was never a grandmother to – to – to hug them and kiss them or whatever.</span> <span id="s143">School functions, for parent and grandparents, there were never any grandparents around.</span> <span id="s144">We used to adopt grandparents for them.</span> <span id="s145">In Detroit we use to a-adopt a lady in the apartment building.</span> <span id="s146">She was nice, and th – Grandma Goldstein, that was her grandma.</span> <span id="s147">She did – she had one daughter, an old, old maid, never married, so our children became her grandchildren.</span> <span id="s148">So the kids were – knew they – and yet they knew, they knew why something was wrong, but we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s149">The only time the kids would – our son was the first one, who was the oldest.</span> <span id="s150">When I joined this soccer team in Detroit, which by the way was founded by German Jews who arrived to United States in the 30’s, just before Hitler got to them.</span> <span id="s151">And I joined this team and pretty soon – there was a tryout – pretty soon there were more survivors joining this team.</span> <span id="s152">So after soccer games we would go to someone’s home, yours, mine or someone else’s and had a cookout or dinner, or whatever.</span> <span id="s153">We would start talking about the game, then we would start talking about our lives in America, how – how are we doing, how much money do you make.</span> <span id="s154">And before you knew it, Auschwitz would come to the – to – into the – into the conversation.</span> <span id="s155">And our children, especially our son, would always listen from be – from behind the door.</span> <span id="s156">And – and he knew – he – then he would tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something about Daddy, or I heard something about Mom, about what ha – what happened to them in the camps.</span> <span id="s157">So we didn’t want to talk about these experiences to them.</span> <span id="s158">And ar – then, let me tell you about the – the – the – the local Jewish population.</span> <span id="s159">Detroit is a big metropolitan city with a large Jewish population.</span> <span id="s160">We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes went to a school to learn English.</span> <span id="s161">I – at the Jewish Community Center in Detroit, and our soccer team will also meet there.</span> <span id="s162">So, I didn’t go to that school because I – I – I – I felt I – I had enough of schooling, which was another mistake.</span> <span id="s163">Would have listened to my wife I probably would have been sometime a teacher today somewhere.</span> <span id="s164">So we – then we tried to tell the local population, the local Jewish population, our – our own people in – in the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s165">We had a Purim play, we went to a Purim play, and then all of a sudden we start talking to these people about Auschwitz, no – number of us in the soccer team.</span> <span id="s166">And the leader of the group says, that’s enough about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s167">Let’s go back to singing and playing the music again.</span> <span id="s168">So nobody want to listen.</span> <span id="s169">My own aunt, may she rest in peace, my father’s youngest sister, who lost everybody in her family, she lost two sisters, she lost her brother, she lost all her nieces and nephews and – and – and – and all her cousins, she wouldn’t – she, coming in 1939, emigrating to this country in 1939 from Vienna, Austria, she didn’t want to listen.</span> <span id="s170">So we decided not to talk about it.</span> <span id="s171">The first time I was able to talk about it was when our youngest daughter asked my wife to come to her eighth grade junior high school to speak, and the next day my wife forced me to go there.</span> <span id="s172">Yet, I didn’t tell them a story like the story should be told.</span> <span id="s173">I kind of whitewashed it.</span> <span id="s174">I was afraid to hurt people.</span> <span id="s175">So that took a long time.</span> <span id="s176">So my children, at f – at first they were resentful, they said Daddy, why didn’t you tell us?</span> <span id="s177">Why – you know, th – they didn’t come and – and say to me, you – you – you were wrong, you – you should have done it.</span> <span id="s178">But you could have told us.</span> <span id="s179">I didn’t want to hurt you honey.</span> <span id="s180">This – this is simple, it’s a – it the o – it’s the way it is, I’d – it just – I don’t want to hurt strangers, let alone my own children.</span> <span id="s181">So they’re different.</span> <span id="s182">But today they’re very much involved.</span> <span id="s183">My daughter, the oldest one, the physician was on the Holocaust Committee with me, which I am a chairman of [indecipherable] local – local Holocaust Committee called Jewish Committee Relations.</span> <span id="s184">Both – all three of the daughters went to second generation meetings, second generation of Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s185">In ninete – January 27, 1985, I took two of my children, my son and my middle daughter, the New Yorker, the jeweler, with me to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Auschwitz being liberated, if you can call being liberated by the Soviet Union a liberation.</span> <span id="s186">And they came there.</span> <span id="s187">I showed them, first of all Auschwitz number one, that was the first camp that I was taken to.</span> <span id="s188">I showed them the barrack that my father was last taken to, block seven in Auschwitz, called the Krankenbau, the sick bay.</span> <span id="s189">Sick bay without doctors.</span> <span id="s190">I showed them that barrack.</span> <span id="s191">This is where they took my – your grandfather last time, to the ovens from.</span> <span id="s192">I showed them block 16 where I s – where I was living on the – which by the way, block 16 today in Auschwitz is the Czechoslovakian block, a-a-and they have some artifacts in there.</span> <span id="s193">And we spend there a couple da – two days in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s194">And then of course in 1990, I went back again to Auschwitz, but this time I took agn – took Agnes with me, the same middle daughter and the youngest daughter.</span> <span id="s195">This is where we made a film called, “Auschwitz, If You Cried, You Died.”</span> <span id="s196">So I sh – there I really pored my heart out to my children, to show them what Auschwitz is all about, what it was all about.</span> <span id="s197">I took them to every – see I was working as a slave laborer, a place called Kanada commando, unloading incoming Jews from every – every Nazi occupied European country.</span> <span id="s198">And this is where I gave my two daughters and my wife, who has not been to Auschwitz, their exact feeling what Auschwitz was about.</span> <span id="s199">I explained to them crematorium one – crematorium one, which is in Auschwitz number one, which is still standing.</span> <span id="s200">Then we went to Birkenau, which is the Auschwitz number two camp, and I showed them the crematorias(ph).</span> <span id="s201">I worked as a slave laborer at Birkenau, 600 yards from the gas chambers and crematorias(ph).</span> <span id="s202">So the kids today know much more than they should have known years ago, which I was afraid to tell them, to hurt them.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What ways – so much to talk about at th – I’m – I’m – I’m trying to think in terms of doing this in a – in an order that would be useful to future people listening to this, but other ways your children were affected, you – you talk about that they have, in a second hand fashion abs – absorbed some of your fears.</span> <span id="s204">Have – is that something that you’ve ever talked to them about over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: About my fears?</span> <span id="s206">Well, the kids were always afraid that they would hurt me i-if they would talk to me about my fears because you know, it’s bad enough that I had it, you know?</span> <span id="s207">My son tried a number of times, he says, Dad, you know, you can go to water.</span> <span id="s208">You can swim with the – look at your grandchildren, look at your little granddaughter, she dives from this big diving board.</span> <span id="s209">He says, you don’t have to dive, but you can go in the water deeper than you go into water.</span> <span id="s210">They tried it, but I – I – I-I – i – we were in Israel, we just got back from Israel last week.</span> <span id="s211">We went to the swimming pool.</span> <span id="s212">There were kids playing with a ball, I was playing soccer with them, you know, in a group.</span> <span id="s213">I didn’t want to go in that water.</span> <span id="s214">I went.</span> <span id="s215">Little – little above my knees, and anything that – a-as soon as I feel the water above, I get scared, still to this day.</span> <span id="s216">So the fears, well, the kids tried, but s – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Have you ever done anything – I don’t want to dwell on this too much, but in terms of your – your fear of doctors and dentists, have you – you know, there are certain dentists, for example, who specialize in people who are phobic about dentistry, and who, you know, are particularly sensitive to that, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: The only way any dentist could touch my teeth, or es – extract them, have to put me to sleep.</span> <span id="s219">That’s – I – no other way I would have done it.</span> <span id="s220">Yet, when I lost all these teeth – of course, I – when I got out of Auschwitz I had hardly any teeth left, but when I lost the rest of them, this guy, this dentist was very gentle, whom I still have – course, now I don’t need him, I only got thr-three teeth left.</span> <span id="s221">But even then, he knows how sensitive I am.</span> <span id="s222">When he cleans the remaining on my teeth, he makes sure that I get enough Novocain into me that I don’t feel not even his – I don’t even feel his finger.</span> <span id="s223">My lips and mouth is frozen for a whole day after that.</span> <span id="s224">So I – i-i-I – I don’t know, I don’t think I would want to be the doctor that I should be his patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Out of curiosity, I know you’ve – again, we’re jumping ahead, I know that you’ve had a lot of contact with other survivors in the past decade or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Are – do you share common fears along those lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: There are some of us that have the same fears, and especially those of us who – unfortunately two of them are – two of them died in the recent years – those of us who spent in Auschwitz more than two years, because we didn’t live through because of doctors, because the doctors were there to kill you.</span> <span id="s229">But they had the same fears.</span> <span id="s230">I have one friend who died in Skokie al – two years ago, Joe Neumann(ph).</span> <span id="s231">You – you mentioned his name [indecipherable] misspelled it anyway, but Joe was the same as me.</span> <span id="s232">He had – unfortunately, he died of an aneurism and – and a heart problem two years ago.</span> <span id="s233">He was the strongest prisoner ever, among us.</span> <span id="s234">He was seven years – se-seven, eight years older than me and he looked like a real -- a real born Nazi.</span> <span id="s235">He had blonde, blue eyed – blonde hair, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s236">And Mengele liked him so much that he never believed he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">He never – he always told him, Du bist kein Jude nicht – you’re not a Jew.</span> <span id="s238">You – you are – you are a German.</span> <span id="s239">And he spoke pretty – pretty good German, too.</span> <span id="s240">We all did from Slovakia, you know.</span> <span id="s241">So we – we – and the other guy in f – in his hist – he was historian, his name was Eric Kulka.</span> <span id="s242">Eric Kulka was a – wr-wrote a number of books.</span> <span id="s243">In fact, he wrote the first book, him and another guy in pra – li – who lives in Prague, his name is Ota Kraus, they wrote the book called, “The Death Factory.”</span> <span id="s244">Started in 1947, you can imagine, not even two years after Auschwitz, they started this book.</span> <span id="s245">And I happen to have a copy of it also, but it – that book was printed in many, many languages.</span> <span id="s246">And this guy Kulka, he too had fears of doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: We’ve seen what doctors did to our – in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s249">We knew when someone was pulled from – from – from the bunk and being castrated by Mengele, or give him the – the injection, the shots, th-the – the penal what do you call it?</span> <span id="s250">The – the – the shot that kills you that th-they use in the pri – in prisons when the death sentence fe – then th – so they give you shots to kill you for – from a death row.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: I don’t know what chemical that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Phenyl – penal – some kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s253">Well, I – I can’t think of the name now, I’m sure it’ll come to me.</span> <span id="s254">And these were the shots that were given in Germany, in – in the – in – in – in the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: What about other fears, general fears?</span> <span id="s256">When you – when you were here, when – when the war was over, when you were – I don’t know when we want to start talking about this, but you must – I’m assuming you had some other fears, fears of –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Well, let me just – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: – of the police, fears of –</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Well le-let me – let me start with the fears.</span> <span id="s260">When I was first picked up in United States Armed Forces, number one I didn’t speak any – speak English.</span> <span id="s261">I spoke German, I spoke Hungarian, I spoke Russian, I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s262">And the only reason I got along with the army, because there was some people that were born in this country of Polish parents, of Czech parents, of Slovak parents and then I could communicate with them.</span> <span id="s263">And there was a guy from Boston, of all places, and – a Jewish fellow by the name of Feldman, he was a schoolteacher.</span> <span id="s264">And he would teach me English, how did he teach me English?</span> <span id="s265">By making me read “Stars and Stripes” and also the army sent me to a school in – in Germany, in occupied Germany, I and E school.</span> <span id="s266">Information education.</span> <span id="s267">Who was this school for?</span> <span id="s268">This school war – was not for people to – to learn English, this was people from – from the illiterates.</span> <span id="s269">People from the south – and I’m sorry not – I hope that nobody who listens to me, I don’t think everybody in the south doesn’t know how to read.</span> <span id="s270">But these were guys who didn’t go to schools.</span> <span id="s271">And they had to write home letters from the armed forces.</span> <span id="s272">It was – they – they knew how to carry a gun and shoot it, but they had problem reading or writing.</span> <span id="s273">So the ar – Feldman was teaching this class called I and E, information education.</span> <span id="s274">And there would be a blackboard and on this blackboard there would be a letter.</span> <span id="s275">Dear folks, today I am in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s276">I am fine, hope you are too.</span> <span id="s277">Love, your son John.</span> <span id="s278">And I would l-learn how to read and write that way, plus this Feldman made me read “Stars and Stripes.”</span> <span id="s279">And he would teach me English.</span> <span id="s280">I have a knack for languages and I learned the language quite – quite qu-quickly in th – the American language, as well as other languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: We were talking about fears –</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: – and how you dealt with them over the years –</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Ah – oh – okay –</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: – other types of fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: All right, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Well, I got you – I got you this one.</span> <span id="s289">Now, fears in the army.</span> <span id="s290">I had fears in the army.</span> <span id="s291">Any time I’ve seen soldiers march, I’ve always looked back to see who was behind me.</span> <span id="s292">Those were the other fears.</span> <span id="s293">There was a Red Cross field director who had a woman working for him, woman Red Cross, also a field dire – field person.</span> <span id="s294">She was from Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s295">Her name was Wanda Waleiko(ph) Wanda Waleiko(ph) was like a psychia – psych-psychologist and she was in charge of me.</span> <span id="s296">She would always talk to me, try to get me back into – the ar – of course, in those days you didn’t have psychiatrists like you have today.</span> <span id="s297">And she would try to talk to me and calm me down, and – and – and she was the one who tried to get the fear away from me, because she – they knew – soon I – when I ran away from the dentist they knew that something is wrong with me, that th – something has to be done.</span> <span id="s298">And I remember they gave me a capsule to take to calm me down.</span> <span id="s299">And I don’t know how to take this capsule.</span> <span id="s300">So what I’ve done, I opened the capsule and I put the powder in my hand from the ca – th-the contents into – and it was awfully bitter and that’s what I took.</span> <span id="s301">I didn’t know that you can take the capsule and just swallow it and it dissolves.</span> <span id="s302">Who knew that, you know, from where?</span> <span id="s303">So, fears?</span> <span id="s304">Then I came to this country, I had fears here.</span> <span id="s305">I had awful fears here.</span> <span id="s306">I was afraid of policemen.</span> <span id="s307">I was afraid of anything that – that had authority over me.</span> <span id="s308">See, I had my first job in this country in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s309">And my uncle, who was my – my – my aunt’s husband, he was a c p – accountant, C.P.A. And he would help me, reading the Detroit News and Detroit’s Free Press to – in the a – want ads.</span> <span id="s310">And there was an ad in the paper, foreign speaking salesman wanted.</span> <span id="s311">So my uncle put me on a streetcar, and I went there.</span> <span id="s312">That’s how I got my first job.</span> <span id="s313">And first job was working in the – in the store, Zolcara(ph) department stores in Detroit Michigan on Jefferson Avenue.</span> <span id="s314">And the store – we would sell merchandise to foreign people, Americans that were – came from a foreign country.</span> <span id="s315">That would – now, war is over, they had relatives in Europe, in Poland, in Hungary and wherever.</span> <span id="s316">They would receive letters from – from their relatives and we would read the letters and they said, Anna needs a pair of pants, John needs a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s317">Here is a piece of string, this is the size of his foot.</span> <span id="s318">Here’s a piece of string, this is size of his waist, for pants.</span> <span id="s319">And that – so that’s what we used to do, that’s how – that’s – that ma – was my first job.</span> <span id="s320">Then I wa – started to lose a little f – little – little fear already, but I was still, if I can say it in those words, I didn’t have the trust, the faith.</span> <span id="s321">I’d a – I was always a – always afraid that – that – th-that it’s too good, you know, that it can’t be, th-th-that’s – you know.</span> <span id="s322">I always look behind, who is behind me.</span> <span id="s323">And it took me a long time.</span> <span id="s324">Took me a very long time, took me a very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: How long?</span> <span id="s326">Years, decades?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I would say it took years, years.</span> <span id="s328">Five, six years or better.</span> <span id="s329">When I met my wife, and we started getting the children, even then I was always fearful, always very fearful about my kids.</span> <span id="s330">It shouldn’t happen to them what happened to the kids in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s331">So it took a long time.</span> <span id="s332">And the nightmares, you know, they were there for a long time, and – and let me tell you, even to this date, they don’t stop.</span> <span id="s333">You know when they come the strongest on?</span> <span id="s334">Let’s say I’m invited to speak at a university or a high school or college or civic or – or religious organization.</span> <span id="s335">And while I’m speaking, I’m fine.</span> <span id="s336">Now the questions come, and the questions bring back – bring out more than actual presentation because – see it – while I’m speaking, I don’t use any text.</span> <span id="s337">I never, never, never use a piece of paper when I speak.</span> <span id="s338">I – I can’t stand reading my life story at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s339">But when I’m speaking, I’m reliving my time in Auschwitz, my time in Sachsenhausen, my time in Landsberg and so on.</span> <span id="s340">And I – then I gotta – and it’s all there in front of you.</span> <span id="s341">Now you see yourself, you actually see in your own visual mind, you see the days that you unloaded, the days that the selections are made at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s342">So you see all that, you know.</span> <span id="s343">So you live that – you relive that.</span> <span id="s344">Now I’m finished the presentation.</span> <span id="s345">I’m driving home from 60, 70, sometime 100 miles out of the state, sometimes be different states.</span> <span id="s346">And as I go home I’m – now I’m trying to calm myself down.</span> <span id="s347">I go to bed at night and I get nightmares.</span> <span id="s348">You know that – never a day goes by that Auschwitz doesn’t come ba – come in your head.</span> <span id="s349">And it isn’t because they tattoo a number on my arm.</span> <span id="s350">That is, you know, here I am.</span> <span id="s351">The same way with my children as they got older.</span> <span id="s352">I tried to tell them a little more about it, you know, and then – now they’re in college.</span> <span id="s353">You worry about them away from home.</span> <span id="s354">Then they come home with boyfriends.</span> <span id="s355">You know, from the – from the – from the day they were born, when there was bris, when there was a circumcision, people are there, my a – my aunt, my wife’s uncle is the godfather, and you’re looking for people to come to your – there.</span> <span id="s356">I’m looking for the people that never show up.</span> <span id="s357">I’m looking the people that I wanted to be there, they’re not there.</span> <span id="s358">Our ya – oldest daughter got engaged.</span> <span id="s359">Young man came to ask for her hand.</span> <span id="s360">And I – I broke down something terrible.</span> <span id="s361">Broke down something terrible, from happiness and sadness.</span> <span id="s362">Here I’ve got a daughter who is ready to get married.</span> <span id="s363">She will never see her grandmother, never see her cousins, never see anyone else at her wedding, you know.</span> <span id="s364">And then, when there is happiness and sadness, who do you share it with?</span> <span id="s365">Just with the immediate family.</span> <span id="s366">Your wife and your children.</span> <span id="s367">And your children try to calm you down, they try to come to you and, you know.</span> <span id="s368">And I feel very sad about those things, you know.</span> <span id="s369">Now our little daughter in Switzerland is gonna make us grandparents, okay?</span> <span id="s370">So here she is, 4,000 miles away from us.</span> <span id="s371">And my wife and I, we insist we’re going to be there when the kid is born but how do we – how do you figure that out?</span> <span id="s372">Yeah, so – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: When you were there in the army camp after the liberation, did they understand what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: When I first got picked up by the United States Armed Forces, called 774 tank battalion, this was before the camps were even near.</span> <span id="s375">They were – this was quite a ways from any camp, away from Dachau.</span> <span id="s376">And when I showed them this number, when I told them what it’s all about, this Polish American from Chicago brings over his captain, his name was Captain Yogerling(ph), and he brings him over who is a – who was an attorney from home.</span> <span id="s377">And he’s try – he’s telling him what I tell him in Polish what happened.</span> <span id="s378">They were sh-shrugging their shoulder.</span> <span id="s379">They had no idea what I – wh-what I – what I came from.</span> <span id="s380">They seen a guy who – who weighed nothing, like me, I was a – a skinny skeleton runt.</span> <span id="s381">And they tried to feed – first of all they cleaned me up from head to toe, they had the – they had these traveling showers, what the army shower had carried around, they were wide open and they had water, and they had a little shower head and then they gave you soap and DDT powder to spray you.</span> <span id="s382">And then they gave me clean uniform, clean fatigue, clean pair of boots.</span> <span id="s383">First time I had underwear on in almost three years, an-and socks and pair of – pair of army boots.</span> <span id="s384">And tried to tell them, they knew nothing until they hit the first concentration camp.</span> <span id="s385">And even then they didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s386">They’re seeing this mass of bodies coming out of cattle cars, gotta – or coming out of – just walking over dead people.</span> <span id="s387">They couldn’t understand how could anybody do this to anybody.</span> <span id="s388">And then I start to tell them.</span> <span id="s389">See, this is what happened in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s390">This is what happened in the camps, in the Nazi death camps.</span> <span id="s391">And then, of course, they started, you know, being rowdy on the streets.</span> <span id="s392">Every time they seen a German on the bicycle they kicked him off, took his bicycle.</span> <span id="s393">They did all sorts of things just to – they want to beat up every German they’ve seen on the street.</span> <span id="s394">Of course the – the officers stopped them because he – you – you don’t – America you don’t – you don’t do these things in America, you don’t do these things in war.</span> <span id="s395">So they di – really didn’t know, didn’t have the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s396">And they didn’t know how to treat us.</span> <span id="s397">What they would do?</span> <span id="s398">Every American, naïve, goodhearted American Joe would give you – this G.I. Joe would give you his k – K rations, his C rations, feed the heck out of you, give you a sh – Hershey bar, and then top it off with a cigarette, with a Camel cigarette.</span> <span id="s399">And in the meanwhile, they were killing you, because th – our bodies couldn’t take the food.</span> <span id="s400">The mal-nutritious body just could not take that type of treatment.</span> <span id="s401">Then the medics came, so what did they do?</span> <span id="s402">They came to these camps and they took their uniforms off and burned them, and put on whatever clothes they could get from UNRRA, from any organization, they start putting clothes on us.</span> <span id="s403">As good as they were, thousands and thousands of survivors died after ha – after the – after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Just because they didn’t know what to do for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: They didn’t know what to do with us, until the medical groups came when they finally decided that that’s not the way to treat them.</span> <span id="s406">And then, of course, then they opened the displaced person camps, and which I was not part of ba – part of one, but – and I’ve seen displaced person camps, and let me tell you, I’m glad I wasn’t a part of one, because displaced person camps were just like camps.</span> <span id="s407">They were not like Nazi – End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel.</span> <span id="s409">This is tape number one, side B. And as the tape was ending you were explaining that because of malnourishment, that when you would – when the G.I.s in their – in their well-meaning way would give you food that was too rich for you and in too large quantities and that it – your bodies couldn’t handle it.</span> <span id="s410">What was it like for you when they first gave you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Well, when I was picked up at the United States forces, and – and the field kitchen was operating, you – you – they had all field kitchens, I don’t know if you know what a field kitchen is, but it’s an army unit kitchen.</span> <span id="s412">And they tried to f – they fed me too, and I had a problem.</span> <span id="s413">The first thing is, the food went right through me.</span> <span id="s414">And I was very fortunate, we had a medic on – with us, a medical unit with us, and they gave me some – some – some coal tablets, you know, charcoal tablets to stop – stop my – my – my – my – my –</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Diarrhea?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Diarrhea.</span> <span id="s417">And one of the doctors tried to s-say di – don’t give him so much food, you know.</span> <span id="s418">Of course that’s easy for – for him to say don’t give me so much food, because he didn’t stand in the chow line wi – like I did.</span> <span id="s419">I had a [indecipherable] on the chow line and I piled it up.</span> <span id="s420">Of course, it got better with me, I was one of the fortunate ones for this reason, because I was a Kanada worker, I was also in a better physical shape than the other prisoners were.</span> <span id="s421">So I had a little more.</span> <span id="s422">Although I had swollen eyes and swollen feet and swollen hands from malnutrition, but I was not as bad off as the other ones.</span> <span id="s423">So it took less time for me to digest – to – to – to – to be able to digest the food.</span> <span id="s424">And it took awhile, I would say it took a couple of weeks at least, but I was always hungry.</span> <span id="s425">I was always the first one in the chow line.</span> <span id="s426">And then I st – then, of course, put me to work in the kitchen, see, and I was working you n – in – in the mess kitchen.</span> <span id="s427">So that was even better.</span> <span id="s428">And we had a – we had a cook, this mess sergeant, I don’t know if you know what a mess sergeant is.</span> <span id="s429">That’s the guy who is in charge of the army ki-kitchen.</span> <span id="s430">He has cooks under him.</span> <span id="s431">His name was sad sack, they used to call him sad sack.</span> <span id="s432">And he would kind of take care of me and we used to – he used to go into town and – and we used to – he-he was stationed in Furth, Germany, f-u-r-t-h, which is a s – a suburb of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s433">But I found out of course, many years later, Henry Kissinger came from Furth.</span> <span id="s434">And he would go to this small town, go to the farm, steal a few chickens, steal some fresh milk and bring them back to the G.I.s, bring them back to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s435">And we had fresh eggs.</span> <span id="s436">Normally we used to have powder eggs, the army powder eggs.</span> <span id="s437">And he would take me with him in the Jeep and we would go organize.</span> <span id="s438">The reason he took me with him, because I spoke German.</span> <span id="s439">For a couple of cigarettes he would get anything he wanted in a farm – farm place.</span> <span id="s440">So for me it’s – didn’t take as long to get down to the system where I could eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: What other physical problems did you have once they – you were there with the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Well, at Auschwitz, my fingers and my toes were frozen.</span> <span id="s443">So, I had very poor circulation in my – in my hands, in my feet, my blood circulation.</span> <span id="s444">And when I was examined, which I can show you, when I was sworn into the United States Armed Forces, when I was examined by the medical group of – in the army, they did find a little – they don’t put it down there as much, but they found some wrong.</span> <span id="s445">I had cracked fingers, my fingers opened up because of the froze – ba – frostbite and same thing with my toes.</span> <span id="s446">My – all my hair fell off from my legs, and that was because the blood circulation was poor.</span> <span id="s447">And my fingers, even to this date, when it s – gets real cold, tips of my fingers get white, even with gloves on.</span> <span id="s448">So that was one medical problem I had.</span> <span id="s449">Other than that, I didn’t have too many problems, medical problems, except being afraid of doctors and not going to one and probably if I would have gone to doctors and they would have possibly gave me some sort of mediation to – to – to make me better, I probably would have been better.</span> <span id="s450">But I – I – I healed quite fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Did the G.I.s there, did they ask you about what had happened to you?</span> <span id="s452">Were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: I found some of them that got to be interested much later.</span> <span id="s454">See, when I was with – picked up by the army, last days of ni – o-of March 19 twe – 1945, first part of ma – April.</span> <span id="s455">April 6, 1945, President Roosevelt died, and I was already in with this unit.</span> <span id="s456">74 – 774 tank battalion, and I remember over the army radio system came the news and everybody was so hushed up about it, so you know, President Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s457">That was April 6th, 1945.</span> <span id="s458">And by then I was getting, you know, much better.</span> <span id="s459">So some of the boys after the war, May 8th, 1945, some of the boys – I found a couple of Jewish boys in the sa – in the unit.</span> <span id="s460">One would not eat un-kosher food, so he was given special – special food.</span> <span id="s461">And this guy wanted to know more, a little bit more about it, and since he found out that most of the Jews were murdered in Europe, so he started asking me the questions, so I would talk to him a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s462">Then, was a chaplain there also, and the chaplain would ask, but very few people really cared, because you know, here were these young boys, 19 – 20 – 21 years old boys away from those – 4,000 miles away from their home, they would sing [sings] I’ll be home for Christmas, 1945, you know.</span> <span id="s463">Or singing that type of song and worrying about one thing only, letters from home.</span> <span id="s464">Mail call was the biggest thing in the world because you were late – letter from your mom, from your girlfriend, from your brothers, from your sisters and this was the big thing.</span> <span id="s465">I was a small fry.</span> <span id="s466">Here I was, a Jewish boy who survived concentration camps they knew nothing about.</span> <span id="s467">And not only they knew nothing about, some of them could care less.</span> <span id="s468">To them a crap game was more interesting than my story, which I didn’t tell, to certain groups.</span> <span id="s469">I tell you, this Jewish guy, a Sephardic Jew, is a – came from a Spanish type of family, and he was very much interested.</span> <span id="s470">He was a religious person and he wanted to know what ha – why did the Jew – why did they do it to Jews, he would ask me.</span> <span id="s471">I wish I could tell you why they do it – did it to Jews.</span> <span id="s472">But the Jews were the one earmarked for ba – to be – to be murdered.</span> <span id="s473">And he was the only one that I would conver – oh, and the teacher, sorry, Feldman, who came from Boston.</span> <span id="s474">He was another one, he wanted to know what happened, because his parents and his grandparents came from somewhere in eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s475">But other than that most of them get a furlough to go to Paris to have a good time with the girls.</span> <span id="s476">That was the main thing.</span> <span id="s477">Get a weekend pass, or go to town.</span> <span id="s478">We were stationed then still in Germany, but on the way from Germany towards France, because this unit, 770 – 774 tank battalion, these boys had enough points – and let me explain what the points were.</span> <span id="s479">Points were, if you served in service that such and such – long time, you were given points for each month.</span> <span id="s480">And if you were married and had family, that was extra points, so you could come home earlier.</span> <span id="s481">Now this bat-battalion, 774 tank battalion was ready to go home in September 1945.</span> <span id="s482">Now here they go from Germany with a convoy we going towards France.</span> <span id="s483">We ended up in the camp called Camp Lucky Strike.</span> <span id="s484">Camp Lucky Strike, the ne – Holocaust Museum has a photograph of me in the Camp Lucky Strike, in a tent picture, I’m – I’m in a tent over there.</span> <span id="s485">Outside a tent, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s486">And now we come to LaHavre, France.</span> <span id="s487">And here’s an interesting story.</span> <span id="s488">I’m sure I told this to the Holocaust Museum, but I’m going to repeat it if I – if I did, so I’ll repeat it.</span> <span id="s489">LaHavre, France was an embarkation, it was the – this ab – th – where the camp – embarkation camp, this is where you got on ships to go back home.</span> <span id="s490">Now here is my unit going on a ship called Lieutenant Colonel James Barker.</span> <span id="s491">That’s the troop carrier.</span> <span id="s492">The na – that ship is named after this colonel.</span> <span id="s493">Now they don’t know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s494">They wanted to put me on a ship, and I’m ready to go.</span> <span id="s495">I would be going on the ship with them to go to United States.</span> <span id="s496">Well, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an attorney from home says, we’re gonna get him in trouble.</span> <span id="s497">What they wanted to do, the other captain wanted to do, take him – go into Boston, to – tha-that was our – the – they would stop in Boston, we would get discharged in Boston, get our – get our papers in Boston, and then leave for Boston.</span> <span id="s498">Get our papers and everything else.</span> <span id="s499">Discharge papers.</span> <span id="s500">Well, Captain Yogerling(ph) felt if I’m going to be put on a ship – the other captain said, let’s take him on with us, put him on the ship and when we get to Boston, turning him in to the authorities, to immigration office, and tell them he’s got an aunt here he – he can go to his aunt.</span> <span id="s501">Now, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an attorney from home, this is nuts, this is illegal entry to United States and he will be punished, he will – he will be sent – sent back to where – wherever they send him back.</span> <span id="s502">So Captain Yogerling(ph) decided un – took me on a Jeep, with my duffle bag – and the guys collected money.</span> <span id="s503">The – the – my group, company A, which I was with, they collected dollars to give me, you know, to – so I have some money with me.</span> <span id="s504">They took me – Captain Yogerling(ph) drove me to Camp Home Run, which was – that was the name of the camp, which was an embarkation camp, but I’m going to tell you what the camp meant – may be an embarkation.</span> <span id="s505">Replacement troops.</span> <span id="s506">This is what the troops will be coming to replace the troops that went home.</span> <span id="s507">And I went to the Camp Home Run, the Captain Yogerling(ph) took me with him, took me to the camp commander.</span> <span id="s508">And the camp commander kind of welcomed me, they got – they stuck me with the name Chesskey(ph), you know, that was the – that was given to me already by this unit.</span> <span id="s509">Captain Yogerling(ph) said that’s what they call him, Chesskey(ph).</span> <span id="s510">So I got into this camp, and what I be gi – what kind of job they give me?</span> <span id="s511">To be in charge of a officer’s dry cleaning and laundry, manned by German prisoners, all right?</span> <span id="s512">First thing the captain of – of – of Home Run, Captain Home Run tells me who was in charge of us in that area.</span> <span id="s513">He says to me, Chesskey(ph), you’re going to be working, you’re going to be in charge of this laundry.</span> <span id="s514">Now, there are German prisoners there.</span> <span id="s515">We didn’t come here to make concentration camps, we came here to bring democracy.</span> <span id="s516">And that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s517">I was there, I was sworn into the United States Armed Forces at Camp Home Run with another fellow, whose name is also misspelled on the list you have, whose name was Raymond Delafonte(ph) Quinones(ph).</span> <span id="s518">He was a Spaniard, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s519">Now we sworn into United States Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s520">However, it was a wrong form, a regular army form.</span> <span id="s521">United States has two armies.</span> <span id="s522">Army of United States and regular army.</span> <span id="s523">Well, the colonel who swore us in tipped [indecipherable] over it and put down Army of United States, sent it to the war department of Washington.</span> <span id="s524">Oh, I would say a couple of months later, came back disapproved.</span> <span id="s525">Attached new forms to re-sign.</span> <span id="s526">In the meanwhile, my aunt was found in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s527">There was a Jewish chaplain whose na – are also from Chicago, in Camp Home Run, whose name was Michael Lipschitz(ph), and Michael Lipschitz(ph), I to – showed him I f – my aunt was found too, by the Red Cross and by the army, what do I do?</span> <span id="s528">He went to the colonel, the company – the – the – th-the – the – the camp commander and he told him the story, so I didn’t have to re-sign.</span> <span id="s529">Raymond Dellafonta(ph) Quinones(ph), soon as he signed the new papers, was shipped to South Pacific.</span> <span id="s530">And this what would happen to me.</span> <span id="s531">Now waiting for my aunt papers to come, and the army papers came, the army gave me referral to go to Czechoslovakia go pick up some passports and – and – an-and birth certificates.</span> <span id="s532">But sha – never got a birth certificate.</span> <span id="s533">Passport I bought in – in Paris at the Czech embassy, and I came to this – and that’s how I came to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Where did you – did you go to Boston?</span> <span id="s535">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span> <span id="s537">When I came to United States?</span> <span id="s538">No, no, I didn’t go with – on a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So you flew?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I flew on TWA.</span> <span id="s541">It was a – they had e-e-emergency flights, like for instance, let’s say a G.I.’s mother is dying, or died, they would – they would fly him home.</span> <span id="s542">And I was on one of those planes and I was on the standby, and they had found a seat for me.</span> <span id="s543">And I came to United States May 10th, 19 – May – May 10th, 1946.</span> <span id="s544">Took 17 hours to get here by TWA flight.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Had you ever been in a plane before?</span> <span id="s546">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: I didn’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Scary, because first of all it was very noisy.</span> <span id="s551">Awfully noisy.</span> <span id="s552">We stopped in – in – in Iceland.</span> <span id="s553">That’s where we, I guess –</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Refueled.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: – refueled, yeah.</span> <span id="s556">And I was scared t-to death.</span> <span id="s557">I came to New York on a Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s558">I went to s – went to a family that knew my family, that knew my aunt and also knew my parents.</span> <span id="s559">These were religious Jews, of course –</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: How – how did you find them?</span> <span id="s561">How did you find out –</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Oh they – I got my aunts – my aunt gave me the information.</span> <span id="s563">Oh, I got to – they were the ones who helped my aunt to – to – to get transportation for me.</span> <span id="s564">There – they were in – fur manufacturers in New York City, quite Orthodox religious.</span> <span id="s565">Very – in fact, very Orthodox religious.</span> <span id="s566">And I arrive on a Saturday, Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s567">So I went through the immigration office and you gotta pay head tax, six dollars head tax.</span> <span id="s568">And I had money sewn in a duffle bag, but I didn’t want to [indecipherable] duffle bag [indecipherable] because they told me that you’re only allowed to bring so much money.</span> <span id="s569">I didn’t have six dollars.</span> <span id="s570">So the immigration officer was a Jewish guy and he paid for me, and he says, I know.</span> <span id="s571">I saw y – I tried to call the Birman(ph) family, the people that I went to, they lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s572">And he says, don’t even try calling him.</span> <span id="s573">They won’t answer this – the phone on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s574">So he put me on a subway to get to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s575">And that’s how I got to the people.</span> <span id="s576">I knocked on the door, I – and they were – had the Sabbath lunch.</span> <span id="s577">I come over there and then they direct me to the bathroom, and what do I do in the bathroom?</span> <span id="s578">I shave.</span> <span id="s579">One of the son comes in he says, you don’t do this on Saturday.</span> <span id="s580">I come out, eat lunch, put a cigarette in my mouth.</span> <span id="s581">You can’t smoke on Saturday.</span> <span id="s582">So the old man, Mr. Birman(ph) says to me now, you know, I am not God’s policeman, but you can’t s-s-smoke here on Shabbas – on Sabbath.</span> <span id="s583">But they were very, very lovely people.</span> <span id="s584">They helped me.</span> <span id="s585">In fact they – they took me to buy me the first suit.</span> <span id="s586">You know, they were the new manufact – in those days th-things were still on ration, so to speak, you know there was a – nothing was – you couldn’t buy a shirt there – a shirt, or suits.</span> <span id="s587">They took me to a suit manufacturer and bought me a – bought me a suit, shirt, tie.</span> <span id="s588">Then they took the la – Mrs. Birman(ph) took me next day to Macy’s and bought me a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s589">And I took my uniform, of course home, my army uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So, I’m trying to imagine, here you are, you’ve just come over from Europe, from Auschwitz, a-agreed wi – with the period of time with these G.I.s and you get on your first plane in your life and you come to New York, one of the largest cities in the world, I think it was the largest at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: And – and all of a sudden you’re on the subway.</span> <span id="s593">Had you been in a subway?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Never.</span> <span id="s595">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: It just seems like –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Never been on a – never been on a bus, let alone a subway.</span> <span id="s598">I was in – in Jeeps, and I was in trucks, in G.I. trucks.</span> <span id="s599">That – that I drove.</span> <span id="s600">Motorcycles the G.I.s used to steal from the Germans.</span> <span id="s601">But then, never on a subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: I know it’s 50 years a –</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: All I had on me – all I had with me was my uniform, my duffle bag and my field bag.</span> <span id="s604">Do you know what a field bag is like?</span> <span id="s605">A carry on bag to [indecipherable] you would call it today.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: I know it’s 50 years ago, but do you remember anything of that day and what it was like to see New York, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: I’ll tell you something, I was gazing up in the sky.</span> <span id="s608">I never forget when the guy put me on the subways tres – train, and he told me what station to get off, you know, watch for the station.</span> <span id="s609">And I asked people next to me, could you help me with the station?</span> <span id="s610">And that’s how I got off.</span> <span id="s611">And then I got to Brooklyn, now I gotta walk up the steps from the k – from the – from the subway to the street.</span> <span id="s612">Now what’s – that’s not too hard because it was all written, you know, there’s a – the streets were marked.</span> <span id="s613">And that wasn’t too – too hard, but what was the hardest part, Saturday evening after Sabbath, the Birman(ph) boys and their wives, they were older than I, took me for a ride to Manhattan to buy a newspaper.</span> <span id="s614">They wanted to go to Manhattan, to show me Manhattan.</span> <span id="s615">I never seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s616">I’ve never seen so many tall buildings.</span> <span id="s617">My li – my – was scratching my – stretching my neck like a giraffe, you know, that’s all I was looking at.</span> <span id="s618">And next day, Sunday, they had a summer home in New Jersey on the le – on the lake, so they took me there.</span> <span id="s619">So that was my introduction to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: How long did you stay with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: A little – little over a week.</span> <span id="s622">In fact, they were talking maybe I can work for them in the – in the fur factory as a runner, as a you know, th – gopher, you know.</span> <span id="s623">But my aunt insisted I, after all, I’m her brother’s son.</span> <span id="s624">So I went to Detroit by – by train, by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Now, you’d been on trains, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: On trains, yes.</span> <span id="s627">On trains in France, I mean, in the army.</span> <span id="s628">Yeah, I been in trains in Slovakia too.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s630">So you took a train to see her, she met you at the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: She met me at a train station, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Now, you’d never met her, obviously?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Oh, I met my aunt in –</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Oh, that’s right, before ’39, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Before ’39, yes, I met my aunt and my uncle.</span> <span id="s636">She was the only one that survived because she is the wa – only one that ran away.</span> <span id="s637">In fact, we have a letter here at home, a number of letters from her and to her, what we used to write, my parents and kid – all the kids used to add a line or two.</span> <span id="s638">My aunt asked to – my mother asked my aunt to take – take me with them when they left for ya – for the States.</span> <span id="s639">My father wouldn’t let us – la – la – wouldn’t even hear of it.</span> <span id="s640">He felt it’s going to go over, nothing is gonna happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: What was it like to reunite this – she was now your only relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Only relative, yes, and her – and her son.</span> <span id="s643">She had a little baby boy three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s645">Was that just –</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Well, you know, I wish I could explain that feeling.</span> <span id="s647">I – of course it was emotional to her, you know, but me, it’s a – you know, I been by myself for so many years, you know, this is – so I came to her ap – she had an apartment, she gave me a little small room with a Murphy bed in it, and I really don’t know ho-how to explain that feeling, it was – it was kind of strange feeling, here I am from the camps, from the army, into civilization.</span> <span id="s648">Didn’t know how to cope with it.</span> <span id="s649">I had a hard time coping with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: H-How would that manifest itself?</span> <span id="s651">What – what did you – you had a hard time coping, how would that play itself out?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Well, as soon as I got a job I kind of readjusted because I got busy with – with my work.</span> <span id="s653">Now I’m going to tell you how – interesting how I got the job.</span> <span id="s654">Foreign speaking salesman wanted, that’s how I got the job.</span> <span id="s655">Mr. Zolcar(ph), the boss was in th – five foot man.</span> <span id="s656">He had two sons working for him in the store and a son-in-law, and me, plus a few other people and the manager of the store, whose name was Joe Zwartney(ph).</span> <span id="s657">And when I got there the old man looks at me and speaks with a Yiddish accent, he said, are you a salesman?</span> <span id="s658">I told him I just came to America a few days ago.</span> <span id="s659">And asked me what languages you speak?</span> <span id="s660">I tell him.</span> <span id="s661">He said, go in the shipping room – the stock room, see Joe Zwartney(ph).</span> <span id="s662">Zwartney(ph) spoke a number of languages, American born Pole, Polish guy.</span> <span id="s663">He spoke Yiddish, he spoke Polish, he spoke Hungarian, he had all the languages, because that – that was a store.</span> <span id="s664">And the old man didn’t tell me I’m going to pay you six dollars, or seven dollars or whatever, he didn’t tell me how much he’s going to pay me.</span> <span id="s665">This is Monday morning, Saturday is payday and everybody got paid in a small envelope, cash.</span> <span id="s666">He gave me 56 dollars, my first week’s pay.</span> <span id="s667">That’s a lot of money in 1946.</span> <span id="s668">So I stayed with him for almost six years and I learned the business, then I became a shoe buyer, that’s how I knew the New England shoe companies.</span> <span id="s669">And I stayed with him until six years, then I went to work for another company, and I ended up with the company I mentioned called Shopper’s Fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: How long were you in Detroit before you met your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: A little – my wife got there in March 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s673">So you were there for –</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I was there from May 10th, 1946 until March 1947 before I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Tell me about what life was like for you in that period.</span> <span id="s676">Other than work, what would you do?</span> <span id="s677">What did you do with yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well, I played soccer.</span> <span id="s679">I went to the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s680">I met with people like myself, other survivors.</span> <span id="s681">We became – we were called the new Americans.</span> <span id="s682">We had meetings.</span> <span id="s683">We had people that would do music, you know, all sorts of music and we had people that were interested in our life stories.</span> <span id="s684">There was a guy who owned a supermarket chain, a Jewish person who was a – quite a philanthropist.</span> <span id="s685">He hired a number of us – not me, but he hired a number of the boys to work on supermarkets.</span> <span id="s686">Some of them he made managers i-in there – in – in there – in s -- in some time, as – as soon as they learned the tricks of the trade, so to speak.</span> <span id="s687">So we – we kind of kept to ourselves, because – you know what they used to calls us?</span> <span id="s688">Greeners.</span> <span id="s689">Greeners mean green people.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: New.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: New people, and greenhorns.</span> <span id="s692">They call us greenhorns.</span> <span id="s693">In Yiddish griners(ph).</span> <span id="s694">And that’s how we kept going.</span> <span id="s695">Soccer was really helpful to me.</span> <span id="s696">It got all the anxiety out of you, the nervousness out of you.</span> <span id="s697">You kicked the ball you were kicking the Germans, you know, an-and that type of thing.</span> <span id="s698">So – and of course I met some good people in soccer too, some of the old time Germans who came here before us.</span> <span id="s699">One was the Metropolitan Life Insurance salesman, he’s on the picture with – on th – on the soccer team with us, he was our manager.</span> <span id="s700">And every person who played for him bought his – bought the policies, and that was his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Did you, when you were wi – together with these other survivors that you were socializing with and playing soccer with, did you talk about your experiences much with th –</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Among ourselves, yes.</span> <span id="s703">Among ourselves we used to.</span> <span id="s704">You know, we didn't believe ourselves that we still were free yet, you know, we were still, you remember what happened there, you remember what happened here.</span> <span id="s705">And remember when you worked over there and you did over there, and then – and that type of – oh, Auschwitz always came up.</span> <span id="s706">See, because we were one of the first ones in this country, and some of us were old time survivors.</span> <span id="s707">You had some Polish Jewish boys there who not only suffered in Auschwitz, but suffered before Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s708">They suffered in Warsaw ghetto and Bialystok ghetto, Lódz ghetto.</span> <span id="s709">So these guys, from ’41 on had a – a hell of a tough time with their – in their lives, lost all – everybody – I don’t remember anyone of these boys who played on the soccer team that came with a sibling or a parent.</span> <span id="s710">Lone survivors.</span> <span id="s711">Yeah, one of them did.</span> <span id="s712">One had a brother, yeah.</span> <span id="s713">And he is on the – they’re both on the team with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Did you find that you were any more or less comfortable in their company than with other –</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No, because I soon became friendly with American – American boys.</span> <span id="s716">I met two brothers, two Jewish boys, you know, Fleischer(ph) boys.</span> <span id="s717">Their name is – last name is Fleischer(ph), Matt and Ben Fleischer(ph).</span> <span id="s718">And both of them were in armed servi – one was in the army, one was in the navy during World War II, and we became quite friendly.</span> <span id="s719">And I-I st – I started to break away from that group and started to find more American friends.</span> <span id="s720">Soon my wife and I – of course we be – we did belong to the newcomer club, that – that we did, that we joined.</span> <span id="s721">It was a – it was a club that you joined and then it was all survivors.</span> <span id="s722">Or survivors married non-survivors.</span> <span id="s723">You know, like one girl married an American, the other – the other boy married an American girl, you know, that was – that ca – that type of a mixture.</span> <span id="s724">I-I-In the 40’s, you know, the shidduch – the – the – the – the matchmakers was – was – was – the still – still in action among the Jewish crowds, among the Jewish parents.</span> <span id="s725">You know, they would ask who are you, what are you, how old are you?</span> <span id="s726">Boy, have I got a daughter for you.</span> <span id="s727">You know, that type of story, see?</span> <span id="s728">So with me, it didn’t work that way.</span> <span id="s729">I was going with another girl before I met Agnes.</span> <span id="s730">I shouldn’t say it so loud.</span> <span id="s731">And all this girl wanted to do was get married.</span> <span id="s732">And anything and anything – anything goes, but she wants to get married.</span> <span id="s733">And my aunt was in love with the girl.</span> <span id="s734">She thought she was the greatest thing for me.</span> <span id="s735">But I found out soon that she was not for me, and when I met Agnes, see.</span> <span id="s736">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Tell me about meeting your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: It’s a very interesting meeting, actually.</span> <span id="s739">As I told you, there was a school at the Jewish Community Center what was teaching newcomers English.</span> <span id="s740">But we also had meetings there with the – with the soccer team, the Jewish soccer team, these were called the Maccabees.</span> <span id="s741">And I would go to t – Thursday was our meetings and Thursday was their school.</span> <span id="s742">So every time you went to the meeting, after the meeting I would walk into the class – I knew the teacher, to look to see if there are new girls in the class.</span> <span id="s743">Well, here I see this young, good looking lady, Agnes, with another man who came with her, also a survivor and he walked her, it was – it was a walking distance from the me – it wasn’t that far, maybe a mile walk.</span> <span id="s744">And I started walking with them.</span> <span id="s745">And being an old American already, almost a year, I took them to Saunder’s.</span> <span id="s746">Saunder’s was a ice cream and – and confectionary place where you could buy cakes, ice cream.</span> <span id="s747">Being a hotshot I knew what to buy, ap-apple pie and ice cream, you know, and coffee.</span> <span id="s748">And then I walked them home, and I got – kind of pushed this guy aside, and before you knew it, we started dating.</span> <span id="s749">We dated from I would say end of March ’47, and then the following year, February, we got married.</span> <span id="s750">February 22nd.</span> <span id="s751">And the wedding was in a house, Agnes’s aunt’s and uncle’s house.</span> <span id="s752">Wer – we got married by the same rabbi who married Agnes’s parents in Hungary.</span> <span id="s753">Name was [indecipherable] and he married us.</span> <span id="s754">Gypsy music playing, because these were Hungarian Jews, Gypsy music they brought, playing and – you know.</span> <span id="s755">And, a nice – nice affair, la – home – home – home in the house.</span> <span id="s756">Hippa(ph) and th – you know, the canopy.</span> <span id="s757">And one of my friends was my best man, an American boy who became – was my best friend.</span> <span id="s758">So that’s how we met and we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: I want to slightly move your mike stand to just –</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Li – blocking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: No, no, it’s just – it turns out that it’s better for you [indecipherable] hear, because if you’re looking at me, it’s closer to the mark.</span> <span id="s762">You’ve told me that living with your aunt, that she was not interested in talking about what had happened –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: – that she was very much, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Well, she was afraid of it.</span> <span id="s766">She was actually afraid of it, she didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s767">My aunt had some psychological problems, I think.</span> <span id="s768">We found out much later she had Alzheimer’s.</span> <span id="s769">But she never wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s770">She had a only child.</span> <span id="s771">After 18 years of being married, the kid was born.</span> <span id="s772">They didn't want to have any children in sh – in Austria, so they came here and it took them a long time before they had the child.</span> <span id="s773">And now is no – he is now in his 50’s.</span> <span id="s774">He was – he was three years old in 1946, so in his 50’s.</span> <span id="s775">What is – what is he?</span> <span id="s776">How old is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: He would be 50 fi – 55.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Is he – is that your only relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: That’s all, yes, mm-hm, my first cousin.</span> <span id="s781">Very prominent attorney in Cincinnati, one of the largest law firms, and not only in Cincinnati but all over the wor – all over the – they have some in Europe, in – in Asia they got law offices.</span> <span id="s782">And he is a – he was the first Jewish boy hired by this law firm.</span> <span id="s783">It was Taft, with one of the Taft family, and Hollister and as – and it’s a huge, huge law firm.</span> <span id="s784">And he’s now a partner there for last, I would say 15 – 20 years.</span> <span id="s785">The first Jew to become a partner of a – of a very kind of Christians – for Christian organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Hold on one sec, I have a feeling – End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel.</span> <span id="s788">This is tape number two, side A. Are you close with your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Very close, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s790">We are – I’m close with his son, they also have one child, same – he follows the same pattern as his parents did, one sin, one son, one boy.</span> <span id="s791">And he’s now just graduated one of the big colleges in the east, and he spent some time in England.</span> <span id="s792">He’s back home now, taking some time out to go to grad school.</span> <span id="s793">And I’m quite close with him.</span> <span id="s794">He does look like my father and his son does also look like my father.</span> <span id="s795">And – red hair like my father had, fire red hair and a very bright, bright, bright guy.</span> <span id="s796">My children love him, you know.</span> <span id="s797">He comes – Thanksgiving is never without him.</span> <span id="s798">In fact, he’s very upset with me, I was supposed to be there last weekend.</span> <span id="s799">He wants us over there so we’ll – we’ll see if – if I can get away from soccer this weekend, we’ll go over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Tell me about your anger, either contemporary or previous.</span> <span id="s801">I mean, over the past 50 odd years since the war ended, have you been angry and – and where does your – where do you direct that?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Well, I don’t know if you can call it anger.</span> <span id="s803">I call it resentment.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Resenting that about myself, that I don’t have anyone – anyone from my immediate family in the – close to me.</span> <span id="s806">I had a brother who was a strong, feisty young man, young boy.</span> <span id="s807">He was murdered weeks after he wa – was taken away by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s808">I had a sister, you’ve seen her picture, pretty strong girl, another one who [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s809">My father, a strong cattle and horse dealer, who fell to the Nazis like – like this.</span> <span id="s810">So my anger is, why me and why not them?</span> <span id="s811">At least, why not me with them?</span> <span id="s812">This is wa – this is what it is.</span> <span id="s813">There are times I feel so lonely about it, so lonesome, yet I am so close with my children.</span> <span id="s814">This is all I have, my children, my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s815">But I’m missing the most important thing in my life.</span> <span id="s816">If you can call it anger, that’s anger.</span> <span id="s817">But I resent, I f – I say why it had to happen to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Do you – is it – is your anger at God?</span> <span id="s819">Is it –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: God?</span> <span id="s821">I have a problem with God.</span> <span id="s822">I have an argument with God.</span> <span id="s823">Of course, he doesn’t answer me.</span> <span id="s824">I never lost the identity where I came from.</span> <span id="s825">Never lost that I was born to a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s826">I was born to a God fearing Jewish family in easter – in Europe, in ch – in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s827">In fact, I was quite religious, for a number of years.</span> <span id="s828">When I got to Auschwitz I still had belief in religion, a belief in God, but I soon lost that.</span> <span id="s829">If God wanted to punish us Jews, if we did something that terribly wrong, punish us for a day, a week or three da – whatever.</span> <span id="s830">But let us suffer from 1939 in Slovakia, in Poland, in Ukraine, in all the other European countries, from 1939 til 1945, let us being systematically murdered, thrown into the ovens.</span> <span id="s831">And me, working the ga – working that railroad tracks, and seeing that with my own eyes, knowing what these mass of thousands upon thousands of people were being herded like sheep, not knowing where they’re going, I have an anger with God.</span> <span id="s832">I have a problem with God.</span> <span id="s833">If it wouldn’t be for Agnes, I probably would never stepped in a temple, my foot in a temple.</span> <span id="s834">She says, we have children, we have to do something.</span> <span id="s835">We have to let them – let them do, and then when they get older let them – let them lead their own way, but teach – show them the way first.</span> <span id="s836">Well, we did that.</span> <span id="s837">Our son was Bar Mitzvah, our little – our young – oldest daughter was Bat Mitzvahed, the other two weren’t.</span> <span id="s838">But I still when I go to the temple I feel like – like a hypocrite.</span> <span id="s839">Where was God for three years, letting this happen, the systematic destruction of every Jew in Europe?</span> <span id="s840">That’s my anger with God.</span> <span id="s841">You know, in Yiddish there – I – I – there’s a saying, Ehob tsores wich hemas borach (ph).</span> <span id="s842">I’ve got troubles with God, problems with God.</span> <span id="s843">Where were you – wh-when – where were you?</span> <span id="s844">There’s some time I’m speak to a group of Christian churches, some – some guy came up to me after the questions and he’s – he – he may [indecipherable] while – while I was answering the question he cames up to the – to the microphone and he says, but you Jews were the chosen people.</span> <span id="s845">So I, being a sarcastic with a sick sense of humor, well why didn’t God choose somebody else for this?</span> <span id="s846">Why were we chosen to be burned and gassed?</span> <span id="s847">So th-th-this is my anger.</span> <span id="s848">I don’t have an ounce of hate in me.</span> <span id="s849">Anger is not hate, because if you hate, you die inside.</span> <span id="s850">I’m angry because this happened, and I’m angry because I’m the only one from my immediate family.</span> <span id="s851">Wouldn’t that be wonderful if my brother would – could see his nieces and nephews being a success?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Were you ever suicidal?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Were you ever suicidal?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Suicidal?</span> <span id="s856">No.</span> <span id="s857">No.</span> <span id="s858">In Auschwitz, yes, I thought about it, but outside of Auschwitz, never.</span> <span id="s859">When I married and started to see my children, I said here is my life.</span> <span id="s860">This is what I want to live for.</span> <span id="s861">In Auschwitz I was this close from running to the fence, to the electric fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: A lot of people did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: I had typhus.</span> <span id="s864">1943, I had typhus in Auschwitz, and I thought for sure that’s the end of me.</span> <span id="s865">When you have typhoid fever in Auschwitz, your equilibrium, you lose that, you lose hearing, totally.</span> <span id="s866">You don’t hear.</span> <span id="s867">And if it wouldn’t be for two guys that saved my life in Kanada commando where I was working – under my ar – under my arms they would drag me through the gates.</span> <span id="s868">When I got to Kanada commando, in a pile of clothes they would cover me up and bring me some water, hot water to drink, with – with lemon if they could find it among the packages that the Jews brought with them.</span> <span id="s869">And that’s how they – that’s how they helped me come out of it.</span> <span id="s870">If they would left me in the barracks, I would have been in the ovens.</span> <span id="s871">And that’s when I wanted to walk to the wires, and they stopped me.</span> <span id="s872">Unfortunately both of them died already.</span> <span id="s873">One died in New York and one died in Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: You say you don’t have an ounce of hate in you.</span> <span id="s875">Who do you – outside of having a problem with God that you’ve talked about, ha-have you struggled with who to blame for what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: The world.</span> <span id="s877">The world looked the other way.</span> <span id="s878">You know, we never believed that anyone knew about us.</span> <span id="s879">We never believed in Auschwitz that anybody knew what was going on because if somebody would believe, somebody would do something.</span> <span id="s880">Somebody would stop.</span> <span id="s881">When I got out of Auschwitz, it took many years to find out wh-who knew and who didn’t know.</span> <span id="s882">United States knew in 1942 that there were Jews being murdered in th – in th – in – in the camps.</span> <span id="s883">They didn't have all the details, but they knew.</span> <span id="s884">How did I find out?</span> <span id="s885">Through documentaries, through Shoah.</span> <span id="s886">Jan Karski, professor at – in Washington, Georgetown University.</span> <span id="s887">He was a Polish courier, he came to this country, came to England, came to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s888">He was talking to these people, to – to the presidents, the Churchill and no one wanted to do – they knew, they believed, but didn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s889">In my stay at Auschwitz, on two occasion the international Red Cross came.</span> <span id="s890">Once in Auschwitz one, and then in Birkenau the following year.</span> <span id="s891">Not one time did the Nazis let them into the barracks.</span> <span id="s892">We were all lined up in a roll call place, standing sc – clean, with clean uniforms.</span> <span id="s893">They cleaned up the camp.</span> <span id="s894">You know what the cleaned up camp meant?</span> <span id="s895">They took all the prisoners who were looking like skeletons, or half skeletons, got them away from there, right in the ovens.</span> <span id="s896">Showered us, so you can call the showers.</span> <span id="s897">Gave us clean stripes.</span> <span id="s898">And they would bring forward – they would talk to – they would put the best looking guys forward, standing forward, and they would let them talk to somebody.</span> <span id="s899">How are you treated?</span> <span id="s900">Oh fine, everything is great.</span> <span id="s901">Course, if you didn’t say that [indecipherable] Red Cross leaves and you know what’s going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s902">The camp was swept clean there a – the – the – the – this – the grounds.</span> <span id="s903">That’s how it was.</span> <span id="s904">So who do you blame?</span> <span id="s905">You blame the world, knowing and not listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: You know it’s – to me it’s interesting, because I didn’t experience what you experienced, that everyone I’ve spoken to, and everyone I’ve – whose memoirs I’ve read or anything, directs their anger there, at the peep – at the rest of the world who s – who sat back and – and didn’t do anything, rather than at the people who did do things, meaning at the people at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Well, let me put you to the people who did their things, okay?</span> <span id="s908">You see, I blame the world for not stopping the people who did it to us.</span> <span id="s909">That’s – that’s the first ones to blame.</span> <span id="s910">Now, let’s go to the people that did it to us.</span> <span id="s911">Who did it to us?</span> <span id="s912">Not just the German Nazi SS, but the Slovakian Nazi guards, the Croatian Nazi guards, the Romanian Nazi guards, the Hungarian Nazi guards.</span> <span id="s913">These were all part of it.</span> <span id="s914">You know, I had at Auschwitz a number of guar – Croatian guards who had SS uniforms on, who were our guards.</span> <span id="s915">And these were the animals, these were the killers.</span> <span id="s916">They were bigger killers in – in a way sometimes than the Nazi Germans killers.</span> <span id="s917">I have testified since 1982.</span> <span id="s918">’82 - ’90 - ’91 - ’92 - ’93, against Nazis, former Nazi aw – guards and officers at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s919">Out of those, three of them were not Germans.</span> <span id="s920">One was a Latvian, the one who elected to be deported.</span> <span id="s921">The other one, in 1990 I testified in Honolulu was a Yugoslavian.</span> <span id="s922">One in September I gave deposition on, two year – three – two years ago, a Slovak, from my country, and the other guy was a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: So clearly it was not only the Germans, I mean this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Well, my own town, who picked me up, who picked up my family?</span> <span id="s925">Our owe – our barber.</span> <span id="s926">Our family barber, his name was Martinchek(ph).</span> <span id="s927">This the guy who picked us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s929">I’m embarrassed to say I can’t remember th-the name of the author, but you’ll know immediately the book I’m talking about, the book that has been such a controversy in the past few years, the Harvard professor –</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, “Hitler’s Willing Executioners.”</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I think it’s one of the best piece of work ever done.</span> <span id="s933">Unfortunately it’s written in – in such a high college terms, cause this guy is an educator, he’s – he did his thesis on that, that it’s – it – you have to read it twice to understand it, for the average person.</span> <span id="s934">But this man did something that was gutsy, that was plain, plain gutsy.</span> <span id="s935">He finally said something that we as survivors hoped somebody would say.</span> <span id="s936">It was the average German, the average person.</span> <span id="s937">It was not the hierarchy of the Nazis who did this, it was every German on the street that did this.</span> <span id="s938">This was Hitler’s willing executioner.</span> <span id="s939">And you couldn’t get a better title in that in a book.</span> <span id="s940">It’s th-the – the writer who wrote it, his name is Goldhagen.</span> <span id="s941">I’ve got the book, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: But would you add to that th-the Slovak on the street, the Croatian on the street, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: I would add every member of the Slovakian community on the street for the simple reason, why did the Slovak did it here?</span> <span id="s944">The Nazis told them, get rid of the Jews, you know what’s gonna happen?</span> <span id="s945">You’re going to get their businesses, you’re going to get their homes, you’re going to get their monies.</span> <span id="s946">Now they got greed and – and anti-Semitism they had to begin with.</span> <span id="s947">They need – they didn’t need – they didn’t need much pushing and shoving.</span> <span id="s948">The – wh-who put me in the cattle cars?</span> <span id="s949">Wasn’t the Nazis.</span> <span id="s950">I never seen a Nazi put me in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s951">Was – was the Slovak guards who, with his wife – with his rifle butts and – and bayonets that start sticking into you, shoving you into the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s952">Goodbye Jews.</span> <span id="s953">These were their famous words, they were the – they would all say goodbye Jews, good riddance.</span> <span id="s954">The guy who took my father’s business became a Nazi.</span> <span id="s955">This – this [indecipherable] Martinchek(ph) who was a barber, he took another guy’s name, Benow(ph), Desdair(ph) Benow’s(ph) business, he – he worked for him before, now he’s got his business.</span> <span id="s956">He put him in the oven – in-into the – into the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s957">So these were there.</span> <span id="s958">Neilosh(ph) in Hungary, the same type of Nazis, and Romania had them.</span> <span id="s959">Yugoslavia had all the Croats.</span> <span id="s960">Franjo Trudman, th-the president of Croatia i-is a big shot.</span> <span id="s961">He was invited to come to the opening of the Holocaust Museum, I almost died, I almost – almost – pardon the expression, threw up when I’ve seen him.</span> <span id="s962">Here comes a Croatian, I don’t care how young he is, but his father was a Nazi and so is he and they’re bringing him to the opening of the Holocaust Museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s963">He had no business there.</span> <span id="s964">He certainly was not a Righteous Gentile.</span> <span id="s965">These were the – these were the – these were the Hitler’s willing executioner, not only in Germany, but in Poland, in Ukraine, in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s966">Every eur – Nazi European country wa-wa – wa – these people collaborated with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s967">Slovakia became a fascist country.</span> <span id="s968">We had a president, who was he?</span> <span id="s969">Josef Tiso, a Catholic pis – a priest.</span> <span id="s970">Very close to my hometown, that’s where he came from.</span> <span id="s971">Anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s972">Jews the Christ killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: But you say you don’t hate?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: No.</span> <span id="s975">No.</span> <span id="s976">In spite of all that, I don’t hate.</span> <span id="s977">But what I wa – what I say is this, when the trial is begun, and I’m not talking about the trials one by one, I’m talking – the biggest farce were the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s978">They brought a few of these bigwigs into the trial, pe – few of them, nicht schuldig, not guilty, hm?</span> <span id="s979">Well, my dear friend, where was the rest of the world, of the Nazi world, that wasn’t tried?</span> <span id="s980">What happened to the Nazi guards, to the Nazi officers who ran these over a hundred concentration camps and death camps?</span> <span id="s981">Where are they?</span> <span id="s982">Living the life of Riley, if they’re still alive today, which mo – a lot of them are.</span> <span id="s983">What happened to them?</span> <span id="s984">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s985">In the Soviet prison they were mistreated, were beaten, sometimes they were starved, whatever, big deal.</span> <span id="s986">By the Americans?</span> <span id="s987">A slap on the wrist, two months in prison, released, go back home.</span> <span id="s988">Nothing happened to them.</span> <span id="s989">They were never on trial.</span> <span id="s990">These were the killers, these were – they should have been on trial.</span> <span id="s991">The-These few people they had lined up the Nuremberg trials, the few hotshots, the few Nazi leaders, that’s nothing.</span> <span id="s992">They did nothing.</span> <span id="s993">United States should be ashamed for even pe-performing that trial over there.</span> <span id="s994">That was an – absolutely a farce, nothing to it.</span> <span id="s995">The words of my captain, Chesskey(ph), we didn’t come here to make a concentration camp, we came here to bring democracy.</span> <span id="s996">Beautiful, bring democracy.</span> <span id="s997">But punish the animals who were killing my father and my mother and my sister and my brother.</span> <span id="s998">Nothing was punished, nothing was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Do you think that if all of the guards and all of the – the people who were in charge at Auschwitz, the people that killed your family, if they were all executed, would you feel better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Not – they don’t have to execute them.</span> <span id="s1001">Don’t have to execute them.</span> <span id="s1002">Bring them on trial, and bring the survivors to be witnesses.</span> <span id="s1003">Bring the survivors to force these guys to tell their life stories, what they did.</span> <span id="s1004">You know, I testified against a guy named ha – Hanscun(ph) – Heinrich Hans Kunneman(ph) in Germany, in Dussberg, Germany in ’91 - ’92 and ’93, three times.</span> <span id="s1005">Actually five times, because two times here, also, you know, at the – at the German – at the German consulates in Chicago and Detroit.</span> <span id="s1006">Here is a man who was in charge of – of the counter-commando, one of the counter-commando pris – Nazis, in front of my eyes murdered a little boy about six years old.</span> <span id="s1007">How did he murder him?</span> <span id="s1008">We were unloading a transport of Jews coming into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1009">This little boy is sitting inside a cattle car crying.</span> <span id="s1010">Hans Kunneman(ph) ha – his name is Heinrich, Hans Kunneman(ph) tells me, go pick up that Jew.</span> <span id="s1011">Pick up the little boy, set him down, kid is still crying.</span> <span id="s1012">Kunneman(ph) walks by the kid because he starts to stop him from crying.</span> <span id="s1013">With his boot he kicks the kid in the head and kills him right there on the spot.</span> <span id="s1014">Little, little shaver, little kid.</span> <span id="s1015">Ta – tells me to pick up the sack of Jewish shit and – and bring him to the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s1016">There I am carrying the limp body of his little boy.</span> <span id="s1017">Hans Kunneman(ph) was then already training to be an opera singer, okay?</span> <span id="s1018">As he walks away from killing the je – little Jewish boy, he is whistling an operatic tune.</span> <span id="s1019">Singing and whistling an operatic tune like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1020">90 – in 1990 I got a call from Germany from a prosecutor.</span> <span id="s1021">I’ve got your name from such and such person, would you be willing to give us a testimony agains – against a former Nazi.</span> <span id="s1022">Didn’t tell me who.</span> <span id="s1023">Course we meet in Chicago at the ger – German consulate – the German consulate on Michigan Avenue, so when?</span> <span id="s1024">It’s like day after Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s1025">So I go over there for Chicago, they bought me a flight ticket or whatever, I’m in a hotel and I get there.</span> <span id="s1026">I testify all day, from nine o’clock in the morning to break for lunch, til six o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s1027">He opens up a book of photographs then, not today, then photographs with the uniforms and everything on.</span> <span id="s1028">Identify this man on three different photographs, plus three other Nazis who also worked in the same position.</span> <span id="s1029">Then I was taken to Germany following summer with my wife.</span> <span id="s1030">Identified them over there just as easy.</span> <span id="s1031">This a – this was a tribunal.</span> <span id="s1032">Eight judge tribunal, not a – not a – a – a jury trial.</span> <span id="s1033">I had a interpreter, and the – and the German attorney sitting next to me.</span> <span id="s1034">There was Kunneman(ph) sitting, he had a court appointed doctor with him, he claimed to be very sick, and these eight judges.</span> <span id="s1035">And I’m testifying and testifying.</span> <span id="s1036">And I was asked, the third time I testified, what would you like that should happen, you know, cause otherwi – I knew I testi – because there was other people testifying.</span> <span id="s1037">But they brought 17 guys to testify against him.</span> <span id="s1038">17 former prisoners.</span> <span id="s1039">Not one of us meet each other – met each other.</span> <span id="s1040">You came on the Saturday, stayed for three days and then you went to court, then you left, then the other guys came on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s1041">One guy at a time.</span> <span id="s1042">So I was asked by one of the judges, how would I – what would – what would I feel that should happen here?</span> <span id="s1043">After all, with your testimony the man should be sentenced.</span> <span id="s1044">Well, I said, I really don’t care if you sentence him.</span> <span id="s1045">I just want one thing from you people.</span> <span id="s1046">If this man will be willing to do what I’m doing.</span> <span id="s1047">I speak about my experiences as a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1048">I go to colleges, universities, high schools, civic, religious organizations.</span> <span id="s1049">Let him come with me.</span> <span id="s1050">Let him tell his – his story about what he did in Auschwitz for the 18 months that I knew him on the ramps.</span> <span id="s1051">For the 18 months that he would direct people, select people to the gas chambers or to slave labor.</span> <span id="s1052">Let him tell what he did and I’ll tell mals – my story.</span> <span id="s1053">The two of us together.</span> <span id="s1054">That would be enough of a sentence for me.</span> <span id="s1055">And that’s the kind of sentence I was hoping the masses of the Nazis would get.</span> <span id="s1056">The masses, in every German community.</span> <span id="s1057">They should be taken to court with so – Holocaust survivors to be there and talk about it and tell them and force them to – to admit that not I followed orders like – like I was told, to do – what to do, I only – even Eichmann in 1961, what he said in – in – in – in Israel?</span> <span id="s1058">I followed orders.</span> <span id="s1059">Well, tell me why did you followed orders?</span> <span id="s1060">You tell this to your community, in front of a survivor who is mentally and physically able to testify.</span> <span id="s1061">That is what I am saying them – should happen to the masses.</span> <span id="s1062">Not once of all these times I testified did I walk out of the courtrooms with a lighter heart, just satisfied that something was done, because there wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1063">One damn Nazi in Honolulu called me a liar.</span> <span id="s1064">He was being tried, he called me a liar.</span> <span id="s1065">He admitted being on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1066">He admitted walking and marching prisoners from and to slave labor.</span> <span id="s1067">And that’s what I told, he was a killer and he calls me a liar.</span> <span id="s1068">And what happened to him?</span> <span id="s1069">He was deported to Germany.</span> <span id="s1070">Big deal.</span> <span id="s1071">I was told that there will be a trial again in Germany, you will be called.</span> <span id="s1072">This was seven years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: I was just thinking of – I don’t mean to make a na – a direct analogy but I know that there are like drunken drivers who have killed people, who go talk to children in schools and say, you know, this is where this led me, this is what I did.</span> <span id="s1074">Learn from me.</span> <span id="s1075">Do you think that if – if these guards and officers and – were to do what you’re talking about, that it would have much of an impact on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: On the civilization, or on me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: On civilization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yes, it would have much impact because you see, Holocaust became fashionable the last number of years.</span> <span id="s1079">It wasn’t fashionable as soon as we got out of there.</span> <span id="s1080">Took – you know, it took Meryl Streep, with the worst piece of drecky work, worst piece of crappy film, called, “The Holocaust,” or whatever y-you – yeah, it’s called – was called “The Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s1081">It made her a star.</span> <span id="s1082">It was the worst piece of junk that was ever produced in ho – it’s Hollywood, you know, it’s a – it’s a – it’s a plastic.</span> <span id="s1083">But what was good about it?</span> <span id="s1084">That was – they had two, two things.</span> <span id="s1085">One, the worst film.</span> <span id="s1086">Second, it had the best thing.</span> <span id="s1087">It got the attention of the pub – the general public.</span> <span id="s1088">Well, this is what the general public now wants today.</span> <span id="s1089">Holocaust is a very fashionable thing, not only because of Spielberg, because of Shoah, and any – any piece of – documentary on Holocaust, true or not true – I-I shouldn’t say not true, accurate or almost inaccurate, it has some affect on people.</span> <span id="s1090">Now, Anne Frank has an affect on people.</span> <span id="s1091">These guys would have a big affect if they would go to colleges and universities, schools and civic and religious organizations.</span> <span id="s1092">Oh yeah, lot of s – lot of our population wouldn’t want to hear that.</span> <span id="s1093">They won’t listen to it.</span> <span id="s1094">Not because they don’t want to hear, but because they don’t think it’s – that should be done.</span> <span id="s1095">I-In Germany nobody wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s1096">Listen, his book, hi – “Hitler’s Willing Executioners” was the biggest seller in Germany.</span> <span id="s1097">He drew more crowd in Germany when he was lecturing there, and there was boycotts there.</span> <span id="s1098">Yet, this is what the people should hear.</span> <span id="s1099">You know, pretty soon there won’t be any survivors left.</span> <span id="s1100">We’re getting to be old people.</span> <span id="s1101">Now, I’m not – I’m – I consider myself still one of the younger guys, but at the same time, every day you got less and less – there’s less and less of us around.</span> <span id="s1102">A-A-Auschwitz will only be a legend.</span> <span id="s1103">Now who’s gonna – other than the Holocaust Museum which I’m doing today, which I did in 1989 for the Holocaust Museum, who is going to be here?</span> <span id="s1104">Just this.</span> <span id="s1105">There won’t be a living person to be able to say things like I say, or like other survivors who are capable of talking.</span> <span id="s1106">So these guys should go out there and do that.</span> <span id="s1107">And let me tell you, they would have a great audience.</span> <span id="s1108">Very – there are so many people that are hungry to know why it happened, because ho – there are not that many of us that go to schools and colleges and universities.</span> <span id="s1109">You know, some of us are getting so old that we – we – we fantasize.</span> <span id="s1110">You know, some people fantasize and I get very upset with it, you know.</span> <span id="s1111">If they don’t remember what happened to them, th-the-they say something different.</span> <span id="s1112">And that’s what gets me very upset.</span> <span id="s1113">And that even gots me u – gets me upset with sp – Spielberg’s interviews.</span> <span id="s1114">I will not be interviewed by Spielberg, no way, no how.</span> <span id="s1115">But let’s leave that alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Well, no, no, not really, because one of the things I was eventually going to ask you is your critique of the books and the movies and the things that have come about in the past, really, mostly the past decade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Yeah, til 10 years.</span> <span id="s1118">I mean, the bi – it wasn’t – well, it became fashion – the Holocaust became fashionable.</span> <span id="s1119">I call it the fashionable time for the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: So – so it’s – I don’t think it’s not germane to this interview to your perspective as one who was there, about how you feel about how it’s been documented, accurately, inaccurately, inappropriately, appropriately.</span> <span id="s1121">In the – in the various ways that people have tried to do.</span> <span id="s1122">So I – that was actually something I was going to ask you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Well, anything done in Hollywood, to me, got me upset, including Simon Wiesenthal’s story, when he was – did some – Simon Wiesenthal did some stuff.</span> <span id="s1124">And I’m – I’m very disturbed with Simon Wiesenthal’s presentation of the – of the television movies.</span> <span id="s1125">It didn’t happen like that, number one and then it’s a fantasizing there a little bit.</span> <span id="s1126">I’ve seen these rubber blown up bodies being taken in Mauthausen concen – Mauthausen concentration camp, which is wrong, totally wrong, you don’t do these things.</span> <span id="s1127">You want to do something?</span> <span id="s1128">Make a documentary.</span> <span id="s1129">Documentary which – which you know how to do.</span> <span id="s1130">The best ever film on Holocaust was “The Shoah.”</span> <span id="s1131">The eight and a half hour program by Lanzmann, the Frenchman who did it.</span> <span id="s1132">This was a piece of work that is the best.</span> <span id="s1133">Other than that, I haven’t seen very li – I’ve seen very little that I would recommend.</span> <span id="s1134">Oh yeah, the people will watch it – which I’m glad they’re watching, because it [indecipherable] gets the attention.</span> <span id="s1135">But a Spielberg movie?</span> <span id="s1136">When I first found out that Steven Spielberg is going to make the Schindler stor – “Schindler’s List,” at first I was wondering.</span> <span id="s1137">I says, here is a guy who is going to make a Holocaust movie.</span> <span id="s1138">He is a man who made “E.T,” what is he going to do with the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1139">You know, he’s got Indiana Jones and “E.T.” Well, when the – “Schindler’s List” came to town, here to Indianapolis, I was invited as a Holocaust survivor to be there for special presentations, and I went.</span> <span id="s1140">Here comes the elite Jewish community of Indianapolis, some of the elite guys, some of the big givers, what do you call, they come there.</span> <span id="s1141">Everyone’s got a popcorn in their – bag in their hand, puts their feet on – on – on the other seat and stretch themselves, I hope there’s a – there is a nice popcorn movie tos – to watch.</span> <span id="s1142">So here I am listening, watching, and watching because [indecipherable] what – what this guy could do, what he did with it.</span> <span id="s1143">And I walked out of there really almost satisfied that he did a good job.</span> <span id="s1144">If he’d shown any more atrocities than he showed in the film, I don’t think people could have sit through it.</span> <span id="s1145">Some of it was a little schmaltzy.</span> <span id="s1146">I was a little bit – you know, I watched it so closely.</span> <span id="s1147">When Oskar Schindler said at the end, I should have done more, I should have done this, I should have that, I – I’d – I didn’t do enough, I should have saved more people, those words, well that was a little schmaltzy to me, you know.</span> <span id="s1148">Th-That – that – that they could have left out.</span> <span id="s1149">Yes, Oskar Schindler did help.</span> <span id="s1150">There’s 5,000 survivors of that group that are alive today because of him.</span> <span id="s1151">You know, 5,000 members of the families that came la – after.</span> <span id="s1152">So that – that’s – it was fairly – done fairly decent.</span> <span id="s1153">But the other ones, I don’t remember of any other one, other than Sobibor, “Escape From Sobibor,” I’m sorry, that was done because they found people that survived Sobibor and these were the people that helped, same as Oskar Schindler got the – got the book from a – from a – from the luggage store in – in L.A. and here’s these guys from th – Long Island, New York who were Sobibor survivors, they helped with the movie.</span> <span id="s1154">Well, that was almost – pretty accurate.</span> <span id="s1155">But other than that, there is nothing.</span> <span id="s1156">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1157">Kirk Douglas was in the movie one time, and I – I tell you something, I – I was going to go over there and kick the hell out of him for that movie.</span> <span id="s1158">But if – but you di – what it is, the American public.</span> <span id="s1159">They eat it up.</span> <span id="s1160">They listen to it, they want to know.</span> <span id="s1161">See, I’d – I – I become like a – like – like a Mattel toy, somebody wind you up and you keep going.</span> <span id="s1162">Because all of a sudden they said, oh you – Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1163">Call Mike Vogel.</span> <span id="s1164">All right, so th – Mike Vogel, ah – wind you up, send you to the school.</span> <span id="s1165">You know, that type of stuff.</span> <span id="s1166">I’ve got enough here to write a book just – just for the letters I’d received from universities, colleges, civic and religious organizations, just – just the letters that they talk about my – my being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1168">Because you’ve done so much public speaking and – and you’ve told your story so often, in – since that time when your daughter, in eighth grade –</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: – when you went to her class – I don’t know how to ask this question properly, and I mean no disrespect –</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel.</span> <span id="s1174">This is tape number two, side B, and I was asking Mr. Vogel whether through repetition of telling your story in all the many times that you’ve told it now, whether it has lost for you any – any connection to your emotions, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: It’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s1176">You know, although the story is the same, it’s not the same.</span> <span id="s1177">Like some – some – on many occasions, many places, comes out – you know, starts out a little different.</span> <span id="s1178">It depends.</span> <span id="s1179">Lot of time I’m looking at the audience.</span> <span id="s1180">I – the stories – I – I can’t change the stories, I can’t exchange my style of it, I – but I tell it, but sometime it’s much stronger, or sometime it’s a little weaker, depending on the audience.</span> <span id="s1181">But it’s not – I don’t feel it repetitious.</span> <span id="s1182">I tell it from day one, before, during and after the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1183">And – an-and it’s not a routine.</span> <span id="s1184">It always like a new story, if you know what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s1185">And when it becomes even more interesting, it depends on the audience, their questions.</span> <span id="s1186">When their questions come, and when you talk to graduate students, when you talk to clergy, when you talk to people that are really knowledgeable, that – that some are even scholars, a-and book writers, then it becomes even more powerful.</span> <span id="s1187">You gotta remember, when I’m speaking to high school students, I don’t get the same questions from high school kids that I get from a graduate student.</span> <span id="s1188">So it becomes more powerful.</span> <span id="s1189">And a lot of times it’s surprising, some of these private schools, like high schools and even middle schools, ask a better question than some of the college students.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: That’s what I was going to ask you, whether there’s exceptions that rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Exception to that rule, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Do you have any – I realize you’ve done this many times, but is there anything that jumps out at you, an anecdote of – you know, out of the mouths of babes, some insightful question that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: I wish I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Here I am, I-I’ve gotten through a – a tiny bit of the questions that I – that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: You got more to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: This is terrible.</span> <span id="s1197">I mean terrible only that I’m taking so much of your time.</span> <span id="s1198">There were a couple more.</span> <span id="s1199">This is – I – I apologize for –</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: – for not being better organized with this, but there are a few more questions that they wanted me to ask you that still pertain to the video interview that there were a couple of holes in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: They wanted me to ask you about the trans part from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Where you were going next.</span> <span id="s1206">Was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1209">Did you – did you know where you were going?</span> <span id="s1210">A: No.</span> <span id="s1211">When they uprooted us nighttime from the barracks, Kanada commando was dissolved already.</span> <span id="s1212">There were no more transports coming in.</span> <span id="s1213">This is October 1944.</span> <span id="s1214">We thought for sure that they’re taking us to the gas chambers because we’ve seen so much, number one.</span> <span id="s1215">Of course we didn’t know that – we thought we were the last Jews alive to begin with.</span> <span id="s1216">Now, here we go to the railroad tracks, and there are cattle cars waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1217">And guards went with us, some of the guards went with us, only up to the camp, and then that is the last time we’ve seen them.</span> <span id="s1218">We n – did not know what we going.</span> <span id="s1219">Now we come to Sachsenhausen, and there is no room for us in Sachsenhausen in the barracks, because there’s more prisoners in – everybody is on the street of the camp, not knowing where I – why and what.</span> <span id="s1220">We find out from the other prisoners who came a little after us, that the Russians are already very close to pole – they are in Poland now.</span> <span id="s1221">They could hear – hear the shots and that’s why they were taken away from there.</span> <span id="s1222">So now we found out why.</span> <span id="s1223">And then, of course, Sachsenhausen is very close to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1224">The Americans and the British were bombing Berlin like crazy.</span> <span id="s1225">And yet, there were still killings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Let me step back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: That’s a r-reasonably long trip, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: I don’t remember exactly how many hours, but say it was – Auschwitz was close to border of – the Czech and German border too.</span> <span id="s1230">I would say five, six, seven hours, maybe longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Oh okay, all right.</span> <span id="s1232">What I was wondering about and what they were asking about is.</span> <span id="s1233">I ha – I realize you’d been at Auschwitz for quite some time at – I mean you – wa – you – was – I’m trying to understand what it was like for you to be leaving and – and to be – have this uncertainty of where you were going, and I mean, to jus –</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Well, we were like robots, it was – first of all, they don’t give you time to think, you couldn’t think.</span> <span id="s1235">Among ourselves we would say, oh my God, where we going?</span> <span id="s1236">Among ourselves.</span> <span id="s1237">Think they’re going to take us to kill us now?</span> <span id="s1238">They – we figure they cleared some – some wooded area, shoot us and that’s the end of us.</span> <span id="s1239">First we thought, if they make a left turn as we marching, gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1240">But they didn’t make a left turn, where we going?</span> <span id="s1241">Pe – cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1242">Now we come to sa – Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1243">We don’t know what we doing here.</span> <span id="s1244">No more slave labor camps, no more slave labor [indecipherable] no – no – no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Did you – we – were you talking amongst yourselves in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Oh sure, sure –</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Cause it seems like –</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: – sc – I went with three of my friends who were my partners.</span> <span id="s1249">One had died in Israel, one died in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1250">Sydler(ph), you have – you got his name on – on the list there, misspelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: That’s why the list is there, so you can afterwards spell them properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: How long did you spent in Sachsenhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: I would say couple weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: What was it like there, aside from being crowded?</span> <span id="s1256">What – what did you do, how –</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Was har-hardly any food.</span> <span id="s1258">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1259">Just walked the camp and slept on the si – in the si – we didn’t sleep inside the barracks, we slept on the – o-on the grounds.</span> <span id="s1260">There was no room for us.</span> <span id="s1261">Dogs and guards, people dying next to you.</span> <span id="s1262">All the – all you tried to do is to take off the – somebody’s jacket so you can be a little warmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: So s – you said it was October?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: October 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: So it was already starting to get cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Then how long were you in – in Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Until March 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: So that’s how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: From end of October –</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: To March –</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: – to March 1945.</span> <span id="s1273">In Landsberg – the only labor that we did over there, we worked the potato fields.</span> <span id="s1274">They had some outside potato, buried potatoes and stuff.</span> <span id="s1275">For the winter they would bury potatoes, you know, they had these potato like – like – like a little grave it looks like, you know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: And we would dig out the potatoes for food.</span> <span id="s1278">And I was one of the fortunate ones, got the job in the potato field and I used to organize potatoes for my – for my friends in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: You mentioned briefly that – that you left Auschwitz with two close friends.</span> <span id="s1280">What happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Okay, one was Jacob Buchler, b-u-a – b-u-c-h-l-e-r, and the other one was Sydler(ph), his name was Pishta(ph) in Slovak.</span> <span id="s1282">And both of these men – I ra – I left them and I ran from – you know.</span> <span id="s1283">Both of these men ended up in Slovakia, back in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1284">Sydler(ph) ended up in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1285">Buchler went back to our hometown, which is called Topol’čany.</span> <span id="s1286">Buchler and his nephew, and – and his sister, some – some of them that survived, ended up in 1948 in Israel.</span> <span id="s1287">In 1981 my wife Agnes and I went to the first gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel, June 11th, 1981.</span> <span id="s1288">I did not see Buchler, I spoke to him on the phone.</span> <span id="s1289">He, for some reason couldn’t make it, he was not feeling well, and we were talking.</span> <span id="s1290">That’s the last time I spoke to him and then he died in ’85.</span> <span id="s1291">However, his nephew, whose name is Robert, or Yehasure(ph) Buchler became a historian, went to schools, and as a matter of fact, I just seen him last week in Israel.</span> <span id="s1292">I’ve got a book here with me which is in Slovak about our hometown.</span> <span id="s1293">Every member of that community of my city is – that was murdered by the Nazis, including my family, is listed in this book.</span> <span id="s1294">The other man, Sydler(ph) ended up in Bratislava, worked there for awhile.</span> <span id="s1295">I’ve got letters from him at home now.</span> <span id="s1296">He – only thing he wanted to do, we should meet and go together back to Auschwitz and then go and beat every Pollack in the – in – in the streets.</span> <span id="s1297">That’s what he writes in the Slovak letter.</span> <span id="s1298">And unfortunately, he wasn’t well when he left Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1299">He – he was quite ill, and he died quite young.</span> <span id="s1300">I would say he died before 1970.</span> <span id="s1301">Oh, hell yes, before 1970 because in 1964, I – I lived in Michigan City, that’s the last I heard from him.</span> <span id="s1302">Indiana.</span> <span id="s1303">And so, he died there, in Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: You talk about not being able to cry in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1305">“You Cried, You Died,” the – the film you mentioned.</span> <span id="s1306">What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Well, you see, if you showed weakness to the Nazis, they liked that.</span> <span id="s1308">They killed you for – for it even easier.</span> <span id="s1309">But if you showed that you were – still had a little – little gutsy strength in you, they – they respected that a little better, if you can call it respect.</span> <span id="s1310">You know, they – the – this guy I testified against, Hans Kunneman(ph), Heinrich Kunneman(ph), he had the expression, when he would see you after so many weeks, after week he sees you, you’re still alive, you’re still working, you’re still striving, he would greet you, Du alter bandit, du lebs noch.</span> <span id="s1311">You old bandit, are you still alive?</span> <span id="s1312">And he said it with such a respect that you still fought the system, that you still survived the system, see?</span> <span id="s1313">So, if you showed crying, you might as well lay down and die.</span> <span id="s1314">I couldn’t cry for my father.</span> <span id="s1315">First time I was able to cry for him, it was January 27, 1985, when I took my two children with me, when I showed them the window which I seen my fa – my father from – through, on the barrack that he was taken.</span> <span id="s1316">Took me a long time.</span> <span id="s1317">When I said Kaddish over there for my father in front of that window, that’s when I broke down and cried for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Do you remember the first time you were able to cry at all when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: When I came to this country?</span> <span id="s1320">When my daughter got engaged to be married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: That was the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: That was the first time.</span> <span id="s1323">I couldn’t – I couldn’t cry.</span> <span id="s1324">Every once in awhile when I speak now, and the question comes out s – a little stronger than – a little more personal, about my parents, about my father, about my sisters, about my mother, once in awhile I hold back the tears and – I cried last week in Israel.</span> <span id="s1325">Now, here’s why I cried last week in Israel.</span> <span id="s1326">I was asked by the Jewish Welfare Federation of Indianapolis, when we go to the – with the family mission to Israel, when we get to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial, would I be willing to address my group, the fellow – fellow – the travelers with me, at Yad Vashem, and I agreed to do so.</span> <span id="s1327">Not only did I address them, but I also got my friend, this Buchler, the historian to meet me there, he teaches there at the – at the Holocaust memorial.</span> <span id="s1328">And he told the group how I saved his life at Auschwitz, and that mi – made – made me – well, I broke down and cried.</span> <span id="s1329">Took me a little while to calm down and tell my story after he left.</span> <span id="s1330">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Do you ever – once you started – when your daughter got engaged, was it any easier, thereafter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1333">It’s – it’s – it gets a little easier after you let it – let it loose, let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Cause that’s quite a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Yes, ’81. ’</span> <span id="s1336">81.</span> <span id="s1337">I don’t remember crying after – oh, maybe I – in my dreams maybe, I know when I have some bad nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Can – what are your dreams like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Most of the time I try to make them pleasant, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: The bad dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: The bad ones.</span> <span id="s1342">The bad ones is Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Are there particular images that reoccur?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: See the faces.</span> <span id="s1345">The faces of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1346">I can see every one of them.</span> <span id="s1347">I can see them when I’m talking to you now.</span> <span id="s1348">I can see the faces on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1349">I can see Mengele as clear as day.</span> <span id="s1350">I’ll never forget the beatings.</span> <span id="s1351">The 25 on your behind if they caught you with organizing food for other prisoners.</span> <span id="s1352">As you were carrying the bundles of clothing to the women prisoners who did the cleaning and disinfecting of the clothes, and all of a sudden the cane crook – the handle of the cane is behind your neck, and your neck and he pulls you down, he drops you, you drop your bundle and he pokes with that stick in the – in there, in the clothes and he finds some food and he – before you even turn around he smacks you right over the head with the cane, and he would ask, to what Jewish sow are you taking this?</span> <span id="s1353">And of course, if you tell, the Jewish girl is in trouble.</span> <span id="s1354">If you don’t tell, bend over, 25 on your behind.</span> <span id="s1355">And you got to count.</span> <span id="s1356">You count and he stops you.</span> <span id="s1357">How many did I give you?</span> <span id="s1358">17.</span> <span id="s1359">Wrong, all over again.</span> <span id="s1360">By the time he st-starts all over again you already fainted, you’re already gone.</span> <span id="s1361">So those are the things.</span> <span id="s1362">I’ve got marks on my – on my – below my belt now which never will go away.</span> <span id="s1363">I’ve got a mark on my neck right here from a shovel by a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1364">They didn’t – life meant nothing to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: You know I – when I was getting ready to leave to come here, I was talking to a friend of mine and she said, would you ask him for me – that would be you – were there any moments of humanity?</span> <span id="s1366">Were there any guards or anybody that worked at the camp, any of them that had little pockets of humanity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Tell her that’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s1368">The work that we did, the Kanada commando, unloading incoming Jews and then, after the Nazis sorted them, selected them, you die now, you die later, then we start working with the belongings, with the artifacts.</span> <span id="s1369">And among the artifacts is all sorts of watches, diamonds, rings, jewelry, because that was all confiscated.</span> <span id="s1370">There were boxes for this merchandise, for these items.</span> <span id="s1371">And the Nazis would march back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s1372">They were not allowed to bend down and pick anything up.</span> <span id="s1373">But a Nazi would see a watch and he tells you, take that watch and take it to the latrine with you.</span> <span id="s1374">And he would march you – with you – behind you towards the men’s latrine.</span> <span id="s1375">And you squat, as you got this watch in your pocket and you throw it to him on the ground.</span> <span id="s1376">He takes off his rifle and with his rifle head he picks up the piece.</span> <span id="s1377">So he’s good to you for – for a day or so.</span> <span id="s1378">But as far as compassion, as far as any feeling towards you, the only compassion feeling if they could benefit, because they cou – they – they were all on the take.</span> <span id="s1379">They all knew how.</span> <span id="s1380">Everyone – every Nazi had their own prisoners who would organize for them.</span> <span id="s1381">So they took care of you for awhile.</span> <span id="s1382">But if he sees his superior coming towards you, regardless of what you gave him, he beat you just the same.</span> <span id="s1383">So the compassion wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1384">They had no compassion, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1385">Yeah, there were some people that – I know of – of a guy who knew a Nazi from his hometown, and he was the worst animal to him.</span> <span id="s1386">So there’s – there was s – there was some of them that would throw me a piece of bread only because you dealt with them, only because you gave them something.</span> <span id="s1387">And they let you organize.</span> <span id="s1388">They turned their backs so you could eat.</span> <span id="s1389">You know, turn their head and – and – an-and – and – and turn your – turn away so they couldn’t – they wouldn’t see it, because if they seen it, they have to beat you.</span> <span id="s1390">They knew we were eating, because they needed our hands at the railroad tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Have you ever had – I think I know the answer to this, but have you ever had an opportunity t-to ever since the war, talk to anybody on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: What side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Any of the guards, any of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Just in the trials.</span> <span id="s1395">No-Not directly to them, through their attorneys, yes.</span> <span id="s1396">We accuse them of – of things that they did.</span> <span id="s1397">As far as per – one on one, no, never met anyone.</span> <span id="s1398">I may have met some, but I did – you know, may have been one, but I didn’t know who they were, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: If you had that opportunity, would you take it?</span> <span id="s1400">A: Yes, definitely would.</span> <span id="s1401">And I wouldn’t do it with hate.</span> <span id="s1402">I wouldn’t do it with hate.</span> <span id="s1403">Conversation.</span> <span id="s1404">I was asked to go on a program once and – and – with – with these – the hate group, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: The clan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: No, clan and also th-the – the white supremists(ph) to go on – what do you – what do you call that guy who – who was fighting on the – he had a fight – fighting do – talk show?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Maury Povich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Oh, Geraldo Rivera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Geraldo Rivera.</span> <span id="s1411">I got a call from his – from his show to come on with – with two, one supremist(ph) and – from a ri-ri-ridge – from that ridge place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Ruby Ridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Ruby Ridge, and – and a – and a clan guy to go – are you nuts?</span> <span id="s1414">I want to go on that program with these animals?</span> <span id="s1415">First of all I wouldn’t go on his show.</span> <span id="s1416">Geraldo Rivera is not my person.</span> <span id="s1417">That’s not my kind of show, not my kind of people.</span> <span id="s1418">And he’s half Jewish, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: I know, I was about to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: No, that’s not me, no.</span> <span id="s1421">But I would go one on one, or I would go two on one.</span> <span id="s1422">I’ll be one, they’ll be two.</span> <span id="s1423">Let their t-tell their story.</span> <span id="s1424">Let me tell you – this may not come – this has nothing to do with this question.</span> <span id="s1425">I have a friend who is a president of PBS in Richmond, Virginia, okay?</span> <span id="s1426">He name is Charles Sidna(ph), Jr., historian on Nazism.</span> <span id="s1427">Wrote a couple of books on SS.</span> <span id="s1428">I met him the first time in 1990 in Honolulu.</span> <span id="s1429">Last October he went to Germany and Austria with a number of historians for his ta – conference on Nazi German – Nazi German Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1945.</span> <span id="s1430">Among them was also an SS guard, SS person who a – who was in there with him in the group.</span> <span id="s1431">And here they are, they – there was a exhibit traveling to Germany, and there was very much – a lot of protest against that exhibit in Germany.</span> <span id="s1432">But they were there and talking, each one had their own – own – the work.</span> <span id="s1433">You know, one – one was on the Greek Jews, one was on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: A specialty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Special – sp – oh – own specialty, see, thanks.</span> <span id="s1436">Also there was an Israeli boy who I met last week, my – from my hometown.</span> <span id="s1437">He too was there, okay?</span> <span id="s1438">He is a historian from Israel.</span> <span id="s1439">So he was the only Jew, there was a guy from Czech Republic, there was a guy from Poland, there was a guy from Austria, there was number of ca – people from Germany, and they were talking.</span> <span id="s1440">And they were demonstrating against him.</span> <span id="s1441">Some German took a canister of salt and threw it through the window ins – in the building with a sign, here is your Zyklon B gas.</span> <span id="s1442">That’s – that happened last fall, okay?</span> <span id="s1443">So my friend from Richmond, Virginia, the president of PBS, who made a film on me by the way, called “65316” and c – he calls me up and tells me what happened, and he also told me that he was there with an Israeli guy and he asked him where he is from, he told him from Slovakia and from where, from the s – my hometown.</span> <span id="s1444">And he says to him, I know a guy from that town, too – my friend from Richmond told him.</span> <span id="s1445">He says, he lives in the States.</span> <span id="s1446">So the guy says, I know who, Mike Vogel.</span> <span id="s1447">Mike Vogel saved my life at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1448">That’s the guy I told you about.</span> <span id="s1449">So here’s a guy, pitches salt, grain of salt like Zyklon B gas into these people.</span> <span id="s1450">So you see, Nazism, some of these animals, when – when someone shows, “Hitler’s Willing Executioners,” or someone goes there for this type of a purpose, they’re still fighting it.</span> <span id="s1451">They never admit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Now, I – I asked your wife about this yesterday.</span> <span id="s1453">Have you had encounters – cause – cause you’ve gone back to germ – you’ve gone to Germany several times –</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: – to testify.</span> <span id="s1456">Have you had the opportunity to meet younger Germans –</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: – who were not alive then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1460">I meet younger Germans not only in Germany, but I also meet them here, in this country.</span> <span id="s1461">Students, c-college students, graduate students.</span> <span id="s1462">And the question always comes, do I hate all Germans?</span> <span id="s1463">Well, I said, I don’t hate all Germans.</span> <span id="s1464">However, all Germans my age and older, and some even younger were responsible for the atrocities that happened to us, that – that was done to us.</span> <span id="s1465">Even if they themselves did – were not involved in throwing us into the ovens, but they were part of the process, part of the organization, part of the hate, part of the people that killed us.</span> <span id="s1466">However you, as a young German, I can’t hold you responsible for the atrocity that happened to us – done to us by a – by your grandparents.</span> <span id="s1467">But when you go back home, ask your parents, if they were old enough, or your grandparents, what did they do from 1933 to 1945?</span> <span id="s1468">What did they do to stop the atrocities?</span> <span id="s1469">What did they do to stop Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s1470">What did they do to stop deportation?</span> <span id="s1471">What did they do to stop taking away Jewish shops and Jewish businesses?</span> <span id="s1472">What did they do to burn Jewish temples?</span> <span id="s1473">This is what you got to ask their parents, your parents and grandparents.</span> <span id="s1474">But as far as hating you, I don’t even hate your parents, let alone you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: I have a dif – perhaps a difficult question.</span> <span id="s1476">I’m sure you’ve heard all these questions at one time or another.</span> <span id="s1477">Have you ever pondered if by a twist of fate you were not born Jewish, but you were born German, or you were a Gentile Slovak in your hometown –</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Have you ever pondered how you would have behaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: You know, I never thought about that, but I probably would have been the same as the rest of them.</span> <span id="s1481">I probably would have been same as the rest of them, because it was inbred in them.</span> <span id="s1482">It would be inbred in me – inbred-ed in me, because as much as these Slovaks or Hungarians or Poles worked with Jews, worked for Jews or benefited by Jews or whatever, they were partners with them, or they were – they were part of their operation, they all were anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1483">And I probably would have been one of them.</span> <span id="s1484">I grew up in it.</span> <span id="s1485">You know, I referee soccer in Indianapolis in the state of Indiana.</span> <span id="s1486">There’s a German man named Hans Gut, came to this country in the 50’s with his father.</span> <span id="s1487">And Hans is in his 50’s now, or better.</span> <span id="s1488">“Auschwitz, If You Cried You Died,” was showing the first time in Indianapolis.</span> <span id="s1489">It was shown nationally, but it was shown in Indianapolis that time, too.</span> <span id="s1490">I went to do a high school soccer game and Hans Gut was also one of their – one of – we were three referee – three – three people.</span> <span id="s1491">There’s two linesmen and a – and a – and a referee.</span> <span id="s1492">And I was scheduled to do the game and Hans is getting out of his car and I’m getting out of my car from the park – school parking lot, we walked to the soccer field.</span> <span id="s1493">And Hans Gut says to me, Mike, I’ve seen your film last night.</span> <span id="s1494">But don’t you think it’s about time to stop this?</span> <span id="s1495">Isn’t that enough of blasting, basting the Germans, of constantly – constantly – he says to me, my father was also in the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1496">He says, he wa – he too suffered.</span> <span id="s1497">I said, well Hans, let me tell you a little bit about my father.</span> <span id="s1498">Your father was in Russian front.</span> <span id="s1499">He had the guns, ammunition, clothes, boots.</span> <span id="s1500">He was dressed.</span> <span id="s1501">My father was stripped naked, stripped from his dignity, totally dehumanized, taken to the gas chambers, starved – first starved, tortured.</span> <span id="s1502">I said, my father didn’t have a gun to turn around and shoot his – shoot people who were putting him in the ovens.</span> <span id="s1503">Your father didn’t have to join the army.</span> <span id="s1504">My father was forced into go in the concentration camp and be killed.</span> <span id="s1505">So what are you giving me this bullcrap about your father?</span> <span id="s1506">So you see, people don’t want to see, the people don’t want to hear.</span> <span id="s1507">And especially German people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: I – I s – I saw a television documentary about certain Gentiles that had hidden Jewish families –</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: – during the – the war.</span> <span id="s1511">And one of the survivors who had been hidden by this Gentile man said, if it had been me, I wouldn’t have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: He wouldn’t have saved him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: That’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: He s – he said, I wouldn’t have put my family at risk that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: He said, so I don’t understand this man who did this thing, who – who caused me to live and my family to live, and – you know, so now that I can have children of my own.</span> <span id="s1518">I’m glad he did it, but I don’t think I would have done it if I were him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Mm, well, he’s right.</span> <span id="s1520">Not too many did it, cause if there were so many Righteous Gentiles, why else – if there were so many, why so many of us died, why so many was killed.</span> <span id="s1521">Let me tell you my own personal experiment – experience with what you just asked me.</span> <span id="s1522">First part of 1942, I was in a slave labor camp in Slovakia called Nováky.</span> <span id="s1523">There was a good friend of mine whose name was Josef Knap(ph), Kanap(ph) in Slovak, Knap(ph).</span> <span id="s1524">Josef Knap(ph) had a Christian girlfriend, name was Terri(ph) – Therese – ter – terra – terries – Th-Therese.</span> <span id="s1525">Him and I escaped together from Nováky.</span> <span id="s1526">He knew his way pretty well, he was about a year and a half older than me.</span> <span id="s1527">We get to our hometown, Topol’čany, his – her father had a small farm on the outskirts of our city and we two boys, escapees, going the back doors, back ways so we will get picked up by this – by the gendarmes, by the police of our town.</span> <span id="s1528">Came to this house hoping that I would be able to hide there too.</span> <span id="s1529">Well, the father of the girl, father of Therese, the father said, I’m taking Josef in my house and hide him, but I’m not taking a chance with two Jews in my house.</span> <span id="s1530">And here I am, stuck out on the outskirt of our town, got picked up by police as I was walking back to town, beat the hell out of me, send me back to Nováky.</span> <span id="s1531">In 1946 I went back to Slovakia wi – through the army because I went to get my papers and those two are still married, of course, they had a child.</span> <span id="s1532">And she cried.</span> <span id="s1533">She apologized to me that her father wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1534">Her father died since, but he wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1535">So – but as fate would have it, I survived, she says, so at least I came to see them.</span> <span id="s1536">Josef Knap(ph) died, let’s see, 1990 I was in Israel and there was a Czechoslovakian gathering of Holocaust survivors, and there was another Jew – Jewish person there who travels from – to my hometown and he told me that he died a few months ago.</span> <span id="s1537">So the Righteous Gentiles really weren’t that many.</span> <span id="s1538">As far as the guy said he wouldn’t do it, I believe it, because most people didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s1539">My father had enough Christian friends and people that he dealt with, people that he sold horses and cattle to, that somebody could have saved us.</span> <span id="s1540">Nobody was willing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: You earlier were talking about, when I was asking about anger, you were saying that i-i – I’m paraphrasing, that most of your anger is directed at the fact that you made it and your – your siblings and your parents didn’t.</span> <span id="s1542">I – I – that classic thing that is talked about with survivors is guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: You know, why did I make it and other people didn’t.</span> <span id="s1545">Would you call that guilt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: It’s guilt, yeah, it’s guilt.</span> <span id="s1547">You know, people would also pul – ge – put guilt – guilt on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: When I – ’46 when I went to my hometown, was a small Jewish community left that came back, and th – some that were hidden.</span> <span id="s1550">You know, how did you make it and my parents didn’t, my sisters and brothers didn’t?</span> <span id="s1551">Why – what – why should you be the lucky one, and not – not – I – why shouldn’t I have my brother or sister here?</span> <span id="s1552">I had nobody left, and they’re still putting – put the guilt on me.</span> <span id="s1553">So they – the people put guilt on us.</span> <span id="s1554">You know, at first I was even afraid to speak about it.</span> <span id="s1555">Here I am, survived the camps and nobody else did – did it in my family, so why should I be guilty that I survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: So you were afraid that by talking about it people would – it would beg the question –</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Would make the questions, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: – how come you made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: How come your – your not dead, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Hold on for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel.</span> <span id="s1563">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1564">You mentioned this trial that happened while you were living in Detroit that your friend Kulka or -- Kulka is that – did I get that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Yeah, which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: I-In the – in the – in the tr – video interview, you mentioned in passing that when you were living in Detroit – maybe this is incorrect or they got confused, you were in the midst of telling a story about while you were living in Detroit and then you interspersed into that, or interpolated into that, talking about a trial that this fellow, Eric Kulka was involved with, and I think it confused the Holocaust Museum people, whether that was a trial that happened while you were living in Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: While I was living in Detroit.</span> <span id="s1568">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1569">This was – actually, I was not living in Detroit any more, I was living in the States.</span> <span id="s1570">This trial was in Germany, okay?</span> <span id="s1571">And Kulka was part of the trial and so was Joe Neumann(ph) – Josef Neumann(ph), Joe Neumann(ph).</span> <span id="s1572">The trial was held in Frankfurt against a former Nazi, and I don’t remember which one it was.</span> <span id="s1573">It was also photograph brought there and there’s a photograph of me in – taken by the Nazi documentation department.</span> <span id="s1574">And – and that photograph was used as evidence.</span> <span id="s1575">Is that what they want to know, is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: They were just wondering about th-the – whether, you know, they were unclear what that trial was and whether it was happening in Detroit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Trial was done in Frankfurt, Germany.</span> <span id="s1580">This was one of the first trials of – of Nazi trials.</span> <span id="s1581">This was later than Detroit, you know, I was not living in Detroit, I was – that was not Detroit, because I didn’t know about Kulka in Detroit yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1584">This was the trial in Germany against the former Nazi guard, Nazi – a Nazi guard.</span> <span id="s1585">That was in Germany, and this photograph which I have – which Kulka by the way, gave me in 1981 in Israel, copy of it, this was used as evidence, this photograph, identifying the prisoners that were a – in that photographs.</span> <span id="s1586">Je – Holocaust Museum has the photograph.</span> <span id="s1587">They have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Did you – you’ve already told me how you felt about Nuremberg, that you felt it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Mm, a farce.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: A farce.</span> <span id="s1591">How much did you follow the various postwar trials that occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Well, the trial that I really followed, the first one I have tried – I followed was Eichmann trial.</span> <span id="s1593">That to me was the trial to be watched.</span> <span id="s1594">And yet, to the last minute the guy didn’t admit to anything.</span> <span id="s1595">And he was the mastermind of the railroad tracks of the ca – of the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1596">He was the guy who – who – who had another guy, Dieter Wisliceny who was – who he – he sent to Slovakia to – to get us out of there, who he sent to Greece to get the Greek Jews.</span> <span id="s1597">And – and – and this man to the last moment did not admit – only thing he said, I followed orders.</span> <span id="s1598">And as far as Eichmann’s capture, it wasn’t done because of Simon Wiesenthal, it was done because of the Israeli Mossad.</span> <span id="s1599">And Simon Wiesenthal want – took it – the credit for that, but it is no longer the credit for – he doesn’t take it any more, I’m sure of it.</span> <span id="s1600">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: When you – jumping around here a bit –</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Prior to when you talked at your daughter’s school –</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: – during that large gap of time prior to that, that you lived in this country, and after you were close with this group of survivors in Detroit when you first came over –</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: – did you talk – how often would this ever come up with friends, coworkers, colleagues?</span> <span id="s1608">I mean, you have the tattoo –</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: You mean – oh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: – people asking you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Oh sure, people would ask about the tattoo, of course.</span> <span id="s1612">I used to make kind of fun of it, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1613">This is my telephone number, this is my house address, which by the way, becomes my home – home address now, because when I bought this house – when I – when we were moving here 30 years ago, looking for a home and the real estate lady takes me in this neighborhood and I see a address, 6531.</span> <span id="s1614">My number is 65316.</span> <span id="s1615">I said, we’re going to buy this house.</span> <span id="s1616">My wife says, you gotta be crazy.</span> <span id="s1617">I says why?</span> <span id="s1618">I never – I – I can never lose my – if I lose my way I know I got it on my arm, you know, I said – no, she says, don’t – don’t – let’s not buy this house.</span> <span id="s1619">I – so we bought it anyway, you know.</span> <span id="s1620">So that’s a sick sense of humor in me, you know.</span> <span id="s1621">I bought the house only – not only because it was a good price, but it also had a right number.</span> <span id="s1622">So coworkers, yeah, they always ask.</span> <span id="s1623">Not co – s-strangers on the street, in a restaurant, when it’s summertime you go there in a short sleeve shirt.</span> <span id="s1624">They look at you first and they don’t want to say anything, they’re kind of you know.</span> <span id="s1625">And what am I gonna do, cover it like this?</span> <span id="s1626">No.</span> <span id="s1627">So – you were in one of them camps, huh?</span> <span id="s1628">Ye – wa – wa – one of them bad Nazi camps, huh?</span> <span id="s1629">And I, oh yeah, I says.</span> <span id="s1630">Could you tell me a little bit about it?</span> <span id="s1631">I says no, not in a restaurant, you know.</span> <span id="s1632">You got children in school, I said, we have a film over there.</span> <span id="s1633">Or wa – you – ever go here, you can find out.</span> <span id="s1634">You go to the children’s museum, they have s-stuff on the Holocaust, you know.</span> <span id="s1635">So th-that – that always comes up, always, there isn’t – I tho – there isn’t a day when somebody doesn’t stare at you when you have the number exposed.</span> <span id="s1636">I’ll tell you another story.</span> <span id="s1637">In 1961 we lived in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span id="s1638">I was working for a company called Shoppers Fair.</span> <span id="s1639">I was straightening out a couple of shelves in the store with my sleeves – short sleeve shirt on.</span> <span id="s1640">A guy walks in, he says, you got number.</span> <span id="s1641">I know man got number.</span> <span id="s1642">Talks with an accent.</span> <span id="s1643">I said oh yeah, you do?</span> <span id="s1644">Okay.</span> <span id="s1645">I bring him here.</span> <span id="s1646">Next day he drags in a gu – brings in a guy, we were together in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1647">This guy’s name was Mutti(ph) Klein(ph).</span> <span id="s1648">He worked with my father with the horses at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1649">We became f – of course, close friends until we moved to Cleveland, he – they – a-and – and he eva – a-a-after awhile he got a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1650">Then he retired in Florida.</span> <span id="s1651">In 1990 we went to Israel ag-again for the gathering, and he didn't make it because he was ill.</span> <span id="s1652">And there I met some people that know him also because they came the same time as we did to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1653">We got home to Indianapolis, we found out a few months later he died.</span> <span id="s1654">So that was also through his number because the guy seen me at work, stocking shelves at Shoppers Fair.</span> <span id="s1655">So the number is always there and always comes up in the conversation wherever I go.</span> <span id="s1656">And when I went to Germany to test – testify, I made it a point when we were free from court, and we went for train rides and went – anywhere we went, I would always [indecipherable] summertime, of course we were there summertime, I would sit there – and always would like to sit close to an older German, just to let him see the number.</span> <span id="s1657">And they would look at you, then they put the head down and never look at you again.</span> <span id="s1658">Probably couldn't get a – couldn’t – couldn’t wait to get off the next stop.</span> <span id="s1659">Yeah, the number is there unfortunately and it’ll stay there as long as I live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: You talk – you’ve talked quite a bit about this gathering in 1981.</span> <span id="s1661">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: This was the most – fir – first of all it was the first gathering ever, okay?</span> <span id="s1663">This was the most emotional four or five days we had in Israel.</span> <span id="s1664">We had a survivor village in – in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1665">There were computers set up all over the creation – all over the place and every one of us was listed in the computer, who we were, where we came from.</span> <span id="s1666">And this is how I met in person, Eric Kulka.</span> <span id="s1667">I didn’t know – first of all, I didn’t know Eric Kulka.</span> <span id="s1668">I didn’t know who Eric Kulka was.</span> <span id="s1669">I get a message at the Hilton Jerusalem, note Eric Kulka, telephone number.</span> <span id="s1670">Call up Eric Kulka and he tells me who he is.</span> <span id="s1671">Eric Kulka’s wife was murdered by the Nazis, so what he did, he took his wife’s maiden name and changed his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: In tribute?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: In – yeah, in – in tribute for his wife, yeah.</span> <span id="s1674">He’s got a son who teaches at the University of Jerusalem, also a historian and a writer of books.</span> <span id="s1675">So Eric died, I was told the other day, last week, year and a half ago.</span> <span id="s1676">Kidney failure.</span> <span id="s1677">But he was much older than me, Eric was in his late 80’s.</span> <span id="s1678">I also saved his life, yeah.</span> <span id="s1679">But Eric was quite a guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Have you been to the museum – you’ve been to the museum in D.C.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: A number of times, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: What was that like the first time you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Well, the first time I went there was for the opening when – when the – when it was the g – the grand opening of the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1684">That was in April 1993.</span> <span id="s1685">The coldest, rainiest day you can imagine, it was so cold.</span> <span id="s1686">And we – we said, it fits the occasion, the oc – the opening fits the occasion.</span> <span id="s1687">Three of our kids came with us, two daughters and a son and my wife and I. And I was written up in the U.S. – the U.S.A. today in the – because of the opening.</span> <span id="s1688">And this was too, very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s1689">The – the – the – the demonstrators, they – the park police, of course, took care of them after awhile.</span> <span id="s1690">They had demonstrators up to a point and after that they took care of them.</span> <span id="s1691">The-They blocked them off with buses, they could – you couldn’t see them any more.</span> <span id="s1692">And of course, it was so emotional.</span> <span id="s1693">But the ’81 in Israel, that is where I met Kulka and met some other people, a couple guys from France who worked with me in the Kanada commando.</span> <span id="s1694">And then – that was the hardest part.</span> <span id="s1695">That was the – that was the hardest part for me.</span> <span id="s1696">When at Yad Vashem we heard a first speech by a – the le – one of the leaders of the group, and man there wasn’t a dry eye in the place.</span> <span id="s1697">This is when I really cried, when they start talking, my number is such and such.</span> <span id="s1698">And then you walked through the Yad Vashem Museum where all the photographs of – original photographs of Nazis that t – took – the documentation, Nazi documentation took.</span> <span id="s1699">As I walked through, I’ve seen the railroad tracks where I worked.</span> <span id="s1700">And I’ve seen the prisoners whom I knew and I point – could point out who they were.</span> <span id="s1701">And that broke me down.</span> <span id="s1702">And NPR was there, she interviewed me, a lady interviewed me, I couldn’t finish the interview, that’s how bad I was.</span> <span id="s1703">That was very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s1704">And we went – since then, of course, we went to a few more gathering – Holocaust gathering.</span> <span id="s1705">I had the great honor, because of the Holocaust Museum and the Holocaust organization, May eighth, this past May eighth, be invited to Washington, D.C. at the capital rotunda to do the Holocaust Memorial Kaddish.</span> <span id="s1706">So I did May eighth in Washington, which was also very beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: So le-let me ask you a question about your faith.</span> <span id="s1708">You – we’ve talked about your problems with God.</span> <span id="s1709">I – I gather from talking to you and to your wife that you were less than enthusiastic about raising your children in an observant home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: And – and yet, you say the Kaddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: And – and yet, th – you said the Kaddish –</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: – and that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: – is meaningful to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Are you – how can I phrase the question?</span> <span id="s1720">Have you become any more comfortable or interested, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: The last few years, last few years I – I’m – I go to the temples Friday nights.</span> <span id="s1722">I’m still a little thinking about it, just what am I doing here, but yet I feel I must do it now, especially now.</span> <span id="s1723">I’m getting older and it’s time to identify myself more, not just by name, but also by attending the services, hoping to heal a little different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Is it helping?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Yes, I think it’s helping.</span> <span id="s1726">I think it’s helping because the community knows me so well now and they identify me with this.</span> <span id="s1727">The Jewish community relations which I am a chairman of the Holocaust Committee here in t – in our organization, and anytime something happens, they call on me.</span> <span id="s1728">At the state capital rotunda here, I was asked to speak, als – May sixth, two days before Washington.</span> <span id="s1729">They wanted to also make it May eighth, I said, I’m sorry, I can’t attend it, you have to get someone else.</span> <span id="s1730">No, we don’t want someone else, we want you.</span> <span id="s1731">So we make it on May sixth.</span> <span id="s1732">So they made it on May sixth and there too I spoke, and I was asked by the community to do the holoc – to do the Kaddish for the ser-service.</span> <span id="s1733">So the community is kind of pushing me towards this sort of a making me part of – the Holocaust Jew to be the spokesperson.</span> <span id="s1734">Any time they need someone, newspapers here, local papers, the television channels – there isn’t a television program on Holocaust that I’m not involved in that they don’t call me.</span> <span id="s1735">When Shpindler – “Schindler’s List” was shown, I was asked to be on the program.</span> <span id="s1736">Yom HaShoah comes around, the Day of Remembrance, I am asked to be on programs.</span> <span id="s1737">So I’m – now I feel I’m coming back to my roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Do you ever wish that you were not born Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: No.</span> <span id="s1740">No, no, never.</span> <span id="s1741">I am proud of my heritage, but I – the only problem I had was God and I think I’m healing a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: One of the things that they wanted me to talk to you about is y-your observations of what has been going on in the world surrounding you since you’ve been back –</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: – from Europe, since you’ve been in this country.</span> <span id="s1745">Through the lens of one who has had the experiences that you have had in the Holocaust, and I’m wondering – I’ll ask you about a few things –</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: – you – I think you overheard me talking to your wife about this yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Well, in a general way let me ask you what – what fears do you continue to have here?</span> <span id="s1750">I don’t mean fear of water, fear of dentists, but fears for this country, fears for – worries about hate groups –</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: – political fringes, religious groups –</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Well, the hate groups is one of them.</span> <span id="s1754">You see, the First Amendment in this country is a beautiful item, but the First Amendment should stop somewhere.</span> <span id="s1755">It should stop with these hate groups, it should stop with the – with the KKK, they shouldn’t have their rights with the First Amendment, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1756">Neither should have the skinheads and the white supremists shouldn’t have that, the racists shouldn’t have that, the anti-Semites shouldn’t have that, they shouldn’t have the First Amend – that should – that has nothing to do with the First Amendment.</span> <span id="s1757">You may na – disagree with me, but these are – there’s just got to be stop somewhere.</span> <span id="s1758">Well, here is a guy who has got First Amendment rights, he killed 160 people in – in Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s1759">This is the First Amendment.</span> <span id="s1760">He shouldn’t be even tried.</span> <span id="s1761">He should be given to the people in Oklahoma City and they should take care of it.</span> <span id="s1762">That’s – may sound cruel, but look how cruel he was.</span> <span id="s1763">So these are the fears I have, that because of our freedom in our ri – lives, we let all these groups do whatever they want to do and they murder, then we put them to death row and they stay there for 15 years and 16 times they say – th-the governor says a – a stay of execution and they stay, he goes back there and you feed him and you spend money on him.</span> <span id="s1764">These – these are fears I have.</span> <span id="s1765">I have fears of these hate groups.</span> <span id="s1766">I have fears of all these – all these anti-Semites, all these racists.</span> <span id="s1767">You know, this is what – this is what scares me, this – this is – and now wa – why does it scare me so much?</span> <span id="s1768">Because all you got to have, all you need, God forbid, is bad economy.</span> <span id="s1769">These are the people that will lead the other middle America, and middle America is a na – dangerous world, believe me.</span> <span id="s1770">I’ve seen them, I-I’ve seen them in action, you know, doing my – sometime my – some my speeches, I – sometime I get these middle Americans in there too.</span> <span id="s1771">But these are the ones you’ve got to be careful with.</span> <span id="s1772">The fundamentalists, the middle America.</span> <span id="s1773">The ones who push the ji – push their religions onto you.</span> <span id="s1774">These are the ones that you worry about.</span> <span id="s1775">The white – white supremists, who are they?</span> <span id="s1776">They come from the churches.</span> <span id="s1777">What – lot of them.</span> <span id="s1778">Th-They – they all God loving, Christ fearing white Anglo-Saxon Americans.</span> <span id="s1779">And these are the ones that can lead the mili – militia that can lead this country into ruin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: When you say middle America, what are you referring to?</span> <span id="s1781">That’s a kind of a vague –</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: I’m referring to the – the white supremist, that they call themselves the middle s -- pure Americans.</span> <span id="s1783">If you black you have no business to live in their neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1784">If you Jew, you – your – you’re a bloodsucker.</span> <span id="s1785">If you’re an Asian, if you’re any – any – any of these Asian countries, they hate you.</span> <span id="s1786">Look what’s happened in – happened in New York, all these p – all these poor Koreans or – or – or Asians are working their – every member in the family is working in their little grocery store trying to eke out a living, working, 24 hours a day open and they try to make a living and yet these – these – these animals, the whites beat the hell out of them.</span> <span id="s1787">And – and their some – so do some – some blacks do the same thing to them, it was a ca – it’s happened there was the blacks that came after them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Have you been any more concerned in the recent past than in the decades previous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Yes, because it’s – now we have the news media that keeps bringing it – bringing the – all these atrocities up, brings – bringing the news up, which we didn’t have in the past like we have it today.</span> <span id="s1790">I wish we had the news media during my time in Auschwitz, before Auschwitz, probably wouldn’t have been – I – I – I don’t know, if you had CNN then, who knows what would happen.</span> <span id="s1791">But the – but it wasn’t as bad in years back.</span> <span id="s1792">Years back, yes, there was anti-Semitism, racism and all [indecipherable] I’m – I’m afraid always will be anti-Semitism and racism as far as – as long as we have this kind of a population as we have here, the – the – the – and middle America that loves the pure white people.</span> <span id="s1793">So – but that scares me, it scares me that if ano – be another Holocaust, that can be a lot of troubles, that can create a lot of problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: What should we do to ward that off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Indifference and education.</span> <span id="s1796">Indifference, teaching people what indifference means, stands for.</span> <span id="s1797">Indifference, don’t look at me that I’m dark eyed and brow-brown hair and dark skin, look at me as a person, that I’m your neighbor, that I’m your citizen, I’m the same citizen as you are, and don’t put the hate on me because of what I am, what I was born.</span> <span id="s1798">That’s the indifference.</span> <span id="s1799">Education, teach these people what can happen when hate and racism and anti-Semitism flourishes.</span> <span id="s1800">What can happen when poor economy can bring these people to do what Hitler did to the Jews and other minorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: That was something I wanted to ask you about.</span> <span id="s1802">Obviously other people died in the Holocaust, other than Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: The Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Homosexuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Jehovah Witnesses.</span> <span id="s1808">Jehovah Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1810">Have you had much contact with je – with Gentile survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: I haven’t met too many.</span> <span id="s1812">I met some, but not too many.</span> <span id="s1813">Very few Gentile survivors come forward, very, very few.</span> <span id="s1814">I had contact with liberators, but not survivors.</span> <span id="s1815">And I wish I had contact with some survivors.</span> <span id="s1816">There were Poles, there were – there were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1817">Of course, the criminal prisoners, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Priests.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Priests, Academians.</span> <span id="s1820">Very, very seldom, I na – don’t think I met maybe one or two in my lifetime here.</span> <span id="s1821">And I don’t even remember where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Just wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: I wish I would, because there are some around, believe me, there are some people around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: I know that I read a book recently about the Gypsies and the proportion of – of the Gypsies that were killed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: – gi-given the size of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: Well, the – a-and they had a Gypsy camp in Birkenau, just – Gypsy family camp, and in – in less than two nights, two nights [indecipherable] boom, boom, boom, one, two, three, they murdered close to 30,000 Gypsies, and some of them had German army uniforms on, some of the men.</span> <span id="s1828">Came from the Wehrmacht, they picked them up and brought them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1829">German Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: What about outside of this country?</span> <span id="s1831">We talked about the militia movement and the clan and what about things that you’ve observed outside of this country, Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: You mean the Bosnia, th-th-th-that – that problem there?</span> <span id="s1833">It’s a horrible item, horrible thing.</span> <span id="s1834">Elie Wiesel went to Bosnia some years back and begged the people, don’t do this to your people.</span> <span id="s1835">Look what happened to us.</span> <span id="s1836">He went to see th – some of the prisoners who he could see them through the – through the elect – through the fences and seen people with this – like s – looking like skeletons.</span> <span id="s1837">But you know, there’s a difference between Holocaust and – and Bosnia [indecipherable] Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1838">The difference is all [indecipherable] had guns.</span> <span id="s1839">They had weapons.</span> <span id="s1840">They were fighting each other with weapons.</span> <span id="s1841">Ethnic – a fa – wh-what were they fighting for?</span> <span id="s1842">Religious – religion ethnicity, for ethnics.</span> <span id="s1843">And with us, we didn’t have guns or ammunition [indecipherable] it was different.</span> <span id="s1844">But at the same time, it was a holocaust.</span> <span id="s1845">Look what they’ve done to a beautiful country, the Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1846">Years before the winter sports were held in that beautiful part of the world, and now the whole country is ruined.</span> <span id="s1847">Other than a – other than Croatia which is still in a fairly decent shape.</span> <span id="s1848">So that was a holocaust.</span> <span id="s1849">Cambodia, the boat people.</span> <span id="s1850">Vietnam war was another one.</span> <span id="s1851">You know, when Vietnam war first started, when it – when it was first started in the 60’s, late 60’s, I was for it.</span> <span id="s1852">I was for the Americans.</span> <span id="s1853">After all, here is the United States of America, you – you know, you go fight, don’t – don’t knock the soldiers that are going there.</span> <span id="s1854">And after awhile, when I listened to my children who were at the time college age, you know, and they were going demonstrating in Washington against it, I tried to listen and reason with them.</span> <span id="s1855">But kids, they’re fighting for freedom.</span> <span id="s1856">So the kids would tell me, what’s freedom?</span> <span id="s1857">It’s 10,000 miles – 20 thou – 10,000 miles away from us, what kind of freedom?</span> <span id="s1858">They’re killing innocent children and women, is that a freedom?</span> <span id="s1859">So when I first started I was very much for it, then I had to go with my kids.</span> <span id="s1860">I’ve seen that what they were talking about, they were right.</span> <span id="s1861">Maybe they were too radical about it.</span> <span id="s1862">Maybe they went overboard, maybe.</span> <span id="s1863">And some of them did.</span> <span id="s1864">I mean, in spite of the drugs, they brought some – some good things out of it, these young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: What about – I was thinking – I – I mean, I’m not trying to make parallels to what happened to you, but I’m just wondering about things that have happened in history that might have particularly concerned you or chilled you or – or the – what – and I was thinking about what happened in Rwanda in the past couple of years, where one side basically annihilated the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1867">The tutsu – tutu – tutues and – and Tutsi then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Well, that is a holocaust, a horrible, horrible, horrible crime.</span> <span id="s1870">No one even there helped, re-really.</span> <span id="s1871">What did they do?</span> <span id="s1872">Th-They fly – a plane flew over and – and dropped some food and people were killing each other for the piece of food that they could find.</span> <span id="s1873">In – in – look, Bosnia and Yugoslavia, no one helped five, six years ago when they should have helped.</span> <span id="s1874">That’s when they should have stopped right there.</span> <span id="s1875">This is when the help should have come, not today with the sending – Clinton sends the army over there now?</span> <span id="s1876">Now you send the army over there?</span> <span id="s1877">Send the army there before the first shot was fired.</span> <span id="s1878">Control it and try to do the Dayton before Dayton.</span> <span id="s1879">You know what I’m trying to say?</span> <span id="s1880">Don’t go to Dayton after every – after nine million people are murdered.</span> <span id="s1881">Go there before.</span> <span id="s1882">Make the Dayton in – in Yugoslavia, in Croatia, in Bosnia.</span> <span id="s1883">This is where you do it.</span> <span id="s1884">Nobody paid attention.</span> <span id="s1885">The next door neighbors, Germany, the Hitler y – nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s1886">When I was there testifying in Germany in ’91, it was still early enough to go there and try to stop all that.</span> <span id="s1887">They were just trying to start – starting to shoot.</span> <span id="s1888">That’s the time to go there, but oh well, we can’t send our sons to be murdered over there.</span> <span id="s1889">Nobody asked them to be murdered over there, nobody is murdered there now.</span> <span id="s1890">One [indecipherable] the guy got lost in the wooded area someplace, shot down or whatever happened to him and he survived.</span> <span id="s1891">And all you had to do was go there, send their armed forces over there and control them, send the UN over there before it happened, not after it happened.</span> <span id="s1892">So these are the things that should be done.</span> <span id="s1893">Rwanda the same way.</span> <span id="s1894">Look – did you see all these starving little innocent children?</span> <span id="s1895">Who did they hurt?</span> <span id="s1896">Same thing like the one and a half million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1897">Poor, innocent children.</span> <span id="s1898">How many professors, how many scientists, how many teachers, how many doctors were murdered among these little one and a half million children?</span> <span id="s1899">The same thing with the Rwanda people.</span> <span id="s1900">Maybe they weren’t professors in ta – i-i-in – i-i-in – but they were human beings and nobody helped.</span> <span id="s1901">Everyone turned their head the other way.</span> <span id="s1902">We were watching the news programs a – while we eating dinner and they would say to e – to wife – wife to a husband, look at this, isn’t that terrible what happening over there?</span> <span id="s1903">Oh, what’s on tonight.</span> <span id="s1904">You know, that was the end of the conversation.</span> <span id="s1905">What else is on television?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: So now we do have CNN, now we do know, we – we can’t feign ignorance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: And we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1908">And we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1909">We watching for CNN to bring us atrocities.</span> <span id="s1910">Everybody is looking for something terrible to happen.</span> <span id="s1911">Middle East, the fights, the – the – the – the fights between Palestinians and throwing stones, they’re throwing rocks, they’re doing – they – they’re burning tires, the – the – the – that – this is what CNN is for, this all the newscast is for, but no one does anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: What would you suggest people do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: The big countries, the powers should be the ones.</span> <span id="s1914">You know, I know it sounds – sounds like easy task to do, but we should be the ones to be the guards of the world.</span> <span id="s1915">And not with guns and ammunition, but sending people to try to solve their problems talking.</span> <span id="s1916">Get into the table with these people.</span> <span id="s1917">Get to the – to get to the com – get to the conferences with these people.</span> <span id="s1918">There are some people it’s hard to talk with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: You know, I’m just thinking – oh, first of all, I want to check my tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel.</span> <span id="s1922">This is tape number three, side B and we were talking about ways of intervening to prevent future –</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Holocausts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: – holocausts.</span> <span id="s1925">And I was thinking, you know, of the – the real notorious leaders, political figures, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, the – the Serbian leader, Milosevic.</span> <span id="s1926">How do you – these people don’t seem very reasonable, from everything I’ve been told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Mm-hm, yeah they aren’t.</span> <span id="s1928">They’re not reasonable.</span> <span id="s1929">But these are the people that the governments, like United States, Soviet u – or ru – former Soviet Union, anyone who has power should go to these people and say, enough killing.</span> <span id="s1930">Let’s sit down and talk about the tuti – Tutus and let’s talk about the Bosnians, let’s talk about the Cambodians here, the Pol Pots, the – the killings, it’s got to stop.</span> <span id="s1931">And someone has got to do it.</span> <span id="s1932">Now, I know it’s not easy and I know you – somebody’s going to tell me that I’m full of bull talking like this, because who is going to mix in in someone else’s kitchen?</span> <span id="s1933">Well, s-someone has to mix in in someone else’s kitchen, because we can’t go on like this.</span> <span id="s1934">One thing stops, something else starts.</span> <span id="s1935">There is never a dull moment as far as somebody killing somebody.</span> <span id="s1936">One country.</span> <span id="s1937">These [indecipherable] Rwandan people, these – these little innocent children should be saved.</span> <span id="s1938">Who’s going to save them?</span> <span id="s1939">Not the Tutsis and not whatever you want to call them Tutus or Tutsis, it’s gotta be done by a powerful country and it’s got to stop.</span> <span id="s1940">And if somebody said well, we have enough problem in this country, we have racism and anti-Semitism here, sure we do, but in the meanwhile we’re not starving, and those people are starving.</span> <span id="s1941">And those people have to be put together, those people had to have help with the – from our technology from farming and for everything.</span> <span id="s1942">Everyone – if you help people to – to feed them, you’re gonna start – you’re gonna pa – st-stop a lot of these atrocities.</span> <span id="s1943">Education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Do you – do you feel reasonably safe here now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: In this country, yes.</span> <span id="s1946">Very much so.</span> <span id="s1947">I – I feel safe because this is the best country in th – in spite of all our problems, in spite of all isms that we have here, this is still the best country in the world, and I’ve been around a few countries.</span> <span id="s1948">I’ve been around Europe, I’ve been around the Middle East.</span> <span id="s1949">This country is the country that I love, and like I tell my children, you can sing America [indecipherable] three times a day, cause there’s no other country like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1951">Why is it so great in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Because of the freedom, because of the freedom of speech, that you can say what you – what you mean and no one’s going to arrest you for it, no one’s going to shoot you for it.</span> <span id="s1953">You couldn’t talk like this in s – in Russia even today, you couldn't talk like this in some of the European countries, unless you go on the streets and start fighting like they do in Ireland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Tell me about becoming a citizen.</span> <span id="s1955">What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: That will stay as one of the f – best thing ever happening to me.</span> <span id="s1957">Of course, I could have been a citizen much sooner if I would have stayed with the United States Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s1958">I could have become a citizen as soon as I left La Havre on the way to far east Japan to – to be a replacement soldier to occupy – the occupying forces.</span> <span id="s1959">But since I didn’t, I had to wait and I got – I was taken – I was make a ci – made a citizen in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s1960">And when I went to the federal court, after I took a test – you know, they give you so much time to – to – to learn the test, who was the 16th president, who was this, who was that, and to become a citizen, with a number of people with you, and you get the oath and they give you a flag in your hand, that was the greatest thing ever – ever for me.</span> <span id="s1961">And I’ve tell you, I have never missed an election.</span> <span id="s1962">State, federal, presidential, none of them, never.</span> <span id="s1963">That is my right and I kiss the ground for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Have you gotten involved much with politics in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s1966">The on – sometime when I speak about my experiences, politics do come up and I very kindly turn it down because I am not knowledgeable in politics.</span> <span id="s1967">I read the papers, I have my opinions.</span> <span id="s1968">My opinions are for me and my family.</span> <span id="s1969">I will not s – force something on someone else.</span> <span id="s1970">I will not tell you that I’m a Republican or a Democrat because I am a person for persons.</span> <span id="s1971">And that’s the way it is, I don’t get involved.</span> <span id="s1972">I do help once in awhile with some campaign people, they say would you do this or would you do that.</span> <span id="s1973">I don’t do any fundraisers, but I help sometimes, organizations, you know, they ask me to.</span> <span id="s1974">I don’t belong to too many organizations.</span> <span id="s1975">I belong to the men’s clu – men’s brother – brotherhood in our temple, and I’m a member of the temple [indecipherable] the Jewish community relations.</span> <span id="s1976">And I have the highest soccer referee license you can get, and those are the organizations that I’m part of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: I wanted to ask you about, and in the context of your st – putting the soccer into this context, what things have given you pleasure, have given you joy since you’ve been back from Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1978">What are the things that you have, in the past 50 years gotten the most –</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Well, first and foremost, my children and my wife, that’s the first thing.</span> <span id="s1980">There’s n-not the greatest pleasure than to see childrens achieve, and I can say about my children, they’re all achievers, every one of them.</span> <span id="s1981">Second, of course, watching my grandchildren being born.</span> <span id="s1982">That is another pleasure, there’s five of them and sixth one coming.</span> <span id="s1983">I am not much of a art museum person, but being that the childrens are very much involved in arts, I do go with them sometimes, in fact Sunday we went to the museum with my wife.</span> <span id="s1984">And of course, the enjoyment that I have is teaching young people the game of soccer.</span> <span id="s1985">I happen to be one of the people, unfortunately the second person that was part of it passed away at a very young age, at the age of 47, an Englishman.</span> <span id="s1986">The two of us started soccer in the state of Indiana, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1987">So to speak, no, we – we used to travel the state to give clinics to coaches and to kids.</span> <span id="s1988">And we would take our players, who were already more knowledgeable in soccer than the rest of the state of Indiana, and take the kids with us and we would let the kids do a lot of the soccer s – stuff for them, you know, to teach them how to handle a soccer ball, how to – how to balance a soccer ball, how to juggle a soccer ball.</span> <span id="s1989">And we als – also helped them to buy equipment, soccer equipment.</span> <span id="s1990">We went into that business, the two of us, for awhile.</span> <span id="s1991">So that’s another pleasure that I have.</span> <span id="s1992">This year I was selected – elected to the soccer Hall of Fame, State of Indiana.</span> <span id="s1993">I have number of trophies which I received from my job as a soccer person, as a soccer coach and a soccer referee, number of citation.</span> <span id="s1994">Oh, there is a humanitarian award named after me also, I don’t know if I showed it to you or not, but there is one.</span> <span id="s1995">It’s hanging at one of th – the largest school – the larger high school in the state of Indiana called North Central High School.</span> <span id="s1996">This just called the Mike Vogel’s Humanitarian award.</span> <span id="s1997">Every year a person is added to that award, which is hanging at the school.</span> <span id="s1998">I have a copy of – a – a small replica of the award here at home, and that was given to me three years ago for soccer and other humanitarian things that I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: What are the other things that you do that you’ve gotten involved with in terms of f – philanthropic activities or – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Just lectu – mostly lecturing, speaking, and of course last May 24th, I was given the honorary doctorate de-degree of public service at one of the f-fine university of state of Indiana called DePauw University, which was given to me at the graduation commencement May 24th.</span> <span id="s2001">That was a nice one.</span> <span id="s2002">Last year I was selected in the state of Indiana for the Jefferson Award.</span> <span id="s2003">The Jefferson Award was founded by Robert Taft, Jr., Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a guy named Sam Beard whose father was a congressman at one time.</span> <span id="s2004">The Jefferson Award is given to people who – ev-every state – this is – this is nationwide –</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: – who do volunteer work, like speaking and helping the children and teaching children and doing li – working with homeless and so on.</span> <span id="s2007">Each state selects their own.</span> <span id="s2008">There was 127 people nominated from the state of Indiana, only 10 are selected for the na – for the Jefferson Award, and then there is a luncheon at the hotel here in town, and the 10 people that were the winners of the – from the 127 and their families and friends, they all come to the lunch, and you have a sponsor.</span> <span id="s2009">I was sponsored by “The Indianapolis Star News.”</span> <span id="s2010">And this year – last year they gave, for the first time, a 500 dollar money to be given to your charit – favorite charity.</span> <span id="s2011">My money was given to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, my 500 dollars.</span> <span id="s2012">And from the 10 people, each state selects one person to represent the state in Washington, D.C.</span> <span id="s2013">So now you won the national award.</span> <span id="s2014">You come to the national award for three days and you stay in Washington at a beautiful hotel.</span> <span id="s2015">You are allowed to bring one guest, in my case I brought my wife.</span> <span id="s2016">And then there are two gala dinners and lunches, and you meet the other people and everyone talks about what he did.</span> <span id="s2017">You give – first evening you get two minutes to say how did you come to given – be given this en – honor.</span> <span id="s2018">Then the gala dinner is held on Tuesday nights and this dot – this year was – last year was held at the women’s museum in arts, and it’s a beautiful, beautiful dinner, a dress up dinner with all sorts of dignitaries there, and congressmen, senators.</span> <span id="s2019">This dinner was funded by Heinz company, h – Heinz 57.</span> <span id="s2020">And the guests are first asked to come down, e-each given a number of table where you are sitting and we were asked to sit at a front table.</span> <span id="s2021">And when we got there and my wife – and the guests go down first.</span> <span id="s2022">Then they announce us one by one, alphabetically order and you shake hands with all these dignitaries.</span> <span id="s2023">And when you come to your table – when I got to my table the president of the Jefferson Awards, Sam Beard comes up to me and he says, after dinner I would like to speak to you.</span> <span id="s2024">Well, I didn’t know what he wanted, so little nervous about it, but anyway, dinner was over, we come to the hotel and he’s talking to me.</span> <span id="s2025">He says, tomorrow morning we’re going to the United States Supreme Court and I want you to be the closing speaker.</span> <span id="s2026">I’ll give you three minutes to speak.</span> <span id="s2027">I got a little nervous.</span> <span id="s2028">I told my wife, what am I gonna tell them?</span> <span id="s2029">She says, why don’t you jot something down?</span> <span id="s2030">I said, you know how I am with writing.</span> <span id="s2031">What am I gonna – you know, I don’t want to tell them about the Holocaust too much.</span> <span id="s2032">So I started writing but I threw it away.</span> <span id="s2033">Next morning we go to the United States Supreme Court.</span> <span id="s2034">Sandra Day O’Connor opened our session.</span> <span id="s2035">And Sam Beard was going to introduce me to speak.</span> <span id="s2036">I was fol – I followed Sam Nunn, the guy who was – was – founded C-Span and Julian Bond, you know who he is?</span> <span id="s2037">Okay, and Rosalynn Carter.</span> <span id="s2038">And I followed Rosalynn Carter – Rosalynn Carter, the pr – former President Carter’s wife.</span> <span id="s2039">So I gave them a three minute speech.</span> <span id="s2040">That was the greatest honor I could – anybody could bestow on me, speaking at the United States Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: It’s a long way from – from the K rations at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Well, it was long way from Slovakia.</span> <span id="s2043">And I told them, 50 years ago I arrived to this beautiful free country called United States of America from the ashes of Auschwitz to life.</span> <span id="s2044">My parents, my grandparents, my two brothers, my two sisters all perished, all de – murdered, gassed and burned in the largest death factory of all Nazi concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2045">Yet today, I have a mission.</span> <span id="s2046">My mission is to speak for the six million who cannot speak for themselves.</span> <span id="s2047">Today I speak at colleges, universities, high schools, civic and religious organization.</span> <span id="s2048">Not everyone is an anti-Semite in the world.</span> <span id="s2049">Not everyone is a Kurt Waldheim, Marge Schott.</span> <span id="s2050">Yet, look at me, Mike Miso Vogel, Jewish boy born in a small village of Slovakia, speaking to you in this great place called United States Supreme Court of America.</span> <span id="s2051">I thank you for this honor.</span> <span id="s2052">That was my speech.</span> <span id="s2053">I – I missed a couple lines, but that was my speech.</span> <span id="s2054">And I tell you, my wife tells me that everybody cried.</span> <span id="s2055">So, that was the honor.</span> <span id="s2056">I had a beautiful speech also at DePauw University.</span> <span id="s2057">I mise – I got it here to show you, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: I – I know we’ve been doing this for awhile, I – I – trying to focus on the – the few last questions that – that I want to make sure to – to fit in here.</span> <span id="s2059">Many of the things I wanted to ask you you’ve alre – we’ve already talked about just in the natural flow of our conversation.</span> <span id="s2060">I’m just looking through the list here.</span> <span id="s2061">Talked about that.</span> <span id="s2062">There – there’s some – some questions that they’re asking everyone just to – to sort of see what the similar experiences of other survivors have been, so this is a very general question and I mean you – you’ve touched on this in many ways, but can you talk about the long term impact that your experiences during the Holocaust have had on you?</span> <span id="s2063">That’s a – that’s a tough – I think it’s a pretty enormous question.</span> <span id="s2064">It’s – it – for example, we talked about in your family and raising your children.</span> <span id="s2065">How about in terms of trust, your ability to trust people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Well, it – that took awhile also.</span> <span id="s2067">That took – took quite awhile before I – before I believed or trusted, cause you know, that was not an easy part for me to do.</span> <span id="s2068">How could you trust after you went through what we went through?</span> <span id="s2069">How could you have faith in so-someone, you know, in someone’s word, but you didn’t, you know – here in this country, th-the BS system gets – gets – gets in the way, you know, and people tell – tells – tell tales.</span> <span id="s2070">Yet, I had a hard – I had a hard time with trusting.</span> <span id="s2071">I trusted my wife and children, but I was afraid to trust someone else.</span> <span id="s2072">So that took a long time.</span> <span id="s2073">Today I can tell by a person’s handshake.</span> <span id="s2074">When the guy looks in your eyes when he shakes your hand and he shakes it like he means it, not like a dead fish, you can almost say that here is a guy who is halfway decent and honest.</span> <span id="s2075">So I had a hard time with trusting.</span> <span id="s2076">Faith and trust was a hard thing for me, hard thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: What about just being with Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: No problem, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2079">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2080">I-I have a tremendous sense of humor, I tell jokes about ra – not racial, I’m talking about ethnic jokes, to me that’s – I tell them all the time.</span> <span id="s2081">But I have no problem with Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: But I meant when you first – whe-when you first came over, were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Oh, when I first came over?</span> <span id="s2084">Well, I first came over to Detroit, we lived in a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s2085">So only Gentiles I met was in the business world, wa – you know, in the store that I worked in.</span> <span id="s2086">So I didn’t have too much outside of my business life to do with the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s2087">But now, today, I have no problem with them.</span> <span id="s2088">I – I work with them, I – I play soccer with them, against them, and they all respect me, I respect them.</span> <span id="s2089">I have no problem whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: I was just wondering if that took awhile –</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: – to develop?</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: – no, no, not in this country, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Q: I know you’ve traveled back to Europe for different reasons and I know you went to your wife’s hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: Have you been back to Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: I have no desire, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2098">I don’t want ever to step in that Slovakian town that I came from.</span> <span id="s2099">And people tell me I’m crazy, that I should do it, I should see what it’s going on.</span> <span id="s2100">A friend of mine who just gave me the book I told you about, he just came from there.</span> <span id="s2101">It was just before – when we got to Israel he – day before we got there he got home from there.</span> <span id="s2102">And it used to be a 14,000 dollar – 14,000 population is now 40,000.</span> <span id="s2103">And he said there are no Jews there, of course, and th-there are no Jews left in Slovakia, I mean sla – any Jew who would live there would be crazy.</span> <span id="s2104">But I have no desire to go there, no.</span> <span id="s2105">I went to Prague, but not – not to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s2106">I went to the Czech Republic which was then still Czechoslovakia, but I have no desire.</span> <span id="s2107">I don’t want to see a Slovak.</span> <span id="s2108">I understand your mom comes from that world, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: She’s not born there.</span> <span id="s2110">That’s her –</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Yeah, that’s her ma –</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Her ancestors, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: – her parents, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Are there sounds or smells that evoke past experiences for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: You’re walking down the street and there’s something, boom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: No, ba – something burning?</span> <span id="s2120">No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: A few more historical things that – we talked about Vietnam, we talked about Eichmann’s trial, we talked about – what about the McCarthy era?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Well, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s2123">Then I was such a strong American believer, so strong anti-communist, cause I knew what that was, communism, that I almost went along with that – that program and – and – almost.</span> <span id="s2124">But then, of course, when I heard the way Joe McCarthy was handling the – it was on – televised in those days, you know, and I just couldn’t – this guy was a hate monger.</span> <span id="s2125">And I considered him worse than the Nazis after I’ve se – after I seen him for awhile.</span> <span id="s2126">At first I said, he’s fighting communists, it’s good.</span> <span id="s2127">Hoover is fighting communists too, that’s good.</span> <span id="s2128">But neither one of these guys were good a – good Americans, so to speak, because they were hate mongers.</span> <span id="s2129">Hoover, what did he do?</span> <span id="s2130">He went after the wrong people all the time, you know.</span> <span id="s2131">Martin Luther King.</span> <span id="s2132">What did he want from Martin Luther King?</span> <span id="s2133">Here was a man who was a peaceful demonstrator.</span> <span id="s2134">He pi – th – he th – he never wanted to throw a rock on anybody, he didn’t do any of that, he was very peaceful.</span> <span id="s2135">He put him to jail, he put him to jail, and he was nicely quiet, with his good voice, telling the world what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s2136">McCarthy was just as bad as the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2137">He went after people whom he consider – whom he – whom he accused of being a communist.</span> <span id="s2138">He took so many lives away from people – so many livelihoods away from people in – in – in those years.</span> <span id="s2139">He was the – one of the worst thing – he was an animal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Did it frighten you at all?</span> <span id="s2141">I understand that you were supportive of the – the – the larger aims and the – were a good anti-communist, but w-were you frightened at all to see – I mean, there were some similarities it – it seems, in retrospect with the techniques used to accuse people and – and you know, neighbors against neighbors and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: – people turning each other in, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Mm-hm, yup, yup.</span> <span id="s2145">I’d w – it frightened me, because it was similar like what happened – here – here is a Jew living, here is a – you know, they’re – they’re telling on people, or how to catch people, telling on your neighbors to save your own skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Oh, we’ll let you go if you tell about all the other people in your club.</span> <span id="s2147">A: Yeah, well, that’s right.</span> <span id="s2148">We’ll – we’ll – well, your okay, but you tell me e-everything about the other people and your – your – you’re a free man.</span> <span id="s2149">And that’s – that’s what McCarthyism was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Did you know anybody that got ga – caught up in that, was a victim of that?</span> <span id="s2151">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s2152">I knew – I knew someone in Binghamton, New York when we lived there that he was falsely accused – she was falsely accused.</span> <span id="s2153">She went once to a – a communist meeting with her – one of her friends and they accused her of being a member.</span> <span id="s2154">This was during the McCarthy era.</span> <span id="s2155">But of course did – nothing happened to her.</span> <span id="s2156">And he – her husband was working for GE at the time as an engineer and they could have gotten in trouble, you know, he could have lost his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: I was just wondering because there were a disproportionate number of Jews involved, Jews in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Lot of Jews involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: – labor –</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Labor and actors, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: – and – and academia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: – academia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: And so many – it seemed like if you were involved with any sort of Jewish youth group in the 30’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: – well, that was enough reason to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: It was the – the Workmen Society was another one, Jewish group, Workmen Society and they all called them communists, because it’s a Workmen Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: You were too old to be drafted for Korea, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: You – you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Well actually I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2171">No, I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Yeah, I was thinking you would have been just in the – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: In the 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Yeah, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2176">I was in the 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2178">Did you – we – you – you mentioned Martin Luther King earlier, with some – clearly someone that you re – had respect for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Tal – let’s talk a little bit about the – the Civil Rights movement in this country, the – for blacks that were looking to –</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2182">See, when I came to this country, there was still lynching in the south, okay?</span> <span id="s2183">In the 40’s and 50’s it was – late 40’s, it was still – you could still – there was some lynching in the south, and we couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s2184">When we – when we move – when I first met my wife in Detroit, went to look for an apartment in the apartment building, there was a sign, no Jews, no dogs, no niggers.</span> <span id="s2185">Now this is coming from Auschwitz to si – to this, right?</span> <span id="s2186">Now, let’s go to the Civil Right movements.</span> <span id="s2187">I never marched with them, okay, never went with them anywhere, but I was very much for those people, very much so.</span> <span id="s2188">The demonstration, the burning, the si – the big cities like Detroit was burning, Los Angeles was burning.</span> <span id="s2189">I was against that, that part bothered me.</span> <span id="s2190">What were they burning?</span> <span id="s2191">They were burning their own neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s2192">That was the worst part, you see, that part was wrong on them.</span> <span id="s2193">But wha – what e – what else were they doing?</span> <span id="s2194">They were looting.</span> <span id="s2195">See, that was wrong – wrong, too.</span> <span id="s2196">See, they went the wrong way.</span> <span id="s2197">They were afraid to go to the better neighborhoods, but they went to their own ne – they burned their own neighborhood, burned their own houses down, burned their own storekeepers down.</span> <span id="s2198">So – but I tell you, racism and anti-Semitism unfortunately, unless the whole world will change, as – and it’s gonna take awhile, the whole United States will change, it will stay with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: What would you i – if it were in your power to engineer how things were done, let’s just say in this country, not even the world, where would you start to – to stop anti-Semitism and racism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Now, or then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: If you were starting – if now they said, Mike Vogel, you’re in charge of Indianapolis and how we’re gonna do things from now on, wh-where would you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: I would show them what racism and anti-Semitism can do to a folk – can do to people.</span> <span id="s2205">I would tell them about it.</span> <span id="s2206">What can happen when – when anti-Semitism and racism flourishes.</span> <span id="s2207">That people are being murdered, people are being deprived of freedom, people are being deprived of that.</span> <span id="s2208">If this is the kind of world we want in the United States, this is not what we need.</span> <span id="s2209">What we need is education.</span> <span id="s2210">We need people – better schools, we need to teach people about indifference, we need te – teach people about all of us are equal and that’s what we should do.</span> <span id="s2211">As a survivor I’m speaking to you today that racism, anti-Semitism should be abolished an-and quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: It’s not an act of Congress though, that you can –</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Unfortunately, it’s not an act of Congress, yeah.</span> <span id="s2214">And we have some people there in the Congress that are – that are anti-Semites or – or racists.</span> <span id="s2215">They try to be nice, but they’re – they’re – they’re – right down – deep down they’re – they’re – they’re racists and anti-Semites.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: Are there any people – let’s see, how can I ask the question.</span> <span id="s2217">Have there been a-any p-political leaders or individuals in – in the – in the intervening 50 years, other than McCarthy who we talked about, that you were particularly worried about, or that – fearful about, or that – that you thought were –</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: Oh, during the Demjanjuk trial in Israel, there was a cup – there was a guy from Ohio, can’t think of his name, a congressman from Ohio, but he was an anti-Semite and he didn’t m-mince words about it.</span> <span id="s2219">Another one is Pat Buchanan is – is the one that I fear a lot.</span> <span id="s2220">And I don’t know why he always ends up getting the same job back on CNN on – on – in same program he gets on.</span> <span id="s2221">He is another guy that I’m deathly afraid of that if he ever gets any power, what he could do.</span> <span id="s2222">He is a clear anti-Semite who denies the Holocaust very much.</span> <span id="s2223">Him and his sister.</span> <span id="s2224">And one of the actors, Marlon Brando.</span> <span id="s2225">Marlon Brando was on the lar – Larry King show last year, before I went to the Jefferson awards.</span> <span id="s2226">And he said Hollywood is controlled by Jews, and if you don’t go through the Jews, you don’t get anywhere in Hollywood.</span> <span id="s2227">Now look at him, he has made millions in Hollywood, and if Hollywood controlled the Jews, they certainly helped him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: What in particular concerns you about Pat Buchanan, for example, what’s your fear that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: Pat Buchanan, his politics.</span> <span id="s2230">He sounds like an anti anybo – anti-all – all an – he’s an anti-Semite, anti-race.</span> <span id="s2231">And he’s the one who protected and defended Demjanjuk through the government, OSI, Office of Special Investigation had the wrong man, as far as being Demjanjuk, but did not have the wrong man as far as being a former Nazi guard.</span> <span id="s2232">He was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel.</span> <span id="s2235">This is tape number four, side A, and we are finishing up the interview with a last couple of questions and you were in the midst of –</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: Pat Buchanan?</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: – yeah, and th – you mentioned the Demjanjuk –</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Demjanjuk was the guy who was called th – th-the – the – them – the – they – the – Ivan the Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: You know, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: – Demjanjuk, yeah.</span> <span id="s2243">He was one of the – he was a – supposedly in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s2244">But it ended a – it turned out he was not in Treblinka.</span> <span id="s2245">He was not Ivan the Terrible.</span> <span id="s2246">He was a ca-camp guard, a Nazi camp guard in Sobibor and two more other camps.</span> <span id="s2247">They also got the wrong information about him.</span> <span id="s2248">He came to this country illegally, lying about his past.</span> <span id="s2249">He committed crime against humanity and he should be punished for it, but he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2250">Oh, he was punished, he was a year and a half in prison in Israel.</span> <span id="s2251">Pat Buchanan was very much against the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2252">The people do not remember what happened.</span> <span id="s2253">The people identified him wrongly and he was never a Nazi.</span> <span id="s2254">He was a poor Ukrainian who came – emigrated to America, went to work in a Cleveland automobile factory, where he made a damn good living and never revealed his past.</span> <span id="s2255">Demjanjuk was a Nazi, and he’s living in Cleveland, maybe not as comfortably as he’d like to today because of all that had happened to him, but he’s still there, free man and his children think he’s the greatest thing on two feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: I’m – I’m winding down here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: Did you – ho-how would you say you were – have – okay, how can I – we’ve talked about that.</span> <span id="s2259">Does a day go by – I know now you’re rather involved with – and speak about – an-and you’ve got many books and – and correspondences with other survivors and with academics and writers and whatnot.</span> <span id="s2260">Prior to this time, do many days go by that you’re not reminded of your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Unfortunately not.</span> <span id="s2262">Auschwitz always comes up, always, every day, somehow or other – some – some – somewhere or other.</span> <span id="s2263">You know, especially since the Swiss situation happened, I was asked – in fact, I was written up in the paper about the Swiss ca – Swiss monies, gold money.</span> <span id="s2264">Well, it – it – it got so that every day I was being called by someone in the – in the media, just about.</span> <span id="s2265">And I must tell you this, that I certainly didn’t know about the Swiss money.</span> <span id="s2266">Didn’t know about the Swiss gold.</span> <span id="s2267">I knew about the gold that was yanked out of the Jewish teeth.</span> <span id="s2268">I knew about the money that was confiscated from the Jews when they arrived to Auschwitz, but I certainly didn’t know that it went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2269">There are gold bars in Switzerland with – with a swastika on it and – in – in – in Switzerland, in Swiss banks.</span> <span id="s2270">It came from Auschwitz and other camps, that it was yanked out of teeth that they were gassing.</span> <span id="s2271">So never a day goes by without something happening, something somebody mention – mentions Auschwitz to me, or somebody comes up to me and asks me something about it.</span> <span id="s2272">Unfortunately that’s part of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: Do you ever wish that you could just say, you know, I’m going on vacation from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: You know, I – for the next –</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: There are times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: – for the next –</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: There are times that I say, hey listen, not today, okay?</span> <span id="s2279">You want to see me, come to hear me speak someplace else, but leave me – let me eat my lunch.</span> <span id="s2280">But you know, it never happens.</span> <span id="s2281">Some guy went up to me, oh I seen you in the paper about the Jefferson award.</span> <span id="s2282">I’ve seen you in the paper about a – about the doctorate degree you received at DePauw.</span> <span id="s2283">And it’s – it’s always starts and you – you know, I’m – I’m the – I’m a people’s person so I – I – I – I don’t want to be rude to anyone, so I gave them a couple of minutes and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2284">But there are times I say, listen, not today, please.</span> <span id="s2285">Let’s – let’s talk about it some other time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: You – you talked about how you ended up speaking about your experiences to your children and – and how you wished you’d handled that differently.</span> <span id="s2287">Now you have grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2288">What conversations have you had with your grandchildren and how has –</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: Much more than my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: And it –</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: Much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Why don’t you just talk maybe about one grandchild and – and how you’ve – came to talk with them about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: Well, first we have an o – grandchild that’s 21 years old now, she is – so she came to me and she has my film.</span> <span id="s2294">She came and brought the film to school, and she asks questions and I tell her.</span> <span id="s2295">This grandchild knows more than my children ever did.</span> <span id="s2296">But I have the youngest grandchild and – I should say the 10 year old granddaughter who came with us to Israel on this trip, and she was allowed to go to Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s2297">This kid stuck with me like glue while I was speaking and she would not leave me for a moment, she was so tight next to me, holding onto me.</span> <span id="s2298">And after that, she says, Grandpa, that was very sad.</span> <span id="s2299">The museum and also your speech.</span> <span id="s2300">So th – our grandchildren know much, much more now than our kids ever knew.</span> <span id="s2301">So the 10 year old asked me to promise her when she is 12 years old, she wants to hear the whole story.</span> <span id="s2302">She says, by 12, I’m gonna be better equipped to listen to it.</span> <span id="s2303">And I will do it for her.</span> <span id="s2304">Just before her Bar Mitzvah – her Bat Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2306">We talked about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Didn’t you finish yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Just about.</span> <span id="s2309">Trust me.</span> <span id="s2310">We talked about that, talked about that.</span> <span id="s2311">We really talked about all the things I –</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: We gotta do the corrections over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: Yes, but that’s not something that need – need be done on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: No, no?</span> <span id="s2315">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: You can just – we just need the correct spelling of each of those names.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2318">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: The last question I was going to ask you, I – I think I basically already asked you, and that’s how do we keep this from happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Teach the people.</span> <span id="s2321">Let them read the history books.</span> <span id="s2322">Indifference.</span> <span id="s2323">Indifference is a word that I started using with Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s2324">And that’s the word that is very important.</span> <span id="s2325">Don’t look at me what I look like, look at me what I am.</span> <span id="s2326">And listen to me what I got to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: Is there anything you would like to say in closing that we haven’t touched on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: No, I think –</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: – that you feel strongly about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: – we – we covered just about everything, but I want to say something about the Holocaust Museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s2331">I respect this organization very, very much.</span> <span id="s2332">The staff at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, whom I respect an awful lot.</span> <span id="s2333">Everyone that I ever was in touch with, in contact with.</span> <span id="s2334">These people are professionals.</span> <span id="s2335">And I hope when the day comes that there no longer will be any survivors, that these people at the Holocaust Museum will carry on, so Auschwitz will not become a legend.</span> <span id="s2336">I want to thank them for all that they have done.</span> <span id="s2337">Thank you, Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2339">Thank you, Mr. Vogel.</span> <span id="s2340">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel on this
