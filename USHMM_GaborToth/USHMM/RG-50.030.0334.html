id="s10">01:00:02</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Could you tell us your full name and where and when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I'm Gerda Haas, born Gerda Schild in Ansbach which is a small town in Germany – Bavaria – and I was born in November of 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And can you tell us something about your family, your sister, your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s17">Ansbach was – had a very religious Jewish community.</span> <span id="s18">We had some famous rabbanimthere – Elie Munk for instance who wrote The World Of Prayer, wrote it there in Ansbach while I was his student, and I was very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s19">We always experienced some anti-Semitism in Bavaria – not outright – but we always felt we didn't belong to the whole town, so it was a strong and purposeful Jewish community that we had.</span> <span id="s20">And almost everybody was deeply religious.</span> <span id="s21">My father was the Jewish butcher in town, naturally kosher.</span> <span id="s22">There was nothing else.</span> <span id="s23">And we lived in a nice, heavy, solid stone house where we had lived for many years.</span> <span id="s24">My grandmother lived with us, my Aunt Adelheid, an unmarried aunt and there were two girls, myself and my sister Friedl.</span> <span id="s25">So it was a warm, extended, nice family.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No.</span> <span id="s28">Mother only went into the butcher store when it got very busy.</span> <span id="s29">It wasn't done in those days.</span> <span id="s30">Mothers didn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Tell me what the relationships were like in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: We were very close.</span> <span id="s33">It was understood that the younger generation took care of the older generations.</span> <span id="s34">There was never a question about it.</span> <span id="s35">We didn't even have any old age homes.</span> <span id="s36">There was a little separate apartment for my grandmother where she could do her own cooking if she wanted to, but I have never seen – I never remember that she did.</span> <span id="s37">She always ate and lived with us.</span> <span id="s38">And my Aunt Adelheid was – she had her own little business.</span> <span id="s39">She kept chickens and sold chickens, and I remember a lot how she took care of hens, and how she took us out with her into the yard and we could feel for the eggs, and that was always a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s40">It was a very primitive, solid, early 1900's kind of a context that I grew up on.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">1 Rabbis (Hebrew)</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And were these hens in your yard?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yeah, right in the backyard of our house.</span> <span id="s44">It was a big house and you walked through and out into the yard, and there were the hens on one side and my father's sausage making machinery would be way down on the other side.</span> <span id="s45">And my mother's vegetable garden on this side over here.</span> <span id="s46">And our swing where my sister and I swang and played ball was on this corner here, and it was fun.</span> <span id="s47">We had very happy childhood until Hitler came when I was ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">01:03:31</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Were you closer to one parent more than another?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: If possible, closer to my mother because she was more around.</span> <span id="s51">Father used to get up at four in the morning to buy the cows that he needed for his butcher shop, and then he had to go to the next town to have them shekhted, the Jewish way of slaughtering the meat.</span> <span id="s52">And then he had to come back and he cut up that whole animal right in the backyard.</span> <span id="s53">I wasn't squeamish about it.</span> <span id="s54">And so he was always busy.</span> <span id="s55">And when he came home he was short tempered you know – the customers aggravated him.</span> <span id="s56">Mother always was even tempered and sweet and kind and pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you ever work in the butcher store?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span> <span id="s59">I only went there to get some sausage – eat a little bit.</span> <span id="s60">Q: And did Aunt Adelheid provide chickens for your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s62">Aunt Adelheid provided Father with the chickens.</span> <span id="s63">They’s also have to be shekhted the kosher way.</span> <span id="s64">I remember that quite well.</span> <span id="s65">At one time there was a phenomenon of a chicken running around with his head cut off already, the proverbial – he wasn't – somehow it didn't die right away and flattered or flipped around for a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes, very religious – very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s68">There was nothing else in small towns.</span> <span id="s69">In fact, in all of Germany you were either very religious or you weren't aware of your Jewishness at all – you were very, very Reformed.</span> <span id="s70">Conservative Judaism had not been invented, yet.</span> <span id="s71">So, yes, we were very religious and interestingly enough, the religion was state supported.</span> <span id="s72">In other words we always had to mark on taxes or on any forms – on birth certificates, wedding forms or anything – our affiliation.</span> <span id="s73">It was always Jewish because the state paid for the upkeep of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s74">The state paid for the salary of the Rabbi or the Hazan, or the Shohet.</span> <span id="s75">So there was never a question that we were very Jewish, and everybody knew that and everybody, up to a certain point, respected it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">01:06:01</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, we did have non-Jewish friends but not real good chums.</span> <span id="s79">They were just the kids on the block that we played with.</span> <span id="s80">My parents didn't restrict us in going out with only Jewish people.</span> <span id="s81">It didn't seem a problem.</span> <span id="s82">We knew so much where we belonged and who we were that there was no danger for us to intermingle or anything.</span> <span id="s83">So, yes, we did have non-Jewish friends up to a certain point.</span> <span id="s84">But the real close friends were the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And when you went to school, it was a mixed school?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s87">In grade school.</span> <span id="s88">I don't remember too much about grade school, but then I went to the Lyzeum – that was like it would here be maybe a high school, and then junior college.</span> <span id="s89">That was already considered higher education.</span> <span id="s90">The girls went to the Lyzeum and the boys went to the Gymnasium,which here is an athletic term, but over there it was an academic term.</span> <span id="s91">So, yes I do remember that very well.</span> <span id="s92">I was admitted in 1933 at the age of 10 only because I could prove that my father was a World War I veteran.</span> <span id="s93">Already, Hitler had just come to power in January.</span> <span id="s94">I was admitted to school that fall.</span> <span id="s95">And I remember I had to bring some proof that my father had received the Iron Cross First Class in World War One and otherwise I could not have gone.</span> <span id="s96">I would have already been repelled as a Jewish student.</span> <span id="s97">So I did go, but I didn't stay very long.</span> <span id="s98">In 1936 there was a law that – it was phrased in that way – German students do no longer have to be subjected to sitting in the same room with Jewish students.</span> <span id="s99">So of course it was the Jewish students who had to leave.</span> <span id="s100">I always thought it was a very interesting way of framing it.</span> <span id="s101">In those early years Hitler was still a little bit more cautious and modest in his demands on us than he was later on.</span> <span id="s102">But up to then we were accepted.</span> <span id="s103">We did not – slowly we did not chum around with the German children anymore.</span> <span id="s104">I remember there were two Jewish students in my class, myself and Matilda Adler(ph).</span> <span id="s105">How some names will stay with you all your life!</span> <span id="s106">And she and I were, little by little, we were ostracized.</span> <span id="s107">I remember us standing in the corner in the school yard.</span> <span id="s108">We couldn't mingle with the other kids anymore.</span> <span id="s109">And they weren't mean to us, but they were not allowed to be friendly to us.</span> <span id="s110">If they would, they were being punished.</span> <span id="s111">And I also remember that I was not allowed to answer questions in school, even if I knew the answer.</span> <span id="s112">After a while I didn't even raise my hand anymore because I knew the teacher could not possibly call on me.</span> <span id="s113">As a Jewish student I was supposed to be stupid.</span> <span id="s114">I was supposed to be ignorant.</span> <span id="s115">I was not – Jews – Hitler declared Jews as stupid, so how could I know any answers?</span> <span id="s116">And that hurt a while but then I got use to it.</span> <span id="s117">But finally in ‘36 we had to leave.</span> <span id="s118">And I got as far as fourth grade in there instead of the ordinary sixth grade.</span> <span id="s119">I didn't graduate.</span> <span id="s120">And that hurt because I didn't know what else to do.</span> <span id="s121">I couldn't stay at home – and I couldn't go to any other school, so that the childhood years were happy, but the school years already were not.</span> <span id="s122">And my sister who was a year ahead of me – same story.</span> <span id="s123">She was the only Jewish girl in her class and she was even more ostracized and picked upon – and she was more timid than I was.</span> <span id="s124">I was always more the “tomboy” type and she was very much more gentle and introverted than I was.</span> <span id="s125">So 2 High school (German) she suffered actually more than I did.</span> <span id="s126">And when we came home we talked a little about it, but then we tried to forget it and just integrate into our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">01:10:45</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Did your parents give you any advice about what to do when you came home and talked about this kind of abuse?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Did my parents give me any advice?</span> <span id="s130">I would say “no.”</span> <span id="s131">My parents already were wrapped up in their own problems.</span> <span id="s132">Already, very early in Hitler's reign, the Schechtverbotcame – and I think what you mean by that.</span> <span id="s133">The Jews were no longer allowed to kill their animals in the ritualistic way by shekhting.</span> <span id="s134">And I always thought that was such an irony.</span> <span id="s135">The reason Hitler gave for that Schechtverbot was, it was inhumane to the animals.</span> <span id="s136">Think about that for a minute.</span> <span id="s137">For the animals he had pity, but for us – he put us into the gas.</span> <span id="s138">There was no more inhumanity involved there.</span> <span id="s139">So in ‘38, being very considerate for those poor animals, there was the Schechtverbot.</span> <span id="s140">And then Father had his own problems.</span> <span id="s141">I remember how Father and Mother and grandmother and Aunt Adelheid used to sit in the room and just try to figure out what the future will bring.</span> <span id="s142">Now all he had to sell were the chickens, you see.</span> <span id="s143">For a while there was frozen meat from Argentina, but who's going to buy frozen meat in 1936.</span> <span id="s144">It was unheard of.</span> <span id="s145">Nobody would touch it – and so he gave that up very quickly.</span> <span id="s146">And then there was no more income, except for that little bit that we made on the chickens.</span> <span id="s147">And they were having problems.</span> <span id="s148">For a long time I remember Father saying, “Mir gehen mit dem letzten Zug."</span> <span id="s149">That was Bayerisch– that was Bavarian dialect for "We're going to go with the last train.</span> <span id="s150">We're going to stick it out.</span> <span id="s151">We're not gonna leave here."</span> <span id="s152">But after a while he had to realize that there was no "letzten Zug."</span> <span id="s153">There was not gonna be a last train.</span> <span id="s154">So they had their own problems, and no, we didn't bother them with our problems.</span> <span id="s155">They couldn't have helped us anyway.</span> <span id="s156">If we ever confided into anyone it was Aunt Adelheid and grandmother.</span> <span id="s157">They seemed to – they were very close to us.</span> <span id="s158">Does that give you a little picture of my home life?</span> <span id="s159">It was a nice, close, lovely family.</span> <span id="s160">And then came 1938 – KristallnachtFor a while the non- Jews were moderate in their intercourse with us.</span> <span id="s161">They held back, but they weren't hostile.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">And I remember some of the closer non-Jewish friends used to come to the back door at night when no one would see them and used to bring us maybe a little bread or some fruit because already we couldn't buy everything we wanted to.</span> <span id="s163">All of a sudden that was – the Jews couldn't really buy what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">01:13:37</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Can you explain that some because I – what kinds of restrictions there were, on movement and purchase– 3 Shekht prohibition (German) 4 We are going with the last train (Bavarian German)</span></p> <p><span id="s166">5 Bavarian (German) 6 Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Well, little by little the merchants would become hostile to us.</span> <span id="s168">And when they saw us coming the better things would disappear under the counter, like the better fruits.</span> <span id="s169">I remember there were always Blut Orangenfrom America – that was those red oranges from America which was – that was just a delicacy for us.</span> <span id="s170">I remember that so much.</span> <span id="s171">Mother used to bring that home once in a while.</span> <span id="s172">But then as time went on, there were no more Blut Orangen.</span> <span id="s173">They disappeared the minute they saw us coming.</span> <span id="s174">And so, little by little, there was hostility.</span> <span id="s175">And dearth by us, after a little while, and we became poor.</span> <span id="s176">I remember how we used to sit around that Blaupunkt radio that we had.</span> <span id="s177">I can still remember that so well.</span> <span id="s178">You used to turn the knob and the whole dial would zoom back and forth.</span> <span id="s179">You didn't have to turn the knob little by little.</span> <span id="s180">You just touched it a little and the dial would fly away from you and you had to catch it to where you wanted it.</span> <span id="s181">But no matter which station you took, there was always Hitler's voice on the radio – always this frightening voice – this loud, hypnotizing speech that he gave – always against the Jews and how he would make the life of the Germans better and better if they would just follow him and do away with the Jews – and the Jews had taken all their good things – and the whole Versailles Treaty was the fault of the Jews.</span> <span id="s182">The huge banners that came up over Ansbach that used to say, “Die Juden sind unser Unglück” – "The Jews are our misfortune.</span> <span id="s183">Everything bad that happened to the Germans is the fault of the Jews."</span> <span id="s184">And my sister and I used to slink by those huge banners that were all over the city and we used to try just not to see them, thinking if we didn't see them, they weren't there.</span> <span id="s185">But they were there.</span> <span id="s186">Little by little that really took over.</span> <span id="s187">And I remember the torch parades that came.</span> <span id="s188">Hitler visited Ansbach many times actually.</span> <span id="s189">It was a stronghold for the SA, the earlier group as you know.</span> <span id="s190">First came the SA and then came the SS The SA was the Sturmabteilungand then the SS was the SchutzstaffelnThey actually – it started out as a personal body guard of Hitler, but then the SA was pushed aside and the SS became the dominant military and civil force in Germany.</span> <span id="s191">But I remember still the SA going down our cobblestone streets with their large torches and singing and marching.</span> <span id="s192">And these were all young kids that we still knew at one time before they became SA It was always frightening.</span> <span id="s193">And when Hitler came into town the Jews, of course, were ordered to stay away – stay off the streets.</span> <span id="s194">And also an interesting thing was, in the Nuremberg Laws what we thought was the least ominous law was, that the Jews could not fly the German flag.</span> <span id="s195">That, you know, we thought that we could live with.</span> <span id="s196">Well, who wants it to fly the German flag?</span> <span id="s197">But it turned out that was also a seminal law.</span> <span id="s198">Right away they could tell which house was Jewish because everybody else had to fly the flag.</span> <span id="s199">So that was also an interesting law.</span> <span id="s200">That was up to Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s201">After that it was no problem anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">01:18:14</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Prior to Kristallnacht, do you remember seeing anyone beaten up?</span> <span id="s204">Were you ever in a 7 Blood oranges (German) 8 The Jews are our misfortune (German) 9 Storm troopers (German) 10 Protection Squads (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s205">difficult situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: No, except the kids used to – after a while they threw stones at us, or they made snowballs with a stone inside you know and hit it at us, and we didn't know.</span> <span id="s207">And that was, of course, like a missile.</span> <span id="s208">And we couldn't retaliate.</span> <span id="s209">We couldn't throw a snowball back.</span> <span id="s210">Number one, we were much too timid, and number two, they would have just killed us if we had.</span> <span id="s211">They were already – now the Hitlerjungend.Both the boys and the girls had to be in the Hitlerjungend, the youth organization of the SS, and they were all powerful.</span> <span id="s212">When they had their little Hitlerjungend’s uniforms on, they felt like they were God themselves.</span> <span id="s213">Otherwise, back to your question, no, I have not seen anyone being beaten up.</span> <span id="s214">But I will tell you, we didn't provoke them.</span> <span id="s215">We stayed in our houses and we slunk around the streets and if we saw anyone–</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Mrs. Haas, can you go back to this time and talk a little bit about the intimidation that you were feeling.</span> <span id="s217">You said that you would walk sort of in a frightened way and would stay in your house.</span> <span id="s218">What was this doing to you and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, when you are 10 years old and from that time on, and my sister was only a year and a half older, when you're constantly told that you are stupid, and – they called it " Untermensch," “subhuman” – and you personally are responsible for everything that's going wrong in all of Germany, and practically in all the world, and you can't shine in any way.</span> <span id="s220">You can't let your imagination, or your intellect, or your normal physical appearances come up and speak for yourself – for itself, after a while that does something to you.</span> <span id="s221">After a while – after 10 years of this, you believe you are stupid.</span> <span id="s222">You believe you look Jewish and you look ugly and you are not worthy of anything.</span> <span id="s223">And it really took a while to get over this.</span> <span id="s224">And you know I see some older people nowadays that have gone through this whole thing and it looks to me as if they haven't gotten over it yet.</span> <span id="s225">They still feel that they are the less human – the lesser human race – and I still – they look depressed to me.</span> <span id="s226">I think I got over it, but during the time I believed I was no good.</span> <span id="s227">I believed I was a second rate human being.</span> <span id="s228">It was a terrible thing to do.</span> <span id="s229">And you must understand, on the other hand, these very same kids that went to school with me who up to then were nothing, they came from a downtrodden, broken home, they had no clothes to wear, they – in many cases they had to come to the Jewish families to beg for food and substances, they were suddenly dressed up in their Nazi uniforms and their – first in their Hitlerjungend uniforms, which were splendid.</span> <span id="s230">They were beautiful, and later on they were dressed up in their SA and SS uniforms, underneath they were still very mediocre, very pedestrian German people.</span> <span id="s231">But all of a sudden they were shining, they were beautiful.</span> <span id="s232">And don't forget, a uniform really does something to you psychologically.</span> <span id="s233">These people not only had their uniform on, but they felt they were the uniform.</span> <span id="s234">They felt they could do beautiful things just because they looked so great.</span> <span id="s235">And they did.</span> <span id="s236">They got away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">11 Hitler youth (German) 12 Sub-human (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial theory.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">01:22:14 As you very well know, one of the very first laws that Hitler put onto the books in Germany was the Gestapo Law of 1936 which stated that anyone in an SS, in a Nazi uniform, would stand above the law – could do anything they wanted to, could up to kill the Jews openly on the street.</span> <span id="s239">As long as they were in their Nazi uniform the law could not touch them.</span> <span id="s240">Now if you think of it, we on the other hand were since the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, staatenlos, stateless.</span> <span id="s241">That means we had no recourse to the law.</span> <span id="s242">Any injustice that was done to us, forget it.</span> <span id="s243">There was no law to go to, to complain.</span> <span id="s244">But they – and the psychological effect of that is not to be underestimated.</span> <span id="s245">They were indeed the supermen the all powerful, unapproachable.</span> <span id="s246">No law could touch them.</span> <span id="s247">And as we, when we were ten years old were told how low we were, they were told how great they were – and by the time they were 20 and 25 and we met them again in the killing centers, their psychology had changed just as much as ours had.</span> <span id="s248">I don't know how to impress upon you what a uniform will do a person.</span> <span id="s249">It suddenly makes him into a semi-god.</span> <span id="s250">And Hitler was no dummy about that.</span> <span id="s251">His uniforms were beautiful, shiny; those boots, those helmets, all those buttons and rows of things.</span> <span id="s252">And then the names, they all of a sudden were – they weren't just Johann Schmidt anymore – they were Oberscharführerand they were Blockleiter.And the kids already they were – I can't remember all the German names, but suddenly they got a title.</span> <span id="s253">They were somebody.</span> <span id="s254">And they had quite forgotten that underneath the uniform there was really nothing much, but that's – but you don't know that when you're stuck in it.</span> <span id="s255">You only know that 50 years later when you acquire a little overview and a little insight.</span> <span id="s256">But that was part of the success of the Nazis – those uniforms, and the singing, and the torch parades.</span> <span id="s257">That was uplifting to them and to the spectators – to the people who watched.</span> <span id="s258">They suddenly belonged.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">01:24:24</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Did you ever get angry at this when you were – during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s262">I don't think we were angry.</span> <span id="s263">I don't think we were allowed anger.</span> <span id="s264">We were just allowed fear, fear and trembling.</span> <span id="s265">I still remember so well when they sat around the table at night and worried, and worried, “What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s266">What are we going to do with the kids?”</span> <span id="s267">We couldn't go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s268">“How are we gonna live?”</span> <span id="s269">Anger was far away.</span> <span id="s270">Worry and fear was the dominant emotions.</span> <span id="s271">And then the belief in God, that never left us.</span> <span id="s272">“God will help.</span> <span id="s273">God will bring resolution.</span> <span id="s274">Hitler won't last long.</span> <span id="s275">Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by Christmas.</span> <span id="s276">Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by spring.</span> <span id="s277">No, he wasn't.”</span> <span id="s278">We believed our own wishes.</span> <span id="s279">We didn't believe Mein Kampfand all the raging speeches that he gave – that he prophesied that he would make Germany “Judenrein.”</span> <span id="s280">That</span></p> <p><span id="s281">13 Stateless (German) 14 Upper crowd leader (German) 15 Block leader (German) 16 My Struggle (German) was the big deal.</span> <span id="s282">It went in one ear and out the other for us.</span> <span id="s283">What does he mean “Judenrein”?</span> <span id="s284">This is not a word we grew up with.</span> <span id="s285">So we ignored it.</span> <span id="s286">But he knew what he meant and he did it too.</span> <span id="s287">Now I get angry when I think about it, but in those days, no, there was no anger.</span> <span id="s288">There was only great, great fear.</span> <span id="s289">And then we gathered around our Rabbi and he told us...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Everybody was so short-sighted.</span> <span id="s291">Everybody was so blind.</span> <span id="s292">Even the Rabbi, whom we thought had real insight and foresight and a direct line to God you know, he said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s293">Everything will be alright.</span> <span id="s294">Don't leave Ansbach.</span> <span id="s295">Stay, stay, stay."</span> <span id="s296">But unfortunately, then he was the first to leave.</span> <span id="s297">He went and got a job in Paris as a Rabbi and he left.</span> <span id="s298">And that opened our eyes after that.</span> <span id="s299">We too began to leave.</span> <span id="s300">That hurt me more than anything else – that our Rabbi left us our beloved Rabbi.</span> <span id="s301">It's like your father leaving you.</span> <span id="s302">That was interesting in retrospect.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: When did he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: I mustn't get too wound up in all my memories and emotions here.</span> <span id="s305">Q: When did he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: When did he leave?</span> <span id="s307">He left – I think he left in ‘36 before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s308">I'm not sure on that anymore.</span> <span id="s309">It might have been after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s310">I'm not sure anymore.</span> <span id="s311">But I was especially close to him and to all his children and to his wife, and I felt a great sense of loss when he left so suddenly without telling us – and still preaching to the last minute – “Stay, be calm, God will help, God will send rescue.”</span> <span id="s312">And in the meantime he had already arranged for himself a job in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Did that make you cynical?</span> <span id="s314">A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Did that make you cynical in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: I was too young to know what cynical was.</span> <span id="s317">Those emotions you are mentioning are luxuries.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">We were just plain, down to earth.</span> <span id="s319">We just dealt with the basics here – hope, anger and always the belief in God.</span> <span id="s320">That never left us.</span> <span id="s321">And in a way it was a big help.</span> <span id="s322">It was a big help.</span> <span id="s323">We would have despaired if we didn't have that, that hope for the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">01:29:05</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Did you maintain religious observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s327">I did.</span> <span id="s328">I did, but in a modified way.</span> <span id="s329">We grew up very religious, as I said.</span> <span id="s330">There was nothing else.</span> <span id="s331">And we adored our Rabbi.</span> <span id="s332">We would do anything he would tell us to.</span> <span id="s333">And I'm not only speaking of my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s334">But that whole youth group whose picture you have seen.</span> <span id="s335">We gathered around him every Shabbos and we were devoted to him.</span> <span id="s336">That great faith, I think, helped me a great deal, because later on when things really got... What I'm telling you now, that's not bad.</span> <span id="s337">That's just the beginning.</span> <span id="s338">But later on when things really got bad, then there was nothing else to cling to.</span> <span id="s339">And I wonder if people understand that, that you can still be religious and believe in God even though you see what – let's say, what God is doing all around you.</span> <span id="s340">I don't want to have to explain what I just said.</span> <span id="s341">But on the one hand you see all the evil that – in our religious mind was still sent from God.</span> <span id="s342">And on the other hand, you come inward and you still believed he would help – and that was a big help.</span> <span id="s343">It really was.</span> <span id="s344">It sounds like an irony, but it was a big help.</span> <span id="s345">And then later on when I was rescued, and I found my father again.</span> <span id="s346">Then again also my mother and my whole family had died.</span> <span id="s347">Again there was at least that much reason to be grateful to God who had saved me, and had saved my father.</span> <span id="s348">And then I married a religious man.</span> <span id="s349">I tried to bring up my children religious.</span> <span id="s350">And it's a problem.</span> <span id="s351">You can't live without it and you can't live with it, but most of all you can't live without it.</span> <span id="s352">So it's a way of life now.</span> <span id="s353">It's a way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">01:31:22</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: When you got kicked out of Lyzeum, when you couldn't go anymore – when the Jewish children couldn't go – what was the decision of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s357">I remember that very well also.</span> <span id="s358">My sister was already old enough.</span> <span id="s359">First of all she had graduated.</span> <span id="s360">She was two years ahead of me.</span> <span id="s361">She had graduated from the Lyzeum and now she – there was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s362">There was no post-graduate or college or anything – forget it.</span> <span id="s363">She could either go to Hakhsharato prepare herself for Israel – for Palestine, but remember we were going with the last train so there was no need to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s364">We weren't leaving Ansbach.</span> <span id="s365">So she went to a girls Landwirtschaftschule– a girls preparation for... just to be a wife and a mother.</span> <span id="s366">It wasn't Landwirtschaftschule, it was Wolfratshausen.</span> <span id="s367">How can I explain it to you?</span> <span id="s368">It was a preparatory school for young women – for young ladies.</span> <span id="s369">I remember she came back and she showed me how she learned how to fold linens so that they would look like military in the shelves.</span> <span id="s370">You know, that's the kind of thing they learned.</span> <span id="s371">Much good that did us.</span> <span id="s372">And I was too young to go there, so I went to the one Jewish school that was still in existence.</span> <span id="s373">That was the Adass Jisroel Schule in Berlin.</span> <span id="s374">Now Berlin was far from Ansbach.</span> <span id="s375">It was like 300 kilometers and that was far.</span> <span id="s376">Remember, we're in 1930s in Europe.</span> <span id="s377">We're not in the l990s in America.</span> <span id="s378">Berlin was far and I didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s379">I had to live in the dormitory and I didn't know any kids.</span> <span id="s380">And now the bigger problem was that I didn't have the correct preparation for a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s381">I had only gone to my Rabbi during the section that was called “religion,” – “religion,” when the Catholics went to their priests and the Protestants went to their father, to their religious leader, we went to Elie Munk, to Rabbi Munk.</span> <span id="s382">And that's all the religious education we had that one hour a week where we had religion.</span> <span id="s383">So I was not prepared for that and of course I did very poorly.</span> <span id="s384">So that reinforced my thinking that I really was stupid and minor, even in the Jewish school I 17 Hakhshara He-Halutz [Pioneer Training] (Hebrew) 18 Agricultural school (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s385">19 Religion (German) couldn't excel, you see.</span> <span id="s386">So it was tough.</span> <span id="s387">And then I was called home after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s388">I remember driving through Berlin and seeing the synagogues in flames and all the glass on the streets and the people huddled and depressed.</span> <span id="s389">And it was very obvious that what had impacted upon me psychologically had impacted on all the Jews.</span> <span id="s390">They walked around like the victims – like the hunted.</span> <span id="s391">And I was in the train, and I was going toward Ansbach, and there my family had been taken to a collection center.</span> <span id="s392">Father had been sent to prison along with all the men.</span> <span id="s393">And Mother and all the women had already been sent back home and were packing.</span> <span id="s394">And we couldn't take more than we had that we could carry, and we had to leave everything.</span> <span id="s395">And I remember the name of the man that was just – just a very simple little fellow who was ordered by the Nazis to take over our house.</span> <span id="s396">And he already had moved in with his eight kids.</span> <span id="s397">And we were still packing and leaving and going to the railroad station, and then we realized really what was going on.</span> <span id="s398">Then Father didn't talk about the last train anymore.</span> <span id="s399">And, then we went – we could only go to certain cities.</span> <span id="s400">We couldn't just pick up and leave and buy a new house, or go to a new apartment – far from it.</span> <span id="s401">We were told which cities to go to and we were told to go to Munich, and we were also told to just find someone to live with.</span> <span id="s402">And we found a distant relative – well it doesn't matter – there was some relationship there, who took us into one spare room that they had.</span> <span id="s403">And then Father and all the uncles and cousins all came back, all their hair shorn.</span> <span id="s404">The Munich Jews had been sent to Dachau, whereas the Ansbach Jews had been sent to, to prison in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s405">And I remember how they all came back from the Dachau with their heads completely shorn, and then we began to wake up.</span> <span id="s406">Then we still only thought that the men were in danger.</span> <span id="s407">Who could think that they would kill women and children, or old people, or Rabbis, or respected business people or anything?</span> <span id="s408">So then Father was lucky and he got onto a convoy that the British Jews had organized and he got into that convoy as a butcher, and they went to Sandwich, England, to the Kitchener camps, with the hope – this was in July of 1939.</span> <span id="s409">There was no talk of war, yet.</span> <span id="s410">Hitler kept that very secret.</span> <span id="s411">It was – that was like a bombshell when the war started.</span> <span id="s412">So in July, a little more than one month before the beginning of the war in Poland, there was no fear of war.</span> <span id="s413">So we thought that my father could find domestic positions for us and bring us over after him.</span> <span id="s414">But the war ended that.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Do you think there was any talk of all of you going at once or could only the men go?</span> <span id="s416">01:37:33</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: That was only a transport for men from 18 to 45 years old and Father was just 45.</span> <span id="s418">It was a miracle he even got in.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: So your father's in England and you're all in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: So Father left.</span> <span id="s421">It was very traumatic because families were sacred – were holy.</span> <span id="s422">You didn't separate.</span> <span id="s423">You didn't divorce.</span> <span id="s424">That was not heard of.</span> <span id="s425">That was unheard of.</span> <span id="s426">You didn't leave your family.</span> <span id="s427">You didn't separate.</span> <span id="s428">You didn't leave your family alone.</span> <span id="s429">So that was very traumatic when my father left in that train in the railroad station in Munich.</span> <span id="s430">And my mother who was a typical Orthodox Jewish woman with a shaytelon and completely helpless.</span> <span id="s431">Everything she did – she ever did, she was told by her husband.</span> <span id="s432">People were like that.</span> <span id="s433">I know it sounds medieval, but they were married off as youngsters, completely naive and then they were told, "Your husband will tell you what to do."</span> <span id="s434">And my father always told her what to do.</span> <span id="s435">And all of a sudden she was alone.</span> <span id="s436">And I remember how devastated she was and how helpless at first.</span> <span id="s437">But then she had to learn.</span> <span id="s438">The money – the little bit of money that she received from the house was put into an account and she was only allowed a little sum every month.</span> <span id="s439">And she had to go and humiliate herself and beg for that – her own money – to get a little money so she could live another month.</span> <span id="s440">And then she sent us away.</span> <span id="s441">She sent my sister to Frankfurt, to the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s442">It was called Gagernstrasse.</span> <span id="s443">And I was a little too young to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s444">I was just old enough to be a baby nurse.</span> <span id="s445">And there's a division we don't have in this country, but I became a baby nurse.</span> <span id="s446">I was barely seventeen, and I was to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">01:39:49</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Can I go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s449">The day that your father left or the few days before when you knew that he was going to leave, did he talk with you in any particular way.</span> <span id="s450">Was there – or do you just – you remember the train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I remember the train station very vividly.</span> <span id="s452">I'm sure he talked with my mother, but the talk was not – not morbid.</span> <span id="s453">The goodbye was not like a final thing – like a finite goodbye.</span> <span id="s454">It was, "I'll do all I can to get you positions."</span> <span id="s455">And the British helped.</span> <span id="s456">The British Jews helped.</span> <span id="s457">And it worked for many people in that transport.</span> <span id="s458">Later on in New York I met many comrades of my father's who had gone with him into the transport and they were able to bring their wives and children, and mothers and fathers over to England still.</span> <span id="s459">But somehow it just didn't work for my father.</span> <span id="s460">After he died I found his notebook that he wrote.</span> <span id="s461">Every day he went and tried to find a family who would take us in.</span> <span id="s462">Of course he didn't speak English.</span> <span id="s463">He had no money.</span> <span id="s464">It just didn't work.</span> <span id="s465">But of course we also thought we had all the time in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">01:41:13</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: So your mother's decision was to get something practical for both of her daughters?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s469">Yes.</span> <span id="s470">And I remember she couldn't quite manage with money because she had only so little bit.</span> <span id="s471">So she went to a cousin of mine who still was there and he helped her out so that she could pay for me.</span> <span id="s472">It was such a small sum compared to now, but still she didn't have it.</span> <span id="s473">And so we left, and again it was – it was not a big goodbye.</span> <span id="s474">But as soon as I was in Berlin, then we had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s475">Then there was a law that we couldn't travel.</span> <span id="s476">Then there was a law we couldn't use telephones – public telephone stations.</span> <span id="s477">So all of a sudden we were completely cut off from her.</span> <span id="s478">No way of going back and no way of talking with her – just letters, letters, letters, letters.</span> <span id="s479">And she – the letters that she wrote to my father, she always tried to include letters from us.</span> <span id="s480">And my father gave me that whole bunch of letters.</span> <span id="s481">I still</span></p> <p><span id="s482">20 Wig (Yiddish) have it at home.</span> <span id="s483">First she writes – and she writes always the same – "How am I going to get out of here?</span> <span id="s484">What's my quota?</span> <span id="s485">Who is going to help me?</span> <span id="s486">How am I going to find the money to..." Just this grinding, grinding worry all the time.</span> <span id="s487">And then the one ray of sunshine, "And I include a letter from the children."</span> <span id="s488">So she always waited until she got mail from us, from my sister in Frankfurt and from me.</span> <span id="s489">And we wrote, more or less normal – how we enjoyed our training – especially I, I worked with children, you see.</span> <span id="s490">And my sister, how she liked being trained as a nurse and how interesting it was, and how she made friends.</span> <span id="s491">This was a new life for her.</span> <span id="s492">All of a sudden my sister had friends, and she could shine, and she was a great nurse.</span> <span id="s493">And she sent back a picture in her uniform.</span> <span id="s494">Now she too had a uniform.</span> <span id="s495">That was really something.</span> <span id="s496">Those were a couple of happy years that we had.</span> <span id="s497">And I too had a uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">01:43:31</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: So somehow or other, even the separations, and the restrictions being more heavier in some way, your life nevertheless was okay during those two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s501">Yes.</span> <span id="s502">I would say so.</span> <span id="s503">We wrote to my mother all the time and she wrote back.</span> <span id="s504">Of course to us she didn't write these – these heavy letters.</span> <span id="s505">To us she just told what she did and who she met and how she manages.</span> <span id="s506">For the first time in her life she was alone.</span> <span id="s507">She grew up in a family with five sisters.</span> <span id="s508">She was never, never, never alone.</span> <span id="s509">She never went to school or anything.</span> <span id="s510">And all of a sudden she was quite alone.</span> <span id="s511">That was traumatic.</span> <span id="s512">So she wrote what she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Did she remain in that apartment where you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yes – No.</span> <span id="s515">Those people left – those distant relatives.</span> <span id="s516">They all left.</span> <span id="s517">And I remember how she – how hurt she was.</span> <span id="s518">They all left kind of secretly.</span> <span id="s519">All of a sudden, you know.</span> <span id="s520">There was a great jealousy among the Jews against those who could leave and those who could not leave.</span> <span id="s521">And there was a great rivalry also you see.</span> <span id="s522">The ships’ places were very rare, and the quota was coveted – to be on the quota was heaven – to finally reach the quota.</span> <span id="s523">So the people who were lucky like that kept that very secret – very much to themselves.</span> <span id="s524">They didn't say.</span> <span id="s525">And then all of a sudden, this family left.</span> <span id="s526">I met them again years later in New York and that was a big blow to us.</span> <span id="s527">And we stuffed – they finally allowed us to put a few things into their lift – into their package – and that's how we saved a very few of our treasured things that weren't so valuable, but they were very much treasured by us.</span> <span id="s528">And when I met them again in New York, of course I was also... In a way we were very grateful for them.</span> <span id="s529">They had taken us in.</span> <span id="s530">But in another way we felt very hurt that they snuck out.</span> <span id="s531">So that apartment was confiscated by the Nazis and we had to find another Jewish family.</span> <span id="s532">Now it got much more difficult already.</span> <span id="s533">So there was this Frau Frankel(ph) who took us in, who had – her husband was still alive.</span> <span id="s534">And I met them later in Theresienstadt again.</span> <span id="s535">She and my mother then became friends.</span> <span id="s536">She was an elderly woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: So did your mother move in to Mrs. Frankel's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Frankel's house, yes.</span> <span id="s539">That was the only way you could live anywheres.</span> <span id="s540">You had to move in with someone.</span> <span id="s541">You couldn't rent an apartment – please.</span> <span id="s542">You have to think how this was now ‘39.</span> <span id="s543">Hitler was very outspoken what he was going to do with us.</span> <span id="s544">And that whole, that whole concentration into bigger cities, and to live with other Jews, that was nothing but a preparation for picking us up with greatest of ease to take us onto the deportations, you see.</span> <span id="s545">They didn't have to go anymore to the little farmhouses and to the little hamlets and to the little towns.</span> <span id="s546">They were already Judenrein.And you could see now, how that was a systematic concentration of the Jews – to pick them up and take them to the cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">01:47:33</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Were you in Berlin when your mother moved to Mrs. Frankel's?</span> <span id="s549">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No.</span> <span id="s552">No.</span> <span id="s553">I still moved with her to Mrs. Frankel's, and my sister also.</span> <span id="s554">And that was just one room, you see.</span> <span id="s555">So, in a way, it was great to go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s556">In a way I said goodbye to her with the greatest of joy.</span> <span id="s557">She was with Mrs. Frankel.</span> <span id="s558">I knew she wasn't all alone.</span> <span id="s559">And I was looking forward – we were still thinking we'd have a life.</span> <span id="s560">We weren't, we weren't aware that we were all – that was the last year, or last two years of our lives.</span> <span id="s561">I was looking forward to being a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: How did your mother get along during the time when you were away?</span> <span id="s563">Did she...?</span> <span id="s564">Did she have...?</span> <span id="s565">There was no work.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: She volunteered a little.</span> <span id="s567">She volunteered in the old age home.</span> <span id="s568">This was before deportation.</span> <span id="s569">In fact my mother was on the first train out of Munich.</span> <span id="s570">But we didn't know from deportation at that point.</span> <span id="s571">The word was unknown to us “Deportation” did that mean?</span> <span id="s572">And the other word – the other term that was used was “Arbeitstransport.”</span> <span id="s573">Those were all – there was a whole new terminology coming up that meant very little to us.</span> <span id="s574">“Judenrein,” “Judenfrage,” “Lösung der Judenfrage.”</span> <span id="s575">You know, there were “Osttransport.”</span> <span id="s576">What did that mean?</span> <span id="s577">So “Deportation” was not a word that was heard of when I left my mother.</span> <span id="s578">I thought she would stay there.</span> <span id="s579">Now, by then, – no, not yet.</span> <span id="s580">A little later Father got to America.</span> <span id="s581">And then – yes, Father already had gotten to America in ‘39.</span> <span id="s582">He was shipped out very quickly.</span> <span id="s583">And that was – now we're talking about 1940.</span> <span id="s584">Mother is alone and the letters that she writes to Father, 21 Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe areas that had been completely purged of their Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">22 Jewish question (German) 23 Answer to the Jewish question (German) 24 East transport (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s586">25 Deportation (German) which Father gave me later on so I'm very much in the picture what was happening through those letters.</span> <span id="s587">Now she goes to the immigration station daily, daily, daily.</span> <span id="s588">That was her daily work – to see if she could get out.</span> <span id="s589">And he in America was begging for money to buy the visa and to buy the ship's cards for the three of us.</span> <span id="s590">And still there was this thinking that the three of us would stay together.</span> <span id="s591">And then in one letter, that's like an – that's like an, like an epiphany already.</span> <span id="s592">In one letter she writes, and that was already very late when it was already much too late – she writes, "Siegfried, don't try to get the three of us out.</span> <span id="s593">Just get the children out.</span> <span id="s594">Forget about me," she says.</span> <span id="s595">So then she volunteered a little bit in an old age home.</span> <span id="s596">And then in 1941, when she was 45 years old, she got into Transport.</span> <span id="s597">By then I was in Berlin at the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s598">And then my sister also ended up in Berlin because the Gagernstrasse was closed.</span> <span id="s599">And for a short while we were together.</span> <span id="s600">And even when she goes into the transport, the last letter to my father she says, "Don't worry about me.</span> <span id="s601">I'll be okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Everybody else is going too.</span> <span id="s603">And I'm packing all my warm clothes.</span> <span id="s604">And I'll see you when all this is over."</span> <span id="s605">Now we can talk about Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">01:51:41</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Did you find out about your mother going on the transport soon after she–?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: No.</span> <span id="s609">I found out that she was going in the transport just before she went.</span> <span id="s610">She called us.</span> <span id="s611">She had to go to a public – she had to go to the Jewish Community to use the phone.</span> <span id="s612">She was not allowed into a public phone.</span> <span id="s613">So she could call us in the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s614">We still had a phone.</span> <span id="s615">And then we had to call her back, pre-arranged, that she'd be at the Jewish Community in Munich.</span> <span id="s616">And she – first we tried to go with her.</span> <span id="s617">And number one, we couldn't get onto a train, we already wore the star.</span> <span id="s618">And, and number two, she said, "Don't go with me."</span> <span id="s619">She says, “There's no use.</span> <span id="s620">I'll work, and what's the use?"</span> <span id="s621">And then somehow she knew that the transport was going to Riga.</span> <span id="s622">That was on the 11th of November – on the ninth of November, 1941.</span> <span id="s623">It was one of the very first transports out of Germany.</span> <span id="s624">That was before, that was before the Wannsee Conference, when the killing was not really automatic yet.</span> <span id="s625">And still, in Riga, as I later found out, they were killed as soon as they got there.</span> <span id="s626">But still we hoped that we would see each other again.</span> <span id="s627">We had no idea that they were killed right away.</span> <span id="s628">When I got to Theresienstadt, I was so happy.</span> <span id="s629">I thought I would find my mother.</span> <span id="s630">I would find people again.</span> <span id="s631">We didn't know there was such a widespread transport system “Lagersystem.”</span> <span id="s632">We thought, "Well," you know, "Everybody will see each other again."</span></p> <p><span id="s633">01:53:50</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So now your sister comes to Berlin from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s635">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: The whole group of the Gagernstrasse Hospital from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s637">First there were deportations out of there.</span> <span id="s638">And then when the hospital got smaller and smaller, it was closed.</span> <span id="s639">And the 26 Camp system (German) remaining people all came to Berlin to work Zwangsarbeit,forced labor at the Siemens factory.</span> <span id="s640">To this day I can't buy anything from Siemens, believe me.</span> <span id="s641">So my sister was one of them.</span> <span id="s642">And later on that whole group went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s643">But for a short while we were together and we could see each other on our days off.</span> <span id="s644">We couldn't use the U-Bahnor the City Bahntransportation or anything.</span> <span id="s645">We had to walk.</span> <span id="s646">We had to walk with our star.</span> <span id="s647">And one of the thousands of laws that concerned us, that are really not well known, was that Jews could not walk in any greenery, in any park, in anything that was planted and was pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">That was for Aryans only.</span> <span id="s649">So where there was a park – the Tiergarten– and no matter what we had to walk around it.</span> <span id="s650">We couldn't go through it.</span> <span id="s651">So I remember walking and walking and walking to visit her and then walking back.</span> <span id="s652">And we had to be home at a certain hour, so it was very restricted.</span> <span id="s653">The Berlin years were difficult years.</span> <span id="s654">The Ansbach years were mostly happy, and the Munich years were ignorance.</span> <span id="s655">Dominant emotion was naiveté.</span> <span id="s656">What was going on we had no idea and still a lot of hope.</span> <span id="s657">But Berlin and our eyes were opened and all the many laws that we had to respect that Hitler made.</span> <span id="s658">The whole, the whole Lösung der Judenfrage – the whole deportation of the Jews was done legally.</span> <span id="s659">That's the ironic part.</span> <span id="s660">First he made a law, then he killed us.</span> <span id="s661">You see?</span> <span id="s662">But how did we know that?</span> <span id="s663">We knew the law and we tried to live with it.</span> <span id="s664">Then we already were, were very much the victims.</span> <span id="s665">We looked very bad.</span> <span id="s666">We had no more – we couldn't get clothing coupons.</span> <span id="s667">I remember we couldn't get coupons to have our shoes repaired.</span> <span id="s668">So we walked around in shoes that were ready to be thrown out.</span> <span id="s669">We couldn't get new ones.</span> <span id="s670">That's without even saying.</span> <span id="s671">But we couldn't get our old ones repaired either.</span> <span id="s672">So we had no clothes.</span> <span id="s673">We had bad shoes.</span> <span id="s674">We were not well nourished.</span> <span id="s675">We had the star.</span> <span id="s676">We didn't need the star.</span> <span id="s677">We marked as victims from the inside out, and from the outside as well.</span> <span id="s678">Where as they got better and better – well fed and more victorious, and more triumphant every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">01:57:03 In the hospital, first I was in Niedershönhausen and then that was dissolved, and then I went in Berlin.</span> <span id="s680">I'm telling you how bad everything was, and yet there was that little nucleus of happiness still, you know.</span> <span id="s681">We were among Jews.</span> <span id="s682">We could talk with them.</span> <span id="s683">We had our own little kingdom.</span> <span id="s684">We had our own little hierarchy.</span> <span id="s685">I was just a student nurse.</span> <span id="s686">I was nobody, but the hierarchy went to the Head Nurse, and it was heaven when the Head Nurse was friendly with you, which was not the case in my case.</span> <span id="s687">I never got enough self-confidence up to talk to a head nurse, and she wasn't that much older than I was.</span> <span id="s688">And then, of course, there was the whole hierarchy – all the physicians that seemed like demigods.</span> <span id="s689">And then there was the whole god; that was Lustig – Dr. Lustig – Dr. Walter Lustig.</span> <span id="s690">He had two Doctors.</span> <span id="s691">He called himself Doctor Doctor Walter Lustig.</span> <span id="s692">He was a very prominent Jew before the Nazis came.</span> <span id="s693">He was married to an Aryan woman – to an Aryan physician woman and that was why he was saved for quite a while.</span> <span id="s694">I'll get back to Lustig in a minute, but as you know the Mischlin 27 Forced labor (German) 28 Untergrund Bahn [Underground train] (German); Subway.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">29 Train (German) 30 Zoological garden (German) – the Mischeheand the Mischlingewere a big problem to Hitler, and in fact the hospital remained in existence because of that problem of the Mischlinge and the Mischehe.</span> <span id="s696">They couldn't divorce.</span> <span id="s697">The Pope didn't allow that, and Hitler couldn't treat the Aryan person as a Jew, and he couldn't really accept the Jew as an Aryan, so he tolerated them.</span> <span id="s698">And it was always a.… I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the Mischlinge.</span> <span id="s699">That was obviously a thorn in his side.</span> <span id="s700">And the children of those Mischlinge were also a big problem.</span> <span id="s701">And Theresienstadt was partly organized for those Mischlinge.</span> <span id="s702">They couldn't very well go into their death.</span> <span id="s703">After all, in many cases they had a pure Aryan father or... who was fighting for Hitler on the front.</span> <span id="s704">So anyway, Lustig was married to an Aryan woman and he got the job as leader of the Jewish hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Let's break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">01:59:58 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s707">31 Intermarriage (German) 32 Mixed breed (German); Nazi term used for individuals of mixed Jewish and non-Jewish heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s709">02:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: It's so long ago.</span> <span id="s711">It still gets to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: You can see it in your eyes.</span> <span id="s713">You were back there.</span> <span id="s714">You were seeing what was happening.</span> <span id="s715">So that’s not….</span> <span id="s716">Okay.</span> <span id="s717">Mrs. Haas, can you talk a little bit more about what was going on with your sister at Siemens, the kind of work she was doing – what you talked about – what her condition was at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: As much as I can remember.</span> <span id="s719">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s720">I was of course involved in my own work at the time?</span> <span id="s721">When she first came to Berlin I was still in Niedershönhausen and I remember the Head Nurse of Niedershönhausen who was a lovely old lady, whom I was very attached to, used to invite my sister on her day off to come to me because my sister lived in – they all lived together in a big room.</span> <span id="s722">Very Spartan, nothing there at all, just beds and a chair or what have you.</span> <span id="s723">So it wasn't much fun to spend the day off there.</span> <span id="s724">So the Oberschwester,the Head Nurse of Niedershönhausen – as much as I loved her I forgot her name now, I don't recall her name – invited my sister.</span> <span id="s725">So my sister walked.</span> <span id="s726">And I remember the Head Nurse then instructed the kitchen to serve my sister and me a fried egg.</span> <span id="s727">Now that – need I say more?</span> <span id="s728">In 1940, the end of 1940, we were each eating a fried egg in Berlin.</span> <span id="s729">I remember how much that meant to us, and also nutritionally, my sister was very much down.</span> <span id="s730">They didn't have good food and they worked very hard.</span> <span id="s731">They did factory work.</span> <span id="s732">I don't exactly know what they did.</span> <span id="s733">She never talked about it.</span> <span id="s734">But in one of the letters to my mother – and then she sent it to my father – she writes that she has been chosen to be the camp nurse – that she's taking care of the little injuries, etc., etc., and that apparently was quite an advantage for her, and she was very proud of it also.</span> <span id="s735">And then all of a sudden they were detailed into a transport and I don't recall too much about that.</span> <span id="s736">I remember going to her dormitory at the Siemens factory and they had left.</span> <span id="s737">There was this empty big room with nothing there.</span> <span id="s738">There was one hat that I remember she wore and that was sitting on her bed, and I took that hat and walked back home.</span> <span id="s739">I don't recall my emotions or anything.</span> <span id="s740">I probably blocked them out and, again, the hope was that we would all see each other when we all got deported.</span> <span id="s741">That was always the one “glimmer” of the deportation.</span> <span id="s742">We always thought we would see each other again.</span> <span id="s743">We would also get there – like death, and you see your people again up in heaven, but that was not the way it worked – was the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">02:04:35</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Was she more frightened than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I think she was a lot more realistic than I was.</span> <span id="s747">I, after all, lived in a little Jewish nucleus in the middle of Nazism.</span> <span id="s748">We were served our meals.</span> <span id="s749">We didn't have to go scrounging around or 33 Head nurse (German) go to the grocery stores, which by that time already were restricted.</span> <span id="s750">The Jews could only go to certain grocery stores in the city during certain hours, and buy only certain things with their rations.</span> <span id="s751">That was all spared to me.</span> <span id="s752">We got our meals served and we didn't much ask where they came from.</span> <span id="s753">So I was much better off.</span> <span id="s754">Her rations – she worked hard and I think her rations were minimal because I remember so clearly how she enjoyed that egg.</span> <span id="s755">So she must have had very poor food.</span> <span id="s756">And I don't remember too much.</span> <span id="s757">I remember that we wrote to my father a lot when we got together and I don't, I don't remember what we wrote, but I know what we wrote from reading the letters 30 years later and she writes – I remember especially in one letter she writes, “Kann denn niemand etwas für uns tun?”</span> <span id="s758">“Can't anybody do anything for us?"</span> <span id="s759">We had, after all by then, the major part of our family here and one part of the family in particular that moved to Argentina with all their money didn't help us at all.</span> <span id="s760">And I've never quite forgiven them that.</span> <span id="s761">They could have helped us.</span> <span id="s762">They had the money and we could have gone into Argentina.</span> <span id="s763">The quota wasn't that strict.</span> <span id="s764">And I remember especially from her letter, “Kann dem Tante Lina garnichts für uns tun?”</span> <span id="s765">– “Can't Aunt Lina" – who was the one there – "do anything for us."</span> <span id="s766">So she was much more realistic than I was.</span> <span id="s767">I didn't write such things.</span> <span id="s768">I only wrote about my nursing and my friends that I made and how much I liked it, and things like that.</span> <span id="s769">She was much more with the times than I was.</span> <span id="s770">And Aunt Lina unfortunately did nothing either.</span> <span id="s771">That was very, very sad that my own family didn't gather around and pulled out as much as, as many as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">02:07:13</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Why do you think in the Jewish Community Hospital that you were working in, that the food was simply available and you were getting a better diet?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Well I think it was simply because they were a big institution and – I don't know.</span> <span id="s775">I never wondered.</span> <span id="s776">It never occurred to me to wonder.</span> <span id="s777">But we actually still had kosher food.</span> <span id="s778">That was the amazing part.</span> <span id="s779">That whole business with the Jewish hospital is very intriguing indeed, and I'm doing some research on it now.</span> <span id="s780">Up to my deportation in ‘43, there was a kosher kitchen in the Jewish hospital, which is phenomenal.</span> <span id="s781">And there were a few people, one of the housekeepers, a couple of the physicians and several of the nurses, who trotted there every meal time and got their kosher meals served, so how?</span> <span id="s782">I don't know where they got it from.</span> <span id="s783">And why the Jewish hospital remained in existence and was – never even the name changed, Das Jüdische Krankenhausit was called – and on Iranische Strassenumber two – and it's still there.</span> <span id="s784">You can still go there and see the same building – rebuilt.</span> <span id="s785">It was bombed out after I left.</span> <span id="s786">And now I haven't done the research yet, so whatever my opinions are at the moment are my own speculations.</span> <span id="s787">I think, number one, Lustig, Dr. Lustig was very much in with the Nazi supervision of the hospital.</span> <span id="s788">He was as much of a puppet as anybody else of course.</span> <span id="s789">And I am still friendly with one of the nurses now that was there, and she was 34 Can’t anyone do anything for us?</span> <span id="s790">(German) 35 Can Aunt Lina do nothing for us?</span> <span id="s791">(German) 36 The Jewish Hospital (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s792">37 Street (German) friendly with him.</span> <span id="s793">And she tells of the story which I totally believe, which is completely within the context of what I remembered.</span> <span id="s794">She says many times she would be with him and he would answer the telephone with, "Hello.</span> <span id="s795">Dr. Lustig," and he would immediately put it down again.</span> <span id="s796">Then the phone would ring again and he would say, “Der Jude Lustig, hier.”</span> <span id="s797">You see.</span> <span id="s798">They didn't accept if he just... If they were calling him, they didn't want just “Dr. Lustig.”</span> <span id="s799">They wanted “Der Jude Lustig, hier.”</span> <span id="s800">So he was a puppet.</span> <span id="s801">There's no question about it.</span> <span id="s802">Within the Jews he was all powerful naturally.</span> <span id="s803">He was the one that made up the lists.</span> <span id="s804">He was the one that put cross checks on who should go into transports of nurses, doctors, personnel, patients.</span> <span id="s805">He was the all powerful one.</span> <span id="s806">But within the context of the Nazis, he was a puppet.</span> <span id="s807">He was nothing.</span> <span id="s808">He did their doing.</span> <span id="s809">And if he didn't, he was the one that was punished.</span> <span id="s810">So, it's hard to know how to judge him.</span> <span id="s811">I'm tempted to judge him benevolently.</span> <span id="s812">Many people hated him.</span> <span id="s813">Many people feared him.</span> <span id="s814">He – of course, you know he was such a powerful man, stories build up.</span> <span id="s815">And I remember so well, when we first came to the hospital, we were in Niedershönhausen, student – we were 17, 18 years old.</span> <span id="s816">And again I have to caution you to realize what that meant back in the 30s and in Berlin we were so, so simple, so naive.</span> <span id="s817">And then when we were transferred to the big hospital, the rumor went that, "Dr. Lustig will inspect all the student nurses completely naked.</span> <span id="s818">And only the ones that he likes naked he would take in."</span> <span id="s819">Of course it was a stupid rumor, and it did not occur at all, but that was his, his aura.</span> <span id="s820">That was his reputation.</span> <span id="s821">He was all powerful.</span> <span id="s822">He could demand anything he wanted and we had to do it.</span> <span id="s823">But it wasn't so.</span> <span id="s824">He was just a very nice man.</span> <span id="s825">He was very powerful, yes, but also quite nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">02:11:37</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Did you have direct dealings with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: No, I never did.</span> <span id="s829">No, I never did.</span> <span id="s830">But the nurses that – he had many girlfriends among the nurses.</span> <span id="s831">And the general rule was to try to be very friendly with his girlfriends And I never managed that.</span> <span id="s832">And I always felt very ostracized and very badly.</span> <span id="s833">We lived in the nursing home and we nurses, of course, chummed together.</span> <span id="s834">And you have to realize I am still friendly with some of these people.</span> <span id="s835">My best friend – my best girlfriend whom I liked so much then, and whom I still like so much now.</span> <span id="s836">We're both in our 70s, but we're still like kids together – and again, an example of how naive we were.</span> <span id="s837">She and I roomed together in Niedershönhausen, and we were working hard.</span> <span id="s838">We had seven to seven shifts – seven in the morning to seven at night, or vice versa.</span> <span id="s839">And then after the shift we had to do our theoretical work, and we were tired.</span> <span id="s840">So we went into bed with each other, studied for a while, and then fell asleep just to save time.</span> <span id="s841">And we still chuckle over that, you know.</span> <span id="s842">We tell it to our husbands.</span> <span id="s843">And in the morning, we were woken up by the night nurses because we didn't wake up by ourselves at all – forget it – and they found us in bed together.</span> <span id="s844">Well, we were called before the, the Leiter– I think back to German, to the German things – I sometimes 38 The Jew Lustig, here.</span> <span id="s845">(German) 39 The Jew Lustig, here.</span> <span id="s846">(German) 40 Director (German) miss my English – to the administrator of the Niedershönhausen Institution, and he scolded us, you know.</span> <span id="s847">But we didn't know why.</span> <span id="s848">We didn't know what we had done wrong.</span> <span id="s849">He thought we were fooling around together.</span> <span id="s850">That was the furthest thing from our minds.</span> <span id="s851">This just to show you how very naive we were.</span> <span id="s852">So here was that rumor we had to be undressed and we were fearful like anything, but it didn't happen.</span> <span id="s853">So then the next thing was we had to be friendly with the girlfriends of Lustig.</span> <span id="s854">And somehow she managed it and I didn't.</span> <span id="s855">And then we got together in the evening in our nursing dormitories and she would tell me everything – whatever was going on.</span> <span id="s856">They joked and they made friends and they laughed and they talked about the patients and the doctors.</span> <span id="s857">And I felt terrible.</span> <span id="s858">I never was included.</span> <span id="s859">And now I'm not so sorry anymore because this particular Head Nurse was not a very fine person.</span> <span id="s860">She then fraternized with the SS, and I'm not a bit sorry that I was not one of her friends.</span> <span id="s861">The SS man at the Jewish hospital was Döbberke(ph) – SS man Döbberke, and he was feared.</span> <span id="s862">He walked around and he would send us into transport on his own without going through Lustig.</span> <span id="s863">If the star wasn't sewed on nicely, or if he could smell cigarettes on our breath, or if we didn't stand up and greet him properly, or for any old reason, he would take us into transport.</span> <span id="s864">And I heard later on, after I left, that this particular Head Nurse from the – from the Kinderstation– her nurse's name was Elly(ph), SchwesterElly, she then became his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s865">And that was not something that sits easily with any of us.</span> <span id="s866">That was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">02:15:35</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: When you say that Lustig had girlfriends, you mean – you don't mean they were simply friends.</span> <span id="s869">You mean that they were his–</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: They were his girlfriends.</span> <span id="s871">They slept with him.</span> <span id="s872">Q: So there were a number of nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s874">That was known knowledge.</span> <span id="s875">We didn't think much of that.</span> <span id="s876">We just stayed away.</span> <span id="s877">I mean we who were still so rural and especially we who were religious, you know, we just stayed away, you know.</span> <span id="s878">We had nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: And what was your friend's name in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Golly – my friend Golly.</span> <span id="s881">I'm still very friendly with her.</span> <span id="s882">She then – you ought to get her and get her story sometime.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: How come she became friends with these girlfriends and you didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: She was just a very – She was a Mischlinge, first of all.</span> <span id="s885">She was a very outgoing, lovely, very much liked person.</span> <span id="s886">And she was just a very sweet person.</span> <span id="s887">She and I liked each other 41 Children’s ward (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s888">42 Nurse (German) very much.</span> <span id="s889">We were very opposite from each other.</span> <span id="s890">She was so blond and outgoing, and I was much more heavy and the worrying type.</span> <span id="s891">And we just needed each other.</span> <span id="s892">We were just very friendly.</span> <span id="s893">She didn't put much stock into her acceptance into that inner circle at all.</span> <span id="s894">She was a very wonderful girl and she – they liked her a lot, so they took her in.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">02:17:03</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Could you explain the structure of the hospital.</span> <span id="s897">What was going on, before we get into some particular things?</span> <span id="s898">Was the SS man there every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I wasn't so much aware of that.</span> <span id="s900">I don't know.</span> <span id="s901">Later on, after I left, I heard that he was there every day – that he actually lived somewheres there in one of the buildings – that same Döbberke.</span> <span id="s902">But while I was there, the thing I remember most, we had constant visits from the SS I remember Eichmanncoming through many times – young, beautiful, smoking his cigarette, sleeked through like, like sleeked up with tongues almost – not a speck on him – and very arrogant.</span> <span id="s903">And we had to stand up and leave whatever we were doing and stand while he was in the room.</span> <span id="s904">And then he left again – just harassing us and doing what he thought was wonderful, was great, harassing the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">02:18:14</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: And how did you know that this was Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: We knew that.</span> <span id="s908">We knew that.</span> <span id="s909">We met him again then – he, he – you see he, which I didn't know then, he was in charge of the whole Amt4B, the whole Jewish section – he and Murse(ph), but that, you know, we didn't know that.</span> <span id="s910">But we just knew that he was constantly on our necks.</span> <span id="s911">That was his job.</span> <span id="s912">By then I believe the Jewish Community was already dissolved and so he had only us to play around with, and he did that job very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: So you're in the hospital seven in the morning until...</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s915">We had 12 hour duties.</span> <span id="s916">Then I was already a full nurse.</span> <span id="s917">I graduated.</span> <span id="s918">And then I was an employee of the hospital.</span> <span id="s919">In October, 1941 I got my diploma and it says on it, “Jüdische Säuglings und Kleinkinder Schwester."</span> <span id="s920">Now I have to switch into English, "Permitted to work only with Jewish children and babies," you see.</span> <span id="s921">That was the restriction.</span> <span id="s922">I could not go out anywheres and get a job.</span> <span id="s923">It was just for the Jews.</span> <span id="s924">I still have that as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s925">And then I was an employee.</span> <span id="s926">I drew a salary and I worked on the Kinderstation – on the baby – on the children's station, not on the baby station.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: And you were living in the hospital all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">43 Adolf Eichmann</span></p> <p><span id="s929">44 Bureau (German) 45 Jewish Infants and Toddlers Nurse (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: In the hospital.</span> <span id="s931">And then we also had duties for a few Jewish, like daycare centers that were around the city, and we got a special permit to go to these centers as nurses and take care of the children, but they were resolved very soon afterwards.</span> <span id="s932">But that was part of our nursing duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: So could you explain what a day might be like?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: As much as I remember.</span> <span id="s935">We got up in the morning and went to the Speisesaal.We had a dormitory kind of a living where we lived and we called it der Reitsall– the horses station, it was so big you know.</span> <span id="s936">And Golly and I roomed close together, and we had to put our uniforms on, sew on the yellow star very quickly and neatly – it didn't leave any holes in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: You mean daily you had to sew on the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Whenever we changed the uniform.</span> <span id="s939">We got two stars that we had to buy from the Jewish Community for zehn Pfennigs,for 10 pennies, and we better take care of them.</span> <span id="s940">If we didn't have them, forget it, we were shot.</span> <span id="s941">And then we went to have breakfast, and then we started to work – whatever our duties use to be.</span> <span id="s942">The children were in long rows of beds and we were assigned to maybe six children that were ours that we had to take care of the whole day long.</span> <span id="s943">And then the doctors would come in and we had to report on the kids.</span> <span id="s944">It wasn't so sophisticated.</span> <span id="s945">Don't think we knew all that much.</span> <span id="s946">And then at noontime we had, I don't recall – I guess we went back to the Speisesaal for lunch, and then the inner circle always went into Schwester Elly's little room and smoked cigarettes with the doors closed.</span> <span id="s947">And then in the evening we went and had supper again.</span> <span id="s948">And we couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s949">There was a curfew.</span> <span id="s950">We had to be there at eight – back at eight.</span> <span id="s951">So everything that we did, we did within the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">And the hospital was a complex – a whole compound.</span> <span id="s953">So we did get out for fresh air just by walking across the halls, across the – to the different buildings.</span> <span id="s954">And of course there were little romances with the young physicians.</span> <span id="s955">Everything was so – it was so enclosed.</span> <span id="s956">It was so unnatural you see.</span> <span id="s957">It was – everything was so confined.</span> <span id="s958">So naturally romances sprung up and died down again, and many people left on transports, and once they were here one day and the next day they were gone.</span> <span id="s959">We somehow got use to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">02:22:41</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Did you also have a boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: I was friendly with one of the physicians.</span> <span id="s963">I wouldn't say he was a boyfriend, but I was friendly with one of the physicians.</span> <span id="s964">Golly was very friendly with one of the physicians.</span> <span id="s965">And one of the other nurses was very much involved with one of the housekeep– one of the male 46 Dinning hall (German) 47 The riding stable (German) 48 Ten pfennigs (German) housekeepers – and finally married.</span> <span id="s966">There were marriages.</span> <span id="s967">There were marriages there.</span> <span id="s968">So in a way, as unnatural as it sounded, it was still a fairly normal existence.</span> <span id="s969">Well, I'm gonna take that back.</span> <span id="s970">It wasn't normal with people disappearing every day to go on transports.</span> <span id="s971">And then many people made secret plans to go underground.</span> <span id="s972">That was a big deal.</span> <span id="s973">And many people made secret plans to go across the border into Switzerland, and many were caught.</span> <span id="s974">And then also I'm going to take back what I said – that it was a normal life – because it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Because the patients we got, most of them were suicides that we had to get back to life in order so we could ship them to the collection center to be going to transports.</span> <span id="s976">And you know we sat and agonized over that.</span> <span id="s977">Is it really our duty to bring those people back to life?</span> <span id="s978">But, yes it was, or we were punished ourselves.</span> <span id="s979">The SS were always there to supervise us and do this.</span> <span id="s980">It was a very unnatural time, and always the fear that we would be the next ones to have the transport notice, and it was just a very bad time.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Did you work on the patients who came in?</span> <span id="s982">A: No.</span> <span id="s983">I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: You were working with the children–</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: But the physician that I was friendly with was somebody in charge of that, and he always told about it.</span> <span id="s986">And you know it was always food for conversation.</span> <span id="s987">What are we gonna talk about, you know, and so what could we possibly talk about?</span> <span id="s988">We couldn't go to a movie.</span> <span id="s989">We didn't know nothing of concerts, or any of the culture that normal people grow up with.</span> <span id="s990">We couldn't go shopping.</span> <span id="s991">We didn't have any new clothes to show off.</span> <span id="s992">What are we going to talk about?</span> <span id="s993">Transports and going underground, and we had no family left.</span> <span id="s994">We couldn't talk about family anymore, so we talked about that all the time.</span> <span id="s995">It was like ruminating – the same thing all the time.</span> <span id="s996">It was a very unnatural life actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">02:25:19</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Who were the children that you took care of?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Those were children from the Jewish Community that were sick.</span> <span id="s1000">And, little by little, that changed, and little by little it was Mischlinge that came in – children of mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s1001">And then by ‘43 I left.</span> <span id="s1002">And little by little the whole complex of the nurses, and the whole complexion of the staff changed too.</span> <span id="s1003">We were replaced by Mischlinge – by people who were from mixed marriages with whom they didn't know what to do with.</span> <span id="s1004">They couldn't put them on the lists yet.</span> <span id="s1005">They did later.</span> <span id="s1006">In fact, this nice Dr. Elkan(ph) that I was friendly with dumped me for a Mischlinge.</span> <span id="s1007">I never forgot and forgave him.</span> <span id="s1008">It was just as well.</span> <span id="s1009">It was just as well.</span> <span id="s1010">There was no time to form emotional bondages.</span> <span id="s1011">And in fact I – she came to this country, too.</span> <span id="s1012">I corresponded with her for a while.</span> <span id="s1013">You formed such weird friendships – such weird relationships – and they lasted.</span> <span id="s1014">They really lasted.</span> <span id="s1015">I was very friendly with, with – not the Head Nurse, but the one that came under her.</span> <span id="s1016">I don't know what you would call her – maybe the Assistant Head Nurse – Schwester Lea(ph).</span> <span id="s1017">And we picked each other up again here in this country.</span> <span id="s1018">We had really nothing in common otherwise, but that huge balloon of memories.</span> <span id="s1019">We could talk with each other and it was like in the comic strips, you know, over our heads was the same picture.</span> <span id="s1020">You see?</span> <span id="s1021">Was so weird.</span> <span id="s1022">And then Golly would come in and over her head was the same picture, and we would talk about that.</span> <span id="s1023">Does that give you some idea what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">02:27:31</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: It was a particular intensity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: It was very intense.</span> <span id="s1027">When finally, when I got my notice, I was glad.</span> <span id="s1028">It was like, "finally."</span> <span id="s1029">And then an SS man came, and I was on his list, and he came to the station where I was working.</span> <span id="s1030">It was in the middle of the day, when he told me that I was on his list.</span> <span id="s1031">And he took me to my room in the dormitory, and everybody had their, their rucksack packed.</span> <span id="s1032">My rucksack was packed, and he gave me just a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1033">He timed me.</span> <span id="s1034">And then I had to go into that van that was downstairs.</span> <span id="s1035">And it was like, “finally,” you know – “finally I can go.”</span> <span id="s1036">‘Cause I knew I would be going.</span> <span id="s1037">I knew I wasn't going to go underground.</span> <span id="s1038">I had no chance, and I wasn't going to do that anyway.</span> <span id="s1039">And I couldn't get into Switzerland over the border.</span> <span id="s1040">I was completely alone.</span> <span id="s1041">Everybody had left already.</span> <span id="s1042">Father was in America.</span> <span id="s1043">Mother was in Riga – or so I thought.</span> <span id="s1044">My sister in Auschwitz – or so I thought.</span> <span id="s1045">And I thought I was coming to Auschwitz as well.</span> <span id="s1046">There was no idea I was going to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1047">Everybody was going to Auschwitz – to Arbeitstransport or Osttransport.</span> <span id="s1048">It wasn't called killing transport by any means.</span> <span id="s1049">And so I thought I would see them all again.</span> <span id="s1050">So I was very relieved.</span> <span id="s1051">And I went into that transport without a minute looking back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">02:29:01</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Before we get on the transport, even though you brought us there, let's go back a little to the situation and how it changes in Berlin with respect to your being brought to some assembly place and selections are being done – so some people are chosen to leave – and then you keep going back to work.</span> <span id="s1054">And what was that like?</span> <span id="s1055">What was happening with this constantly being brought back, and then you go back to work again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Are you talking about when we were called to the Jewish Community Center?</span> <span id="s1057">Q: Umm [affirmative].</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Oh, that was difficult.</span> <span id="s1059">And then Lustig was also very much involved.</span> <span id="s1060">All these Befehle,all these SS orders to do things came through Lustig.</span> <span id="s1061">The SS never spoke to anyone else, you see.</span> <span id="s1062">He was their man.</span> <span id="s1063">So Lustig let it be known throughout the hospital – that was in October of ‘42, that – up to then it was sort of, you know, it was sort of dispersed.</span> <span id="s1064">But now, all of sudden, it got general.</span> <span id="s1065">It got bunched up together – that we were all going to be</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">49 Order (German) appearing the next morning at seven o'clock in full uniforms at the Jewish Community Center on Oranien Strasse .</span> <span id="s1067">And that was a big room.</span> <span id="s1068">We got there of course.</span> <span id="s1069">There was no way we would not go there.</span> <span id="s1070">It didn't occur to us not to go.</span> <span id="s1071">That's another thing.</span> <span id="s1072">We were so conditioned to obey.</span> <span id="s1073">If I look at those kids nowadays, they refuse to obey their mothers, or their teachers, or their governors, or their President... It was the furthest thing from our minds not to obey an order, you see.</span> <span id="s1074">And when I speak to students, I always encourage them to continue doing that.</span> <span id="s1075">So we obeyed.</span> <span id="s1076">We went in our uniform with our star, seven o'clock in the morning, the whole bunch of us, and it was a big room, and we just stood there.</span> <span id="s1077">We didn't know why.</span> <span id="s1078">We had no idea why we were called.</span> <span id="s1079">Lustig didn't tell us and nobody else knew.</span> <span id="s1080">And we stood and we stood, and it was, we couldn't go to the toilet, we couldn't get any coffee, and I'm quickly reaching for my nice cup of tea so it won't be taken away from me.</span> <span id="s1081">We were desperate.</span> <span id="s1082">At 12 o'clock, three SS men showed up.</span> <span id="s1083">We knew Eichmann.</span> <span id="s1084">He was very familiar to us.</span> <span id="s1085">We also knew Günther.He was also familiar.</span> <span id="s1086">There were two SS Günthers – one from Berlin and one from Prague.</span> <span id="s1087">This was Günther from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1088">And then there were three Jews from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1089">And then there was an SS man whom we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">And of course we couldn't whisper among each other, "Who was that?</span> <span id="s1091">What's going on?"</span> <span id="s1092">That was completely out.</span> <span id="s1093">And at first they didn't talk to us at all.</span> <span id="s1094">They just stood there in front of us and smoked and laughed and joked.</span> <span id="s1095">Very young, our age.</span> <span id="s1096">I was 20 at that point.</span> <span id="s1097">And then they called before them the heads of each of the Jewish departments – of each department, including Lustig who was head of the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">02:32:44 And then, then first of all, that guy introduced himself.</span> <span id="s1099">He was Brunner – Anton Brunner from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1100">And he had come from Vienna with those three Jews.</span> <span id="s1101">Then he told us why he was there, and in his own Viennese dialect, which is still ringing in my ears he said, and of course I'll say it in English, that he came to show the SS in Berlin how to deal with the Jews – how they had dealt with the Jews in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1102">And that's why he came and brought the three Jews with him.</span> <span id="s1103">How to deal with the Jews?</span> <span id="s1104">We thought they had been doing fine up to now.</span> <span id="s1105">But his innovation was – his fork in the road – was that from now on the Jews had to do the dirty work.</span> <span id="s1106">And he demonstrated it right away.</span> <span id="s1107">He told the leaders of each department to pick their own, to pick their own – 30 percent of each department to go into transport.</span> <span id="s1108">He wasn't gonna bother picking anymore.</span> <span id="s1109">He had each of the Jews pick their own Jews.</span> <span id="s1110">And that didn't sink in right away, but after it sank in it was really ein Wendepunkt– a turning point – a pivotal point in the history of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1111">From then on it was Jews stuffing Jews into the, into the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1112">It was Jews taking the Jews out of the cattle cars, too, and doing all the, all the agents of their own destruction they were from then on.</span> <span id="s1113">And under that falls the Kaposand the Jewish elders, and even we, we got white armbands.</span> <span id="s1114">We had to go</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">50 Rolf Günther 51 Alois (Anton) Brunner 52 Turning point, milestone (German) 53 Formen (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor squadron of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">around helping them and we had to do our own.</span> <span id="s1117">That was very diabolic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">02:34:43</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Can you explain what you mean – what it was that you had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Well we were sent home.</span> <span id="s1121">Somehow I wasn't picked to go into transport so I was sent back to the hospital, and a few weeks later we were sent again.</span> <span id="s1122">We were sent three times.</span> <span id="s1123">Yes, and then the second time – the first time he took hostages.</span> <span id="s1124">Brunner took hostages.</span> <span id="s1125">The first time he still let the people go home.</span> <span id="s1126">The people had to pick their own people to go into transport and he allowed them to go home – to pack and to say “goodbye.”</span> <span id="s1127">But he kept 20 of the high officials of the Jewish Community hostages.</span> <span id="s1128">And he said that if not everybody would show up, those 20 people would be killed.</span> <span id="s1129">At the time I still remembered their names and I think I wrote it into my, into my notes.</span> <span id="s1130">I could look it up.</span> <span id="s1131">But it’s not important at the moment.</span> <span id="s1132">And some actually did either kill themselves – some of the people who were supposed to go to transport either killed themselves or went underground, or just ran away.</span> <span id="s1133">And he actually did kill those 20 people.</span> <span id="s1134">He sent the ashes to their families.</span> <span id="s1135">So we knew he meant business.</span> <span id="s1136">And that was the same thing later in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1137">If something went wrong – 20, 200, 2,000 – were killed for one person.</span> <span id="s1138">So that's the reason why I didn't – why we didn't think of, of objecting, of doing anything against them.</span> <span id="s1139">We couldn't be responsible for the death of our own people.</span> <span id="s1140">But anyway, so then we were sent back, and the second time we were sent back, he called the head of the Jewish Community before him – that was Dr. Kraindl – and Kraindl was struck by a heart attack in front of these SS people and fell dead.</span> <span id="s1141">And he said, "Move him.</span> <span id="s1142">Go away.</span> <span id="s1143">Take away that dead person.</span> <span id="s1144">Just another dead Jew."</span> <span id="s1145">And then the third time we were told to go the Kasernen– to the barracks to help with the transportation of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">02:37:11 Now that was in February of ‘43 during the big Fabrikaktion.The Fabrikaktion was that they went into the – into those factories and took out the people who were working there who thought they were protected – who had been promised protection because they worked for the – for the military units.</span> <span id="s1147">And they came by the thousands.</span> <span id="s1148">They came in huge furniture vans stuffed with Jews, just they way they were from the factories – in their aprons – with their clothes – and always with the star of course.</span> <span id="s1149">And we had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1150">We had... One of my friends, her name was Klara, I remember it.</span> <span id="s1151">We were assigned to the Rathenower Kaserne in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1152">I had never been there.</span> <span id="s1153">We had to go there by special permit to use the public transportation.</span> <span id="s1154">And there was this huge barrack, and the Jews were not allowed to use the toilets.</span> <span id="s1155">That was the first thing.</span> <span id="s1156">No food of course – no toilets – nothing.</span> <span id="s1157">So then some Jewish people came who dug a ditch in the backyard.</span> <span id="s1158">That was the toilet.</span> <span id="s1159">And then finally some coffee came.</span> <span id="s1160">But in between that we already had some thousands of Jews who were</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">54 Barracks (German) 55 Factory action (German); factory round-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">beside themselves – direct from the factory – without their mothers or fathers or children or husbands, or anybody.</span> <span id="s1163">That was really pandemonium in that – in those barracks.</span> <span id="s1164">Then I remember we had to go out and take in all these people that came by the hundreds.</span> <span id="s1165">And I remember one van opened up and blood stained people fell out.</span> <span id="s1166">They had resisted and the SS shot them.</span> <span id="s1167">Big deal, you know.</span> <span id="s1168">And we weren't allowed to do anything to them – we just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">We had no material anyway.</span> <span id="s1170">So they were then shipped off too, the way they were – bleeding.</span> <span id="s1171">And then we were... We worked there for two days straight – for three days straight, and then finally we were released from duty and some other nurses came with their white armbands and we got back.</span> <span id="s1172">And then we went again the next three days.</span> <span id="s1173">It was three day shifts.</span> <span id="s1174">And then finally that Fabrikaktion was over ‘cause there were no more Jews to take.</span> <span id="s1175">That was in February, ‘43, and then a few weeks later I was finally taken too.</span> <span id="s1176">I had enough by then.</span> <span id="s1177">Now you can understand why I say it was a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">02:41:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: You mentioned that you were wearing white armbands – the nurses, the helpers were wearing white armbands.</span> <span id="s1180">And you mentioned that in some way, you even had to help with what the Nazis were doing in terms of getting people.</span> <span id="s1181">What did you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: What did I mean by that?</span> <span id="s1183">Well ordinarily they should have done that themselves.</span> <span id="s1184">Why should we – we Jews – do this?</span> <span id="s1185">That was terrible.</span> <span id="s1186">That was the worst of the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: No, I understand.</span> <span id="s1188">That I understand.</span> <span id="s1189">I mean, what in fact did you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: We had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1191">We had to put them onto straw mattresses.</span> <span id="s1192">We had to get the straw and put it around, and assign places to them.</span> <span id="s1193">They didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1194">Neither did we for that matter, but at least we were told to make some order in this huge barracks.</span> <span id="s1195">This was like a, like a military barrack.</span> <span id="s1196">It was a military barrack.</span> <span id="s1197">And we were in the big, big room, and we had to bring them in from the vans, and take them to a place, and say, "Now this is your place.</span> <span id="s1198">You stay here until we come back to you and tell you what to do."</span> <span id="s1199">They had nothing with them.</span> <span id="s1200">They came directly from work.</span> <span id="s1201">And we didn't know very much either, so we did the best we could.</span> <span id="s1202">We had no food to give them for a long while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">What happened was they, they begged us to see that their children would be taken care of, or their old mothers would be taken care of.</span> <span id="s1204">But how could we do that?</span> <span id="s1205">We couldn't leave the barracks either.</span> <span id="s1206">So they scribbled on little notepads where to go to.</span> <span id="s1207">But if the SS saw that they would shoot right away.</span> <span id="s1208">So we quickly stuck them into our pockets, and afterwards we drove around and tried to help as much as we could.</span> <span id="s1209">It was nothing that you can normally foresee.</span> <span id="s1210">This – these Fabrikaktion involved 20,000 people that were shipped out of Berlin during those three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: You said that Lustig, Dr. Lustig, at a certain point began choosing people who would actually go on the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1213">That was his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Now he was choosing inside the hospital, or– A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Just inside the hospital.</span> <span id="s1216">A: Inside the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: What did that mean for you as nurses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: That any day we could be called up.</span> <span id="s1219">That any day we would be on the list.</span> <span id="s1220">He got us on a certain quota, which we didn't know at the time.</span> <span id="s1221">We didn't realize that at all.</span> <span id="s1222">We knew somehow he was involved with the SS, but just how, how the connections worked, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1223">After we had heard Brunner say that the Jews had to pick their own Jews, then we knew.</span> <span id="s1224">Then it was no longer so secretive.</span> <span id="s1225">He got his orders to choose, let's say, 500 Jews for tomorrow morning at eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s1226">The trucks would come and 500 Jews had to be ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">So he just had to pick somebody.</span> <span id="s1228">They weren't voluntarily going.</span> <span id="s1229">So he probably had a quota of so many patients, and so many physicians, and so many nurses, and so many help – helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">02:43:52</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Did you, as the staff, have to help in getting people to these transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s1233">I didn't.</span> <span id="s1234">As a matter of fact, yes.</span> <span id="s1235">When I went into the Theresienstadt transport, then a lot of the kids from the children's station also went, and I simply was put in charge of those kids.</span> <span id="s1236">But at that point we didn't know it was a Theresienstadt transport.</span> <span id="s1237">We only realized that when we got to the Gerlach Strasse instead of to the Oranienburger Strasse.</span> <span id="s1238">See we knew we had to help in those places a number of times.</span> <span id="s1239">I never did, but some of the other nur– I was sent to Rathenower Kaserne, but many of my colleagues were sent to those collection centers, and so we knew where the trains were going to from the collection centers, and I ended up at Gerlach Strasse, and I knew that was Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1240">How come?</span> <span id="s1241">How come?</span> <span id="s1242">And then I met some of the Jewish Community personnel that I was very friendly with.</span> <span id="s1243">Their names were Simmon – Werner and Eva Simmon – very close friends – and they were there too.</span> <span id="s1244">The first emotion was one of happiness.</span> <span id="s1245">"Oh, thank God I know somebody.</span> <span id="s1246">I'm not in a sea of unknown people."</span> <span id="s1247">But of course the next emotion was, “Where are we going?”</span> <span id="s1248">And Werner Simmon who was an employee of the hospital – of the Jewish Community Center, said, "We're going to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1249">We're lucky" I didn't even ask how come.</span> <span id="s1250">Who cares?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Eva is the woman who had the– A: I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Eva is the woman who had the baby in the Hospital.</span> <span id="s1253">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: In the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: I became friendly with Werner and Eva Simmon because I delivered her baby.</span> <span id="s1256">And I just was very, very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s1257">I walked through their house many times skirting all the greenery, and when I saw them there, what a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">02:45:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Tell me, how many people were, do you think approximately – were working or living in this Jewish Community Complex where the hospital was?</span> <span id="s1260">Do you have any idea?</span> <span id="s1261">Was it a lot of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Do you think in the thousands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1265">I would say in the thousands.</span> <span id="s1266">It was a large, huge hospital – very many departments – very huge building for the dormitories for the nurses, and another huge building where the doctors had their little apartments.</span> <span id="s1267">And then there was Pathologie.That was a whole section in itself – a whole building – which was later, actually after I left I was told – that was later one of the collection centers too.</span> <span id="s1268">And then there was like a house for the SS where Döbberke lived, and a whole house for Wirtschaft,you know, where they cleaned and where the steam was generated, and where the laundry building was – really huge buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: And the Jewish Community leadership was there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: No.</span> <span id="s1271">That wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1272">That was on Oranienburger Strasse.</span> <span id="s1273">That was also a huge complex.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">That was under Rabbiner Baeck – Leo Baeck.</span> <span id="s1275">No, not always.</span> <span id="s1276">That was first under – I think it was under Kotzover.I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1277">I wasn't that familiar with the Jewish Community.</span> <span id="s1278">But we always knew of and about Rabbiner Baeck, who was also a controversial figure.</span> <span id="s1279">How much did he help the Nazis?</span> <span id="s1280">How much did he know?</span> <span id="s1281">How, if at all, did he protect the Jews?</span> <span id="s1282">Those are questions that still bother me a great deal.</span> <span id="s1283">Did they know, and if they knew what could they have done?</span> <span id="s1284">What would they have done?</span> <span id="s1285">They couldn't all like, like Czerniakowin Warsaw, kill themselves to end this all.</span> <span id="s1286">And he only did it because his wife</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">56 Pathology (German) 57 Trade and industry (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">58 Philip Kotzover</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">59 Adam Czerniakow was taken hostage.</span> <span id="s1290">It wasn't simple.</span> <span id="s1291">It was not a white and black situation.</span> <span id="s1292">It wasn't a simple situation.</span> <span id="s1293">These people had to do the Nazis' bidding.</span> <span id="s1294">They had no way out in many cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Their own families were taken hostages.</span> <span id="s1296">And in many cases they thought they were helping the Jews.</span> <span id="s1297">In many cases they thought they would deal much more kindly with the Jews than the Nazis would, and they could ease our suffering in some ways.</span> <span id="s1298">But those are all questions that I want to research now and see if I can find any answers.</span> <span id="s1299">But really there was no way out.</span> <span id="s1300">There was just no way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">02:49:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Do you think you would have wanted someone to tell you what was really going on if they knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: You know we heard the word “vergasung.”</span> <span id="s1304">I remember that so clearly.</span> <span id="s1305">I almost remember the place where I sat and the person who told it to me.</span> <span id="s1306">"Die werden alle vergast," said someone to me.</span> <span id="s1307">You know it went in one ear and out the other.</span> <span id="s1308">What is Vergasung?How do you picture human beings being vergast?Didn't mean a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Do you think if Leo Baeck had told you – not just this rumor, but a leader would have said something, would that have mattered, or would it have meant nothing because–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: That's a big question.</span> <span id="s1311">That's a very big question.</span> <span id="s1312">That's the very, very big question.</span> <span id="s1313">If people asked him what to do he told them to go.</span> <span id="s1314">Should he have?</span> <span id="s1315">Should he not have?</span> <span id="s1316">I don't know the answer.</span> <span id="s1317">I don't know the answer.</span> <span id="s1318">We ourselves could have refused to help in those Kaserne.</span> <span id="s1319">Maybe we did the wrong thing too.</span> <span id="s1320">It didn't occur to us not to obey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Did anybody refuse to help that you know of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Nobody refused to help.</span> <span id="s1323">It didn't occur to us.</span> <span id="s1324">We were so conditioned to obey, and I think... I almost think that's how Hitler got so powerful, because the Germans too were so conditioned to obey.</span> <span id="s1325">They always obeyed one voice – the Kaiser for years, for centuries, for thousands of years.</span> <span id="s1326">They were always told what to do, so Hitler came and he told them what to do, so they obeyed.</span> <span id="s1327">And we were no different.</span> <span id="s1328">We were, we were Germans too.</span> <span id="s1329">We were also conditioned to obey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Was that typical in a German family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Yes, very typical – very, very typical.</span> <span id="s1332">It was not a democracy.</span> <span id="s1333">And Jewishly it was also very typical.</span> <span id="s1334">You always obeyed.</span> <span id="s1335">You always... And historically it was typical.</span> <span id="s1336">The Jews were</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">60 Gassing (German) 61 They will all be gassed.</span> <span id="s1338">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">62 Gassing (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">63 Gassed (German) persecuted before, but by laying low and by obeying – sure some were killed and some were strung up and burned and mutilated, but the Jewish Community kept them going.</span> <span id="s1341">It wasn't the whole thing, but they were always conditioned to obey.</span> <span id="s1342">And so you paid a little money, and you, you did something to let the cloud go over, and it always did.</span> <span id="s1343">This was the first time it didn't work.</span> <span id="s1344">We didn't know how to object – not as Germans and not as Jews, truly.</span> <span id="s1345">And I really think that was part of the problem.</span> <span id="s1346">And if people ask me if it can happen here I say, "No."</span> <span id="s1347">The people here are conditioned to question, and conditioned to – they have an inborn common sense and they're always conditioned by hundreds of years of democracy to stand up for what they think is right.</span> <span id="s1348">And I really don't think it could happen here.</span> <span id="s1349">But it sure was happening there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">02:52:36</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Was your friend Golly – is it Golly?</span> <span id="s1352">Was she transported out before you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: We went on the same transport, even though she was a Mischlinge.</span> <span id="s1354">She volunteered.</span> <span id="s1355">She was friendly with one of the doctors and she followed him.</span> <span id="s1356">She married him in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1357">She's wonderful – very unusual person.</span> <span id="s1358">She volunteered.</span> <span id="s1359">She didn't have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: What did you think of that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: I loved her before and I loved her afterwards.</span> <span id="s1362">She was just a very wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1363">And then we went together, but then she – before she married him we roomed together, too.</span> <span id="s1364">And then she married that guy and she went.</span> <span id="s1365">In Theresienstadt you could live with your husband somehow if you managed it well.</span> <span id="s1366">And then I picked up a new friend, very soon.</span> <span id="s1367">I picked up Eva, as you know from my book.</span> <span id="s1368">I was always very lucky with friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: When you went on a transport, you had to take care of these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: We did, but there wasn't much to take care of.</span> <span id="s1371">We had nothing to do – to give them.</span> <span id="s1372">We had no food to give them.</span> <span id="s1373">We had no medical equipment.</span> <span id="s1374">We were not transported on a – in a cattle car.</span> <span id="s1375">We were actually in a regular car – in a regular train with seats and all.</span> <span id="s1376">So we just made sure that the kids all sat quietly and didn't cry.</span> <span id="s1377">There was very little to do.</span> <span id="s1378">And when we got to Theresienstadt, I still walked with them into the Ghetto, but then they were picked up and taken to the Children's Home and we were separated into – to the barracks there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">02:54:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: How many kids were there on that transport with you?</span> <span id="s1381">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: I don't recall that.</span> <span id="s1383">I actually had so little to do with them.</span> <span id="s1384">Perhaps 30 – I'm gonna say 30 kids.</span> <span id="s1385">Q: And these were the kids who had been hospitalized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: Yes, those were the patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Were they orphans, or not necessarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: We only knew them as patients.</span> <span id="s1389">It could well be that in many cases the people went underground.</span> <span id="s1390">Many people left their children.</span> <span id="s1391">Many people went underground and hoped their kids would get by as orphans of Germans, you see.</span> <span id="s1392">Then they could be picked up into German – into the German sector and could be saved.</span> <span id="s1393">And it may have been some of that.</span> <span id="s1394">And then I don't remember much about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Was it a difficult journey on this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: No, I felt good about the journey.</span> <span id="s1397">Remember, I was still thinking I would see my mother and my sister, and everybody.</span> <span id="s1398">I had so many uncles and aunts, and.</span> <span id="s1399">… My grandmother had died and my Aunt Adelheid had died, so – in Germany still.</span> <span id="s1400">They were buried in Germany.</span> <span id="s1401">But uncles and aunts, and all the friends that had gone before.</span> <span id="s1402">And also remember, I was with Eva and Werner and their child.</span> <span id="s1403">It may not sound like much, but you sucked out every little bit of enjoyment, you know.</span> <span id="s1404">That was enjoyment.</span> <span id="s1405">Enjoyment was measured in decimals – not in going to the Opera.</span> <span id="s1406">No, this was fun.</span> <span id="s1407">I was going to be together with Eva and Werner for a few hours – a few days.</span> <span id="s1408">And I don't remember too much otherwise about the journey, just that we got there and we had to walk then from Bauschewitz to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1409">And then the children were already taken care of.</span> <span id="s1410">Somebody took the whole group of children, and we were on our own.</span> <span id="s1411">Then we turned and helped the older people.</span> <span id="s1412">Don't forget there were also old patients out of the hospital, and people who couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1413">And then Eva and I helped the older people.</span> <span id="s1414">And she had her little boy with her anyway who was – see he was born in ‘41.</span> <span id="s1415">He was two years old.</span> <span id="s1416">He was a little kid.</span> <span id="s1417">And then I remember getting into Theresienstadt, and it looked all very, very foreign – very different.</span> <span id="s1418">It was a fortress.</span> <span id="s1419">It was a, it was a medieval fortress – an enclosure with a moat, and you had go over a bridge to get in, and you didn't see very much because there were these high walls.</span> <span id="s1420">All I could see was the church steeple.</span> <span id="s1421">And around, there was this huge walls.</span> <span id="s1422">And once we were inside we could tell that along the walls, all around the ghetto in an octagon, were these barracks – these huge stone buildings, two stories high – and they were again closed up toward the street, you see.</span> <span id="s1423">You had to go into the barracks just like you had to go into Theresienstadt to see what was inside.</span> <span id="s1424">You had to again go into the barracks, and then you ended up like in a huge courtyard, and around you again was barracks.</span> <span id="s1425">Can you follow this?</span> <span id="s1426">And you could – perhaps I can, I can compare it to a monastery where you can walk all around and you still, you're still inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">You're still – always facing that huge exercise grounds.</span> <span id="s1428">It was a military barracks where the people had to do their military exercises, you see, and you could almost watch that from every point.</span> <span id="s1429">And we were sent into the upstairs rooms, and we were laid on straws.</span> <span id="s1430">That was all we had.</span> <span id="s1431">And that was our Ubikationit was called – unsere Wohnung– our residence 64 Rooming space (German) 65 Our domicile (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">for the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">02:59:05 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">03:01:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Mrs. Haas, I want to go back so that you can help us understand something.</span> <span id="s1437">When you were at the Kaserne with helping with Klara, helping the people.</span> <span id="s1438">They gave you little notes and you at some risk, you and Klara, went around giving these notes to parents, children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: They mostly gave us their addresses ‘cause they had kids at home, or old parents at home.</span> <span id="s1440">They were taken without any notice and they were panicked.</span> <span id="s1441">They didn't know what their kids were doing.</span> <span id="s1442">So we took those notes, and after we were through, we couldn't follow up all of them.</span> <span id="s1443">There were thousands of people.</span> <span id="s1444">But the few that we did, we took the children with us to the children's station at the hospital, ‘cause they were totally alone.</span> <span id="s1445">In some cases, they were, you know, little youngsters – three, four, five, six years old – and we took them with us.</span> <span id="s1446">And those were then the children that went on to the next transport.</span> <span id="s1447">They were free game.</span> <span id="s1448">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: And these were the children– A: These were the transport–</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: that you – that you were on the transport with?</span> <span id="s1451">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1453">You were describing this moat and this fortress like structure at Theresienstadt when you arrived.</span> <span id="s1454">Now before you actually began to walk around and go wherever you had to go, there was somebody you met when you first got off the train – some young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Yes, the helpers that were suppose to help us.</span> <span id="s1456">And he told us a little about Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">What did we know about Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s1458">Not a thing.</span> <span id="s1459">We only knew the name.</span> <span id="s1460">And he told us a little bit about the history and what to expect.</span> <span id="s1461">Like, for instance, he told us about the Schleusse.What on earth was the Schleusse?</span> <span id="s1462">Nobody ever – you see, there was a whole new vocabulary that grew up as I have mentioned before, and Schleusse was one of the words that we never heard of.</span> <span id="s1463">It was where they took everything away from us.</span> <span id="s1464">What does Schleusse mean literally?</span> <span id="s1465">It means a control point where you had to go through, like a toll point where you were told in which barrack you were going to live.</span> <span id="s1466">You were given your number.</span> <span id="s1467">Everybody had a number, and if somebody asks us….</span> <span id="s1468">You see, any of the SS that saw us in the camp could at any time ask us to identify ourselves.</span> <span id="s1469">He didn't want to know our name.</span> <span id="s1470">He didn't want to know I was Gerda Schild.</span> <span id="s1471">He wanted to know my ghetto number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">What was it?</span> <span id="s1473">“Q” – I have it somewheres – “Q l,000” or 11, 12 something.</span> <span id="s1474">That's what we had to memorize.</span> <span id="s1475">And that was given to us in the Schleusse, and at the same time we were</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">66 Sluice (German) relived of most of our possessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">03:04:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Did you have to wear this number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: No.</span> <span id="s1480">We didn't wear that number.</span> <span id="s1481">We just had to know it at all times.</span> <span id="s1482">It was on a little slip of paper that we kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: And this person's name who was explaining...</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Pavel, Paul – Pavel.</span> <span id="s1485">I lost him after that.</span> <span id="s1486">He was just one of the Czech youngsters who came and talked with me.</span> <span id="s1487">Of course they were all very glad to have – to get out of the ghetto and have someone to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Now when he first met you, you heard him say something like, "Did you have any contrabands?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: What was he referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Well contraband – another new expression – was for us anything they didn't allow for Jews to possess – lipstick, money, cigarettes, chocolate, even female napkins – anything like that was called contraband.</span> <span id="s1492">As a matter of fact, anything that belonged to a Jew was not allowed to belong to him, so most everything was contraband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: And did he want some of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: No.</span> <span id="s1495">No, no.</span> <span id="s1496">He was a nice honest guy – just a nice guy, he was really helping me.</span> <span id="s1497">No, the Jews were alright.</span> <span id="s1498">We didn't have any problems with the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Were you treated brutally when you first arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: No, I was not.</span> <span id="s1501">No, thank God, I was never hit or beaten or molested in any way.</span> <span id="s1502">We always expected it and we were always on guard, but I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: So how long were you waiting with this guy Pavel in this grouping to take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Well, the walk from Bauschewitz to Theresienstadt was maybe a good half hour, so he hung around me.</span> <span id="s1505">He was probably a little attracted to me.</span> <span id="s1506">I was still young.</span> <span id="s1507">I was nice looking.</span> <span id="s1508">I was not starving or I was not skeletal or anything.</span> <span id="s1509">And I wouldn't be surprised that he was hoping to see me again later, but it was not the case.</span> <span id="s1510">It was very casual.</span> <span id="s1511">And then it took several hours.</span> <span id="s1512">Then we had to sit on our knapsacks for a while in the barrack grounds until that whole transport was absorbed and registered in and that took awhile.</span> <span id="s1513">And then toward evening we got into the barracks.</span> <span id="s1514">But somehow I don't think I ever saw him again afterwards.</span> <span id="s1515">There was thousands of people, how could I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">03:06:43</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Did you have your own clothes?</span> <span id="s1518">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1519">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: They didn't take away your–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: No.</span> <span id="s1522">We kept our own clothes.</span> <span id="s1523">They took away a lot, but we could keep some.</span> <span id="s1524">Q: And what was the barracks like when you–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: The barracks were military barracks, huge rooms, straw for each person.</span> <span id="s1526">That's how everybody first was checked in.</span> <span id="s1527">And then we had to go into Hundertschaft.Literally translated that means detail of a hundred.</span> <span id="s1528">And it was always a hundred people that worked at a certain task.</span> <span id="s1529">I was in the Hundertschaft of cleaning – sweeping the streets at first.</span> <span id="s1530">You didn't get there to relax or anything.</span> <span id="s1531">You were checked in, get into your straw, put your things down and off to work, you see.</span> <span id="s1532">And so I swept the streets for a long time – not for too long.</span> <span id="s1533">Then it occurred to me, and you know somebody told me all this.</span> <span id="s1534">You weren't wise, ghetto wise right of quick.</span> <span id="s1535">So somebody told me, "Why don't you try to get into the health system and become a nurse again."</span> <span id="s1536">And of course that sounded like a super idea.</span> <span id="s1537">And I applied to the Jewish self-government.</span> <span id="s1538">The ghetto was completely self-governed, but again, just like in Lustig's case, they were complete puppets of the SS And so I applied to get into the nursing phase of the ghetto, and I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1539">I still have my, my little notice that I could be a nurse and wear a nurse's uniform.</span> <span id="s1540">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1541">And with that came a little better food also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: Is this when you met your friend–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: And then, yes, we were – then I could move out of those barracks.</span> <span id="s1544">That was already a huge improvement.</span> <span id="s1545">I was so sick of those barracks, with all these women, and there was a hostile feeling there because everybody was so – was so humiliated, and was so sad, and there was no spirit there at all.</span> <span id="s1546">So I was already very happy to get out of that situation.</span> <span id="s1547">And then I was detailed to the, to the home for children on Bergstrasse.</span> <span id="s1548">And in that basement we, the nurses, could make a little nest for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1549">The basement rooms themselves were, of course, you know very, very poor, very stark.</span> <span id="s1550">And we had a couple of these bunkbeds – not a couple, two on each lining the wall.</span> <span id="s1551">There were many people.</span> <span id="s1552">And I, by sheer luck, ended up sharing my bunk with a nurse from Vienna – Eva, Eva Atlas.</span> <span id="s1553">And apparently I attract light hearted 67 Group of 100 (German) people because I, myself, I'm on the serious side.</span> <span id="s1554">So Eva was a very lighthearted, nice, round-faced nurse from Vienna, and we liked each other right away.</span> <span id="s1555">And somehow everything is easier to bear when you have a friend.</span> <span id="s1556">I think a lot of us who survived, survived because we had a good friend to share things with.</span> <span id="s1557">At first, when things were very hard, Eva and I made sure that we always had a little bread.</span> <span id="s1558">If she was out of bread, I shared mine with her.</span> <span id="s1559">If I didn't have any more to eat, naturally it was the other way around.</span> <span id="s1560">So that already helped.</span> <span id="s1561">And then as our rations – as we worked harder and harder, the rations became better and better.</span> <span id="s1562">We had what was called S-Rationen.</span> <span id="s1563">And at the moment I don't remember what the “S” stood for.</span> <span id="s1564">Maybe for “speziell” – “special rations” or something.</span> <span id="s1565">But it meant a little more bread and a little more soup, and extra coffee.</span> <span id="s1566">And then things were not so bad anymore.</span> <span id="s1567">And then we both had friends and admirers.</span> <span id="s1568">And I had Jirca who worked in the bakery, and he made tiny little Gs for my first name in bread then, ‘cause I shared that with Eva too.</span> <span id="s1569">And then things got much better.</span> <span id="s1570">And, again, we were in a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s1571">We were completely alone – Eva as well as myself.</span> <span id="s1572">We had no hope for a future.</span> <span id="s1573">We were so worried about daily calls to the Auschwitz transports.</span> <span id="s1574">That was the big, big Sword of Damocles that was always hanging over.</span> <span id="s1575">And yet we were young.</span> <span id="s1576">We were 20, 21 years old.</span> <span id="s1577">We weren't too badly off.</span> <span id="s1578">We had a bed to sleep in.</span> <span id="s1579">We had some food.</span> <span id="s1580">We had some admirers.</span> <span id="s1581">What more do you want at 21?</span> <span id="s1582">So we kind of sailed along, and we did our work.</span> <span id="s1583">I went a lot, by the way, to that, to that old age home that was right across the street from the nurse's – from the children's home.</span> <span id="s1584">Because I had discovered that Frau Frankel, with whom my mother shared an – who took my mother in, in Munich – and I was able to help her out in turn a little bit with my little “G-rations” of bread.</span> <span id="s1585">And that was good, that was good.</span> <span id="s1586">And I met other old people there.</span> <span id="s1587">The old people were hopeless.</span> <span id="s1588">They had nothing to live for.</span> <span id="s1589">And they didn't work, so they had very poor rations.</span> <span id="s1590">So Eva and I did what we could over there after work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">03:12:31</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Did the old people live separate from...?</span> <span id="s1593">How were the barracks divided, or how were the living situations divided?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: At first everybody had to go into the barracks and lie on the floor on straw.</span> <span id="s1595">And then the old people went into the old aged home which was miserable, miserable.</span> <span id="s1596">The barracks were better than that.</span> <span id="s1597">Dark and dirty and just hopeless, smelly.</span> <span id="s1598">And that was a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s1599">And the young people were taken to appropriate works.</span> <span id="s1600">You see the ghetto was completely organized and taken care of by Jews.</span> <span id="s1601">There was ghetto Jewish police and Jewish firemen, and we took care of the kids, and, of course, Jewish nurses and doctors, and Jewish street- sweepers and the whole works.</span> <span id="s1602">And the Judenältester– Eppsteinand Edelsteinand</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">68 S-Rations (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">69 Special (German) 70 Jewish elder (German); term used for Nazi appointed Jewish community leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">71 Paul Eppstein</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">72 Jakob Edelstein Murmelstein– three stones.</span> <span id="s1607">Does that explain it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Three stones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Well, all their names ended with “stein,” which is in German a stone.</span> <span id="s1610">But that was coincidental.</span> <span id="s1611">We knew Eppstein from Berlin, and it was best during his administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Edelstein or Eppstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Edelstein – I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1614">Edelstein from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: When you say that Eva Atlas was lighthearted, what did that mean?</span> <span id="s1616">Did she, she laughed easily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1618">She wasn't worried the way I was.</span> <span id="s1619">She wasn't constantly ruminating in pessimism.</span> <span id="s1620">She lived for the moment.</span> <span id="s1621">She had enough bread right now and she had her work, and she had me, and we could go out before the curfew.</span> <span id="s1622">We stopped work at seven and the curfew was at eight, so we always went out a little bit.</span> <span id="s1623">And then, I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1624">By 1943 we had to do what was called “Ghetto verschönerung” – the beautification of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1625">So we got involved in that.</span> <span id="s1626">And why was there all of a sudden this emphasis on having the ghetto beautiful and representative?</span> <span id="s1627">As you know, there come – the International Commission came that following summer.</span> <span id="s1628">But before the International Commission came, a German pre-commission already came.</span> <span id="s1629">So the whole ghetto suddenly was buoyed.</span> <span id="s1630">We were suddenly involved in sowing grass and planting flowers – and painting the houses and sewing curtains to put into only the downstairs where this commission could walk by.</span> <span id="s1631">So we suddenly, in our little basement room, we had a little curtain.</span> <span id="s1632">And then there was cultural beautification as well.</span> <span id="s1633">Suddenly the SS allowed, and not only allowed, but ordered the Jews to sing and dance, so to say, as their little puppets on a string.</span> <span id="s1634">But we didn't look behind that.</span> <span id="s1635">We just knew we could sing again, and walk around, and look at the flowers – and that's what we did.</span> <span id="s1636">And Eva, who had a very nice voice, was taken into the choir, and so she had a pass past the curfew to rehearse in the choir and I always went with her.</span> <span id="s1637">And so she rehearsed the Elijah another, another phenomenon of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1638">The Elijah is an oratorium which, first of all was written by a Jew – Mendelssohn– secondly, the context is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1639">It speaks of that glorification of God, who is – who punishes the wicked, you see – who doesn't give fire to the sacrifice of the Baalites, and he punishes them in the end, and they have to go and disappear – and elaborates and honors, and rewards the Jews – Elijah and the Jews.</span> <span id="s1640">How they ever allowed this in the ghetto, I will never know, but I didn't ask any questions.</span> <span id="s1641">I went and heard Eva sing in the choir, and the melodies are still very much with me.</span> <span id="s1642">So that was Eva.</span> <span id="s1643">She took what came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">73 Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein 74 Stone, rock (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">75 Embellishment (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">76 Felix Mendelssohn</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">03:17:19</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Now you and Jirca would go and listen to the rehearsals I gather, and then walked back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yes, we went to rehearsals.</span> <span id="s1650">And then we also went to when she really sang.</span> <span id="s1651">It was performed – the rehearsals were before the Commission, and then it was performed during the Commission, along with a lot of other things.</span> <span id="s1652">And we took part in all of it.</span> <span id="s1653">I saw Tosca, and I saw Carmen.</span> <span id="s1654">And you must understand that I saw and heard this with the most magnificent voices there was.</span> <span id="s1655">The Jewish – the top – the cream of the Jewish voices had come to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1656">The best of the Jewish musicians – of directors and conductors and everything.</span> <span id="s1657">And we heard that.</span> <span id="s1658">Of course it wasn't elaborate.</span> <span id="s1659">It was in some attic room in that ghetto close.</span> <span id="s1660">But the voices!</span> <span id="s1661">I still can't take a mediocre voice because in my youth I heard these magnificent sounds, and that stayed with me.</span> <span id="s1662">And those people, after they were done singing, went behind the (Inaudible) to the transports.</span> <span id="s1663">That was the bad thing.</span> <span id="s1664">But we didn't worry about it so much anymore then.</span> <span id="s1665">We just lived for the moment.</span> <span id="s1666">We just lived for that evening when we could go and hear that and enter a new world – a world of sound, and music, and voices – the human voice.</span> <span id="s1667">That was nice.</span> <span id="s1668">So we enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s1669">And very soon Jirca went on transport too, and Eva and I stayed.</span> <span id="s1670">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1671">Miracle, just a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">03:19:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: There were orchestras and chamber music as well, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1675">Yes.</span> <span id="s1676">They had confiscated a lot of the musical instruments from Prague, and if they missed anything they went to Prague and took it – the SS And then the Jews were ordered to rehearse a certain piece Smetana’s, Bartered Bride.</span> <span id="s1677">Ah, heaven!</span> <span id="s1678">And a lot of Smetanaand a lot of Dvořak– The New World Symphony.</span> <span id="s1679">They were sitting on a stage, on a podium, in the middle of the square, in the middle of the ghetto, in the middle of Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s1680">It was absurd.</span> <span id="s1681">It was bizarre.</span> <span id="s1682">And if we had thought about it, we would have gone mad.</span> <span id="s1683">But we didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s1684">We just walked by, arm-in-arm, and listened to that heavenly music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Not even knowing that after the concert these people would all be shipped out – or after the Commission left.</span> <span id="s1686">Even before the Commission left, because the ghetto was overcrowded – hugely overcrowded.</span> <span id="s1687">The ghetto always remained at 50,000, but it wasn't the same 50,000.</span> <span id="s1688">It was a constant new transport coming in and thousands and thousands of people being shipped out.</span> <span id="s1689">So we were just lucky.</span> <span id="s1690">We were never called to go into transport.</span> <span id="s1691">And during the pre-commission, the ghetto was overcrowded.</span> <span id="s1692">There were probably 60,000 or 70,000, and they couldn't show the Commission an overcrowded ghetto, so they shipped out tens of thousands of people before the Commission came.</span> <span id="s1693">And Jirca was in one of those transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">77 Bedrich Smetana</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">78 Antonin Dvořak</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1698">I think so, because Eva and I went alone to hear all these operas.</span> <span id="s1699">Yes, I'm quite sure he was shipped out before.</span> <span id="s1700">And then the Commission came, and then after that they filmed all this, and after that there was no more music.</span> <span id="s1701">Then everybody was transported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">03:21:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: So this culture stops after the Red Cross Commission comes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: It went on a little bit more, but the enthusiasm and the purpose was gone.</span> <span id="s1705">Q: Were you filmed when that film was being made of that–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: I'm not sure I was in the film, but the film was done.</span> <span id="s1707">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1708">I was part of the deception while the Commission was there.</span> <span id="s1709">I don't remember what Eva did.</span> <span id="s1710">She may have been with me.</span> <span id="s1711">I don't recall that, but I recall that I was detailed behind a hay wagon, and I was told to put a little kerchief around my hair, and I got the rake over my shoulder.</span> <span id="s1712">And behind that filled up hay wagon, which we'd never seen before, we were walking – a group of us girls were walking and we had to sing.</span> <span id="s1713">I'm sure Eva was with me, too, because she had such a nice voice.</span> <span id="s1714">And we walked by the Commission, out of the ghetto, and in by the next gate, and then we were dissolved again ‘cause the Commission had passed.</span> <span id="s1715">It was all – all just a show.</span> <span id="s1716">But we didn't know, and we didn't care.</span> <span id="s1717">If we had any character, we would have refused to do that.</span> <span id="s1718">It didn't occur to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Now in your book you say that some people did refuse and they put them in a room for a few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1721">Yes, some people did refuse, especially the Danes the Danish Jews.</span> <span id="s1722">They had a lot more spirit than we did.</span> <span id="s1723">They were very different from us.</span> <span id="s1724">And also, you see, we already had ten years of Hitler and most of them didn't.</span> <span id="s1725">They were still fresh from their King, and from the authority of their King who was standing behind the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Can you repeat what you were saying about the Danes?</span> <span id="s1727">You said the Danes were different than you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s1729">The Danes were different.</span> <span id="s1730">First of all they, they were treated differently.</span> <span id="s1731">They lived in houses and they didn't have – I don't think they had to work.</span> <span id="s1732">I'm not sure on that now.</span> <span id="s1733">And I had one Danish girlfriend – one girl, Danish friend.</span> <span id="s1734">I don't know how I got her, but somehow I was friendly with one of them.</span> <span id="s1735">And she was very outspoken.</span> <span id="s1736">And she said that she would tell the Commission that this was all just a farce, a comedy, a Potemkin Village.</span> <span id="s1737">And she was taken into custody during the time of the International Commission.</span> <span id="s1738">And when she came out again, she told us she was together with a lot of other people who were outspoken, and with a lot of people who looked very Jewish.</span> <span id="s1739">And the explanation was later that they were taken into this custody not by the SS, but by the Jewish ghetto governments because they were afraid of any repercussions.</span> <span id="s1740">And if anything had gone on the whole ghetto would have been severely punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">03:24:43</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: What did you think of her actions at that time when she said that she was going to tell them the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: I admired her.</span> <span id="s1744">I didn't have the guts to do that.</span> <span id="s1745">It didn't even occur to me to do that.</span> <span id="s1746">You were told to do something and you did it.</span> <span id="s1747">It was such a, it was such a different mentality.</span> <span id="s1748">I don't even understand it myself anymore today.</span> <span id="s1749">But it really didn't occur to any of us to do that.</span> <span id="s1750">I wished I could, I wished I could have a simple, clean explanation for it, but I don't.</span> <span id="s1751">It was the whole business of – It all dragged after me – that whole 10 years of Hitler, and even before.</span> <span id="s1752">My whole 2,000 year history, that was all in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Could you explain your characterization of the barracks when you were in there with all these women, and you said there was – there was hostility – in the barracks?</span> <span id="s1754">Could you explain more of–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Yes, I'll try.</span> <span id="s1756">I wasn't in the barracks for too long.</span> <span id="s1757">I would think there was a very bad feeling, already on my part.</span> <span id="s1758">I had come to Theresienstadt actually with great expectations.</span> <span id="s1759">Right away I was disappointed.</span> <span id="s1760">Where's my mother?</span> <span id="s1761">Not here.</span> <span id="s1762">My sister?</span> <span id="s1763">Never heard of her.</span> <span id="s1764">All my friends?</span> <span id="s1765">Zero.</span> <span id="s1766">So already my mood was very down.</span> <span id="s1767">Then I get stuck into – I get separated from Eva Simmon – from my friend, from all the kids, from all the people I knew, from Golly also.</span> <span id="s1768">Golly was with me for a while, but we weren't together in – on the straw at all.</span> <span id="s1769">She was somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1770">And then these women, these were all older women whom I've never seen before.</span> <span id="s1771">And they were wrapped in their grief – in their separation from their families.</span> <span id="s1772">It just was no camaraderie there whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1773">And I felt lonely, and maybe the hostility came from me, but I could not form a friendship on that straw there at all.</span> <span id="s1774">And, I repeat, it's very important, in a situation that we were in, to have a friend – to have someone to share things with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">03:27:12</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Was your friendship with Eva typical or deeper than what you saw around you?</span> <span id="s1777">Or was it common that people had very close ties with one person or two persons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: That's a question I never asked myself.</span> <span id="s1779">But as I think back, I would say it was not unusual to form a very close friendship.</span> <span id="s1780">What else did we have?</span> <span id="s1781">That was all that was allowed to us – a personal friendship.</span> <span id="s1782">And I would say it was not too uncommon.</span> <span id="s1783">I could observe it looking back now.</span> <span id="s1784">In that room where we then lived, in that basement, and where we worked upstairs with the children, most of the other inhabitants were Czech nurses, Czech girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Because we were, after all in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1786">And, looking back, they were very tightly close together.</span> <span id="s1787">And there was a bit of a gulf between them and us.</span> <span id="s1788">They considered themselves in their own country, and we were the newcomers.</span> <span id="s1789">So we didn't form friendships with them at all.</span> <span id="s1790">But they formed friendships with themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: When you think back, do you think that women had different sorts of friendships than men, or there's not a gender difference here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s1793">I'm sure there were male-female friendships as well.</span> <span id="s1794">First of all, as I mentioned before, marriages were permitted, and my friend Golly very soon married the man that she had followed, and then lived with him in a small little room somewheres – even just in a corner of a small room.</span> <span id="s1795">It was not a luxurious way of living.</span> <span id="s1796">So there was male- female relationships throughout the ghetto, and I would think, yes, there were friendships either way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">03:29:17</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1799">I would have asked you that question, but I was also asking a question about male friendships with other men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1801">I wasn't aware of that.</span> <span id="s1802">No.</span> <span id="s1803">I was not aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: So you were separated from – the men were living separately from the women, except for those people who were–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1806">Yes, that's correct.</span> <span id="s1807">Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s1808">No, I was not afraid of – I was not aware of same sex friendships.</span> <span id="s1809">You know that was very, very taboo.</span> <span id="s1810">Number one in the Jewish Religion, and number one in Germany.</span> <span id="s1811">Hitler killed homosexuals.</span> <span id="s1812">The list of hate was Jews, homosexuals, blacks and then everybody else.</span> <span id="s1813">But that was not allowed.</span> <span id="s1814">Ah, forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: No, I actually wasn't referring to sexual relations now.</span> <span id="s1816">I really meant the friendships that were like the friendship you had with Eva, because you're talking about a relationship that helped you to survive, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: And I was wondering whether you saw, among men, a similar kind of pairing of, you know.</span> <span id="s1819">And were the pairings among men and women that weren't marriage, for instance, that were love affairs, were they always love affairs, or was that because the men had access to things that the women needed?</span> <span id="s1820">In other words, were they not always just straight forward not that love is straight forward?</span> <span id="s1821">Do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: I don't quite see what you're asking me.</span> <span id="s1823">Are you asking me if the kind of friendship I had with Eva, I could also observe between two men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: That's one question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1826">I'm wondering if I'm at all able to answer that because I had no insight into where the men lived, but I would think “yes.”</span> <span id="s1827">I would think they formed very close camaraderie as well.</span> <span id="s1828">How else could they survive?</span> <span id="s1829">So I would think the question of that must be “yes,” but I wouldn't know from any personal experience.</span> <span id="s1830">Now what was the other part of the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Well, I'll ask it in a balder – in a balder way.</span> <span id="s1832">Was there prostitution in Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s1833">03:31:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: That's a good question, and I have often been asked that.</span> <span id="s1835">I did not observe it while I was there, but since then I have read a lot about it.</span> <span id="s1836">But I don't think that there was because the Nazis were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the Jews – strictly.</span> <span id="s1837">And if anything like that occurred, it wasn't only the Jew that was punished, the Nazi was punished as well.</span> <span id="s1838">But I have since then heard so much of that, that I'm wondering if I was just not aware of it.</span> <span id="s1839">But I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1840">It certainly wasn't so that I could observe it.</span> <span id="s1841">The Nazis and Jews were strictly separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: How about among Jews?</span> <span id="s1843">A: How about what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Among Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: Sex among Jews?</span> <span id="s1846">I would think “yes.”</span> <span id="s1847">I would think that went on.</span> <span id="s1848">We were not in a situation like Auschwitz, and also we were healthier.</span> <span id="s1849">And fairly – there were babies born in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1850">So that – so my answer is “yes.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Did they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1853">They came to us to the home.</span> <span id="s1854">We took care of them, with their mothers.</span> <span id="s1855">The mothers nursed and the fathers came to visit, so I would say “yes.”</span> <span id="s1856">There was a normal life there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: Do you think these were pregnancies that occurred prior to arrival in Theresienstadt, or were people well enough you think...</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Both.</span> <span id="s1859">Both.</span> <span id="s1860">Many came pregnant from their homes – from their original homes – very many, and I would think.</span> <span id="s1861">… Also, officially, pregnancies had to be terminated, and were in the whole Elbe Hospital.</span> <span id="s1862">But yes, I think we had some babies there that were....</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: So there were abortions that were forced?</span> <span id="s1864">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1865">That was... They were ordered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: And the Judenrat carried that out.</span> <span id="s1867">There was no... A: No.</span> <span id="s1868">There was no question – no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Did you ever have to participate in any of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: No.</span> <span id="s1871">I was not in that part of the health system.</span> <span id="s1872">I was with the product – with the nurses with the babies.</span> <span id="s1873">We got quite attached to some of those babies.</span> <span id="s1874">And that's how I met Jirca.</span> <span id="s1875">He was the brother of one of the nursing mothers there, you see.</span> <span id="s1876">Otherwise, I don't think I would have known him.</span> <span id="s1877">And, you know, we were both young, and we went on walks together.</span> <span id="s1878">One thing I remember so much from Theresienstadt is we got such a love and appreciation of the stars, of the firmament.</span> <span id="s1879">You know that was one of the few things we were allowed to do.</span> <span id="s1880">We could look up and look, and he knew the stars very well, so he gave me a lasting appreciation of constellations, and of planets, and first magnitude stars, and I was very happy about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Wasn't there a situation where he took you to – he was ringing church bells?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1883">And then, during the International Commission, and already before, they decided that the town would look more normal if that, up to then dead, clock up on the church tower would spring to life.</span> <span id="s1884">And somehow, I don't know why, he got the job of winding up that clock, and he took me with him a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1885">And that was a permanent event in my life.</span> <span id="s1886">I can still see every steep step that I climbed, I climbed up there.</span> <span id="s1887">And as I got higher and higher, how the fragrant air came through that opening, ‘cause there was nothing – it was open, you see, on the top, and how that wonderful air from the surrounding countrysides.</span> <span id="s1888">… The ghetto of course had always bad air, also many people, and there was nothing to give air to.</span> <span id="s1889">And here I came up this was this – and then the view – and he could see Prague in the distance.</span> <span id="s1890">I couldn't, but I think he kind of hoped he could see Prague.</span> <span id="s1891">That was his home town.</span> <span id="s1892">But I could see the Elbe and the Eger.</span> <span id="s1893">That was wonderful blue rivers, unpolluted, and I can still remember how I wished I could swim, and how I almost felt the cool water on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s1894">We hadn't been swimming since I was a child, you see.</span> <span id="s1895">And I can still remember how I dreamt that I could dive into that water and feel the water go over my shoulders.</span> <span id="s1896">And then we heard bird sings.</span> <span id="s1897">But also as we looked at the beautiful things, we also saw die Kleine Festung.One of the features of the ghetto was what was called "die Kleine Festung."</span> <span id="s1898">That was – you see, Theresienstadt was a garrison town built in the 1600s or the 1700s for soldiers, and naturally they had to have like a correction place for soldiers that needed to be punished, and that was die – a medieval fortress – a medieval, almost like a torture fortress, where they put the soldiers that needed to be isolated.</span> <span id="s1899">And they recovered this again from medieval times and put the Jews in there.</span> <span id="s1900">Took terrible consequences.</span> <span id="s1901">The Jews there were – were never returned.</span> <span id="s1902">It was also, by the way, a historical place.</span> <span id="s1903">The young man by the name of Gavrilo Princip who shot the Crown Prince in 1914, and started World War I in Sarajevo – I say “Sarajevo” – You say it differently, don't you?</span> <span id="s1904">How do you say it?</span> <span id="s1905">Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s1906">Sarajevo, which is so much in the news now.</span> <span id="s1907">That how World War I started as you 79 The little fortress (German) probably know.</span> <span id="s1908">It was called, “the shot that went around the world.”</span> <span id="s1909">That young man – that young Princip was imprisoned in the Kleine Festung, and then he died just before the end of the war, and he's buried outside the Kleine Festung.</span> <span id="s1910">So it has a very historical side to it.</span> <span id="s1911">So this is what we saw from up on the tower and I only, reluctantly, always, went back down into the ghetto after he took me up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">03:38:47</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: It was more than once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: I think it was a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1915">It kind of kaleidoscoped into one because each time it was such a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s1916">It think it was maybe two, three times.</span> <span id="s1917">And he was, naturally, not allowed to take me up there, so by the time we came down into the, into the ground floor again, he always had to look out first that no SS was around and then he could sneak me out.</span> <span id="s1918">We took pleasure where we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: So there's always this combination of the background being so sad and deprived, and yet–</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1921">I always feel a little guilty because I did not go through that terrible hell that so many of other Jews went through.</span> <span id="s1922">I never was in a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1923">I was never in real danger of my life.</span> <span id="s1924">I was, of course, constantly, ‘cause all the time those transports would go out – and I survived.</span> <span id="s1925">And I that's – I think part of why I'm still religious – I did survive.</span> <span id="s1926">Miracles did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Let me ask you a couple of other things.</span> <span id="s1928">Did you menstruate in the ghetto, or did it stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: It stopped.</span> <span id="s1930">It stopped.</span> <span id="s1931">We were so worried when they took our, our napkins as contraband in the Schleusse.</span> <span id="s1932">And of course, by the way, those were not these elegant little contraptions that young women use today.</span> <span id="s1933">It was something that we used, had to wash out afterwards, and used again.</span> <span id="s1934">And we were so worried when it was... when those were taken from us, and then we didn't need them for which reason I don't know.</span> <span id="s1935">And it impacted us differently.</span> <span id="s1936">Some of us became very heavy and very fat, and others became very thin after we lost our menstruation – and I kind of got a little thin and Eva got a little heavier – I don't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">03:40:47</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Tell me about Freddi Hirsch.</span> <span id="s1939">What was your relationship with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: Nice.</span> <span id="s1941">I met Freddi when I was still in the Hundertschaft because I was detailed to sweep in front of his home – his children's home.</span> <span id="s1942">He was the leader of the children's home.</span> <span id="s1943">He was already a prominent Zionist before, and he attracted the young people around himself.</span> <span id="s1944">And then when he got out of the Hundertschaft, he was detailed to the children's home to work with the children.</span> <span id="s1945">It was of course forbidden to have classes or real instructions, so he always was able to lead and guide and instruct the children kind of on the sly.</span> <span id="s1946">While they were supposedly working, he would give instructions, and he was very much beloved.</span> <span id="s1947">He was a very lovely young man – a real Zionist – a real ethical figure.</span> <span id="s1948">And the Germans respected him for a long time, and then the reason he got into the next transport was – yes, I remember that.</span> <span id="s1949">A transport of children from Czechoslovakia showed up – from Slovakia showed up – alone – barefoot, in terrible condition – and we heard about it.</span> <span id="s1950">And they didn't speak anything but Polish, and he of course spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1951">And we... Eva went as a nurse to that transport also.</span> <span id="s1952">I didn't.</span> <span id="s1953">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1954">That was the one time we didn't do things together.</span> <span id="s1955">That transport was a group of children whose parents had been shot, and these children had witnessed that, and they were very frightened – very intimidated.</span> <span id="s1956">And the order came from the SS that we were not allowed to speak to them.</span> <span id="s1957">We were not allowed to know that their parents were shot and killed, and the kids, not speaking any other language but Polish, were not permitted to speak to us who spoke German.</span> <span id="s1958">So Freddi Hirsch disobeyed that order and spoke to the children in a soothing way, and he was caught at that, and he was, of course, put onto the next transport.</span> <span id="s1959">And he wrote a card back that I remember.</span> <span id="s1960">After some time he wrote back that... First for a long time we didn't hear from him, and then he wrote back, "We should do all we can to stay in the ghetto and not to volunteer and not to provoke our entrance into an east transport."</span> <span id="s1961">And we were puzzled about this because we thought we had it very bad.</span> <span id="s1962">We had no news from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1963">We did not know how bad they had it, and so we, we got our first inkling how bad Auschwitz must be if he advised us to stay where we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">03:44:09</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: So you heard no – did you continually hear rumors about gas chambers, or did they stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: That stopped.</span> <span id="s1967">I heard that once in Berlin, "Die werden alle vergast.”</span> <span id="s1968">And I thought that guy was out of his mind to make such a statement, and then we didn't hear it anymore.</span> <span id="s1969">We didn't hear it anymore.</span> <span id="s1970">We heard only that they were working, and they couldn't write for a while they could write, but only for a while.</span> <span id="s1971">And I never heard from Eva and Werner Simmon.</span> <span id="s1972">I surely would have heard from them if they had lived.</span> <span id="s1973">And when Golly was deported to Auschwitz, or rather when she followed her husband to Auschwitz, I didn't hear from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">So, there was something fishy going on and we knew it.</span> <span id="s1975">But also we – I think we purposely closed our minds to it.</span> <span id="s1976">We purposely – because we were so apt to go into the next transport, and why should we think we were going to be killed right away So, self preservation, we took that out of our minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: And who was choosing the people to go on transports?</span> <span id="s1978">Also the Judenrat?</span> <span id="s1979">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1980">I have to assume so.</span> <span id="s1981">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: You're not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">80 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to oversee Jewish communities and ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: I'm not sure, but.</span> <span id="s1985">… Yes, of course it was the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1986">I am sure, because when the October transports – the one that Jirca went on, just before the Commission.</span> <span id="s1987">Then all of a sudden Edelstein was taken prisoner, and his wife was told to bring food three times a day, and to bring fresh clothing once a week.</span> <span id="s1988">And she never got any – any dishes back, and she never got any dirty laundry back.</span> <span id="s1989">He was, as we know now, he was already in the Kleine Festung and probably already dead.</span> <span id="s1990">And the reason was that he did not want to cooperate in those transports.</span> <span id="s1991">He refused to put that many people up for transports.</span> <span id="s1992">So the answer to your original question is “yes.”</span> <span id="s1993">It was the Jews who made the transport.</span> <span id="s1994">Of course it had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">The Germans didn't do it anymore.</span> <span id="s1996">Why should they?</span> <span id="s1997">And it was the Jews who worked in the Schleusse.</span> <span id="s1998">The Schleusse of course went both ways – in and out.</span> <span id="s1999">And who took the people to the cattle cars and everything else?</span> <span id="s2000">Thank God I never had to do that.</span> <span id="s2001">I only went to all the incoming transports to see if I would find anybody I knew.</span> <span id="s2002">And, in fact, by then the trains came right into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2003">And there was a certain barrack where we could go to and just look out the window and see the people come.</span> <span id="s2004">Eva and I did that.</span> <span id="s2005">We watched to see if we knew anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">03:47:20</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: When the people worked in the Schleusse, do you think they stole things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Yes, I would think so.</span> <span id="s2009">I would think so.</span> <span id="s2010">I would think so.</span> <span id="s2011">I don't think they considered it stealing ‘cause–</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: No, no–</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: ‘Cause it was that – it was already stolen in the first place.</span> <span id="s2014">Q: I didn't mean that in the derogatory sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: But I think so, yes.</span> <span id="s2016">And then they could do a little good with it.</span> <span id="s2017">And then often they would exchange these things for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2018">Cigarettes were very coveted.</span> <span id="s2019">Everybody wanted to smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: Don't ask me, I never smoked, and I never touched a cigarette – or maybe I touched one once or twice – but they loved cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2022">I think it got them away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2023">I think it made them feel normal again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: And why didn't you smoke?</span> <span id="s2025">A: I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Did Eva?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: No.</span> <span id="s2028">Never.</span> <span id="s2029">No.</span> <span id="s2030">It wasn't done.</span> <span id="s2031">At home nobody smoked.</span> <span id="s2032">It never occurred to me to smoke.</span> <span id="s2033">Maybe I did once or twice, and I think I was very sick afterwards, so I never did it again.</span> <span id="s2034">I still don't smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: What was your food like?</span> <span id="s2036">What was your daily–?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: The food.</span> <span id="s2038">When we came in, as our belongings were taken away from us, we got in return one little thing – one little pot kind of a thing out of metal, that we had to hook onto ourselves – and not to lose it, because we didn't get a second one.</span> <span id="s2039">If we lost it, we just didn't get any food.</span> <span id="s2040">So we hung onto it for dear life.</span> <span id="s2041">And three times a day, while we were still in the Hundertschaft – in the beginning – three times a day we went to the Essensausgabe– the distribution center for the food.</span> <span id="s2042">And in the morning we got coffee, and they called it einebuchta– was kind of a square shaped piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2043">And at noontime we got soup and bread, and a little margarine, I think.</span> <span id="s2044">And in the evening we got soup, and a little sugar, and coffee.</span> <span id="s2045">And that had to do us.</span> <span id="s2046">And maybe a little bit bread again.</span> <span id="s2047">But then when we worked in the children's home, then the food came to us already.</span> <span id="s2048">It came into the home and it was much better then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Was it prepared in the home, or was it already prepared?</span> <span id="s2050">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2051">There was one central station that did all the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: And so there was a difference between the kind of food certain groups got and other groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: Only in the way that it was a little more that we got.</span> <span id="s2054">A little more volume, quantity.</span> <span id="s2055">And these places where they distributed the food, mostly the old people had to go because they had no place of work.</span> <span id="s2056">The people who worked – I have to assume – that it was the same as in the children's home – that the food was brought to them, rather they stopping their wor.</span> <span id="s2057">… Of course, it had to be that way ‘cause the Germans wouldn't allow the people to wander off at noontime and go to lunch, huh?</span> <span id="s2058">That wasn't done.</span> <span id="s2059">So I have to assume, then the food came in a little better quantity.</span> <span id="s2060">And later on, during and after the Commission, there was also better quality.</span> <span id="s2061">There was sent much better food.</span> <span id="s2062">I remember my agony when I saw for the first time some meat swimming in that soup.</span> <span id="s2063">Up to then there was no meat.</span> <span id="s2064">It was just – Eva and I always compared it to, to the dishwater that we threw out after washing our dishes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">You know, a little, little eyes of fat swimming on it, like it was from our dishes at home when we were still living normally.</span> <span id="s2066">And then suddenly I found a piece of meat in there and I didn't know what to do because I hadn't eaten meat up to then.</span> <span id="s2067">In the hospital, in Berlin, up to – after I left was kosher, and up to then there was no problem, and suddenly I was 81 Food distribution (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">82 A (German) 83 Baked yeasted dumpling (German) confronted with a piece of meat, and I remember my agony.</span> <span id="s2069">“Should I eat it, or shouldn't I?”</span> <span id="s2070">Eva had no such qualms because she was never kosher, and she ate it of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">03:51:45</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: I ate it too, but after a long struggle.</span> <span id="s2074">And it didn't taste good.</span> <span id="s2075">I was sorry I ate it.</span> <span id="s2076">It was probably horse meat and I shouldn't even have touched it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Did you feel guilty?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: I didn't feel guilty, but I felt sorry.</span> <span id="s2079">And Eva said, "You have to keep your strength up, and you have to eat it," and this and that, but I shouldn't have listened to her.</span> <span id="s2080">I did okay without the meat.</span> <span id="s2081">I think I didn't eat it a second time.</span> <span id="s2082">But I remember that so well because it was such a such an opening into decision making all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s2083">Up to now you didn't have to make any decisions, and all of a sudden you.</span> <span id="s2084">… That was the first important decision, and then the next important decision was to go on the Swiss transport or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">03:52:47</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Can you give an impression of sanitary conditions?</span> <span id="s2087">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Water, toilets – I mean, what were those conditions like in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2090">I can give you a very clear picture of that.</span> <span id="s2091">When we were still living in the barracks, at first – and you mustn't think that after I left, everybody else left in the barracks also.</span> <span id="s2092">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2093">The barracks were always constantly filled with newcomers.</span> <span id="s2094">Every newcomer first had to stay in the barracks for quite a while, so it was very filthy there, very, very filthy.</span> <span id="s2095">And it was like some toilets for the whole barracks.</span> <span id="s2096">It was directly taken over from when they used it as military barracks, so whatever it was, that I don't remember that too well.</span> <span id="s2097">It was just, you know, very primitive.</span> <span id="s2098">This was 1940ish and there was not very great luxury.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: Like a latrine, or was there actually running water?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: There was no running water.</span> <span id="s2101">I think it was a latrine.</span> <span id="s2102">Yes, I believe it was.</span> <span id="s2103">You see that was not so strange to me because in Ansbach, way back when I was a child, that's all there was.</span> <span id="s2104">So it was not a culture shock that if somebody would have to go there today – you know – it was the outhouse.</span> <span id="s2105">It was where we went, you see.</span> <span id="s2106">Just Berlin was much more elegant there.</span> <span id="s2107">We had a real toilet.</span> <span id="s2108">But, so I was back in my youth – so what?</span> <span id="s2109">But in the home for the children, when Eva and I lived in the basement, I remember very well the way we showered and the way we washed our hair, it was just a low faucet, and we had to kind of crouch under it when there was warm water, or even had cold water.</span> <span id="s2110">And I remember Eva and I washing our hairs, each other, ‘cause she doesn't remember all of that.</span> <span id="s2111">I have to tell her again and again how I washed her hair and she washed my hair.</span> <span id="s2112">And I remember that clearly, but about the toilet I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2113">I think we had running water in the home already.</span> <span id="s2114">You see those things didn't stay with me because, you know, it was something that just had to be done, and you did it, and it didn't stay with me.</span> <span id="s2115">I think we had a running toilet, although I'm not positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">03:55:16</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: And what about soap and shampoo, and where did you get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: Soap?</span> <span id="s2119">We had soap.</span> <span id="s2120">We had some primitive soap, like Waschseife– these big bars that were given to us.</span> <span id="s2121">We had to have soap because we washed the children also.</span> <span id="s2122">In the home it was clean.</span> <span id="s2123">Now you asked about sanitary conditions.</span> <span id="s2124">We had, we had to keep that basement room clean, naturally.</span> <span id="s2125">There was no maid service.</span> <span id="s2126">And we had to wash our own things in that little faucet.</span> <span id="s2127">But the big, big problem in Theresienstadt were the bedbugs, and we could not rid ourselves of the bedbugs ever.</span> <span id="s2128">In the summer, no matter how we tried to keep the beds clean, or anything – naturally we didn't change beds all that often ‘cause we had to wash the bedding under that little water and hang it out to dry in the winter.</span> <span id="s2129">I don't think we ever changed beds.</span> <span id="s2130">So we had enormous problem with bedbugs – the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s2131">And in the summer we just took a blanket and slept outdoors.</span> <span id="s2132">And there again it was always that beautiful sky.</span> <span id="s2133">There were no lights to interfere, you see.</span> <span id="s2134">The whole, the whole ghetto was blacked out – number one because they wouldn't spend any of the – any electricity on us, and number two, it was wartime.</span> <span id="s2135">We had to be blacked out.</span> <span id="s2136">We couldn't attract enemy fire.</span> <span id="s2137">So we slept outdoors under that gorgeous sky.</span> <span id="s2138">And once in a while the ghetto, house by house, would be de-debugged, and it didn't do a thing.</span> <span id="s2139">After a week or two the bugs were back.</span> <span id="s2140">So that was a really big problem.</span> <span id="s2141">We scratched and scratched, and then those things got infected, and it was a mess.</span> <span id="s2142">There was nothing we could do, no matter how we tried.</span> <span id="s2143">And you asked about the water.</span> <span id="s2144">I have no recollection of it.</span> <span id="s2145">It was probably drinkable.</span> <span id="s2146">I don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">03:57:27</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: You don't remember if you were thirsty?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: No, I don't remember feeling thirsty.</span> <span id="s2150">I think once we were in the home there was always water because of the children.</span> <span id="s2151">We took very good care of those children, and I remember how strict we were with, with the mothers to keep their children clean, and not to bring in anything, ‘cause there was always lice and bedbugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">84 Washing soap (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">03:57:55 End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">04:00:05</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: Mrs. Haas, can you tell us something about the hospital and the children, and what you and Eva and the other nurses were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: The children's home.</span> <span id="s2159">It was not a hospital.</span> <span id="s2160">Q: The children's home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: The children's home.</span> <span id="s2162">Yes, I can recollect that very well.</span> <span id="s2163">We had from babies to – I would say, two years old.</span> <span id="s2164">Now these were children that came in transports.</span> <span id="s2165">A lot of them were of mixed marriages – the so-called Mischlinge that the Germans didn't know what to do with.</span> <span id="s2166">These were not necessarily sick children.</span> <span id="s2167">This was a regular children's home – babies' home – for which I actually was trained.</span> <span id="s2168">That was my diploma.</span> <span id="s2169">And we, we took care of them as best we could.</span> <span id="s2170">For instance, I remember we had to wash the diapers out all the time.</span> <span id="s2171">You know, naturally, I mean what do you expect in the ‘40s in Germany?</span> <span id="s2172">And hang them up to dry and use them over and over again.</span> <span id="s2173">And the children stayed with us day and night.</span> <span id="s2174">The mothers could come and visit.</span> <span id="s2175">In some cases they nursed and came three times a day, but in most – in all cases they had to work otherwise, and just came to visit their kids.</span> <span id="s2176">And I remember we were fairly strict with those mothers.</span> <span id="s2177">We didn't let them – we were the bosses, not the mothers, you see.</span> <span id="s2178">We told them when they could take up their kids and not.</span> <span id="s2179">We were always afraid they would bring in lice, or bedbugs, or disease, or whatever – and these were our kids and we were keeping them nice and clean and healthy.</span> <span id="s2180">We had a physician coming, I don't know how often now.</span> <span id="s2181">But if one of the kids were sick we sent them to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">And we worked very hard.</span> <span id="s2183">We had to do everything.</span> <span id="s2184">We had to clean the rooms, do the washing, we had to feed the kids.</span> <span id="s2185">The food came in.</span> <span id="s2186">We didn't have to cook it.</span> <span id="s2187">So it was an all around job.</span> <span id="s2188">And we – in some cases when we got very attached to the children, it was terrible when they were called on transport.</span> <span id="s2189">And then after a while we hardened against this.</span> <span id="s2190">We tried not to get attached, but that's hard to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">04:03:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: I can't imagine if there was a mood over all the children, but can you describe something of what went on with the children and your actual interactions with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: I remember we took them out into that little park.</span> <span id="s2194">Just in front of the home – just in front of Bergstrasse 14 there was a little park, just a little enclosure where there were greenery and a couple of trees.</span> <span id="s2195">And I remember we took them out into that park.</span> <span id="s2196">We dressed them up warmly if the weather was warm, and that was always so nice.</span> <span id="s2197">We could sit in the park for a few minutes watching our kids, but really we were sitting in the park – and just to get them some fresh air and some normal activities.</span> <span id="s2198">Otherwise, we didn't do anything with them.</span> <span id="s2199">They slept, and were fed, and were cleaned, and bathed, and slept again.</span> <span id="s2200">That was all we did.</span> <span id="s2201">We couldn't do anything with them.</span> <span id="s2202">Later on when the Commission came, then they built in that same little park, playgrounds, and swings, and rockinghorses, and everything.</span> <span id="s2203">And we had to instruct the kids what to do with them.</span> <span id="s2204">And then the kids in turn, these were the older kids, were instructed to play act – that they were always playing on these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: What is the age range of these children in the home?</span> <span id="s2206">A: The age range?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: From newborn to about three.</span> <span id="s2209">Q: So, there's not a lot of –?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: After they were three, then they got into that home that Freddi Hirsch was, was – or maybe four I would think.</span> <span id="s2211">No, we didn't keep them ‘til four.</span> <span id="s2212">There must have been another in- between step, because Freddi's children were also already much older.</span> <span id="s2213">I think there was an in-between step.</span> <span id="s2214">We had the small ones, and he had already the trainable ones.</span> <span id="s2215">There must have been one other step in between, but at the moment I don't know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: Did they cry a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: No.</span> <span id="s2218">They were happy.</span> <span id="s2219">They were cute.</span> <span id="s2220">They were kids.</span> <span id="s2221">What always surprised us was how healthy they were.</span> <span id="s2222">And also what surprised us was that the mothers could even produce kids.</span> <span id="s2223">The mothers themselves were dehydrated and undernourished, and they produced perfectly nice kids.</span> <span id="s2224">No, I would think those kids were okay.</span> <span id="s2225">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s2226">They went into their deaths without ever knowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">04:06:31</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: Did you – did you try not to be affectionate with them so as not to get close to them, or was that not a–?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: At first it wasn't a problem.</span> <span id="s2230">At first we were very close to them, but don't forget they had mothers.</span> <span id="s2231">We didn't need to be that close to them.</span> <span id="s2232">And later on we tried not to be, not to be in love with them at all, ‘cause we knew they were going.</span> <span id="s2233">Later on, as the transports escalated, they were going as quickly as they came in, and then we didn't go too close to them anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Do you think that affected the children?</span> <span id="s2235">Did they notice?</span> <span id="s2236">Or was the turnover so great–?</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: No.</span> <span id="s2238">I don't think it affected the children.</span> <span id="s2239">We still gave them all the care we wanted to, we needed to, but we just didn't let our hearts go out to them.</span> <span id="s2240">They were cute kids.</span> <span id="s2241">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s2242">That whole Theresienstadt was just another collection center, and it took us a while to realize that.</span> <span id="s2243">It was just another center to go to your death.</span> <span id="s2244">And some, of course, died there too.</span> <span id="s2245">The old people died easily.</span> <span id="s2246">And some of the children died too – and some of the other people.</span> <span id="s2247">Disease, malnutrition, severe depressions.</span> <span id="s2248">I don't think there were many suicides.</span> <span id="s2249">At least I wasn't aware of it.</span> <span id="s2250">I wasn't aware of suicides.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">04:07:38</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: But in Berlin there were a lot of suicides.</span> <span id="s2253">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: In Berlin there were a lot of suicides.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2256">In Berlin was a lot of suicide.</span> <span id="s2257">I was not aware, maybe I was just not aware of it, I can't tell you of any suicides in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2258">No, I remember.</span> <span id="s2259">And anyone who died was burned, and the ashes were put into little bags, and then – I was in that building once.</span> <span id="s2260">I don't, I don't remember why.</span> <span id="s2261">It was – you see, those, those walls that surrounded the ghetto were hollow inside, you see.</span> <span id="s2262">You could walk into them.</span> <span id="s2263">Those were huge walls – huge medieval walls.</span> <span id="s2264">They were hollow inside, and on top of them there was earth, and there was grass.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">That was called die Bastei.And later on you could plant vegetables up here, and you could walk up there and have a ballgame up there.</span> <span id="s2266">But what I'm thinking, at the moment, these urns, if you want to call them urns – it was just in little paper bags with a name on them, were stored in those – between those huge walls.</span> <span id="s2267">And for some reason or other I was in there once.</span> <span id="s2268">I don't know why or how I got there.</span> <span id="s2269">But I remember being there and seeing those rows and rows of – of little packages with ashes.</span> <span id="s2270">I have no recollection how I got there.</span> <span id="s2271">And then, after a while, there were so many that the SS ordered the Jewish government to dispose of them.</span> <span id="s2272">And then they put them onto a barge, and the barge was taken out into the River Elbe and was sunk.</span> <span id="s2273">So a lot of people's ashes are sunk in the River Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: Was there a crematory to burn the bodies?</span> <span id="s2275">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: Was there a crematory in Theresienstadt to burn the bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: Yes there was.</span> <span id="s2278">I don't know where it was, but yes there was.</span> <span id="s2279">Ya.</span> <span id="s2280">And after we left there was another crematorium being built – actually before we left already.</span> <span id="s2281">There were rumors that a crematorium was being built, but then we left and I don't know what became of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Did you dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">85 The bastion (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">04:10:00</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: In Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: In Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: No, not that I remember.</span> <span id="s2288">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s2289">It's a good question.</span> <span id="s2290">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s2291">Eva and I fantasized a lot.</span> <span id="s2292">Eva and I, in our spare time, we, we built some huge dream castles.</span> <span id="s2293">We called it – first of all we talked a lot about food ‘cause we were always hungry, and we gave it a name.</span> <span id="s2294">We called it “Magenonanie.”</span> <span id="s2295">It's really a name we made up.</span> <span id="s2296">“Magen” is your stomach.</span> <span id="s2297">So it was “Stomach-Onanie,” and “Onanie” is masturbation.</span> <span id="s2298">So we had a very nice time masturbating our stomachs with dreams of food.</span> <span id="s2299">Of all the things we had eaten, and all the things we're going to be eating again.</span> <span id="s2300">And that satisfied us for the moment.</span> <span id="s2301">I think we made up that name.</span> <span id="s2302">I've never heard it before or since.</span> <span id="s2303">And then we also dreamt that we would get out.</span> <span id="s2304">That kept us going.</span> <span id="s2305">We always dreamt that we, we would survive all this.</span> <span id="s2306">We were hoping that we wouldn't get into a transport.</span> <span id="s2307">If we would go into a transport, we knew that was the end.</span> <span id="s2308">But we were hoping very....</span> <span id="s2309">And the big question was if one of us would go into a transport, would the other one voluntarily go along?</span> <span id="s2310">And we kind of didn't make a decision on that, and thank God it never came up.</span> <span id="s2311">And then we dreamt that we would get out, and get married, and find love.</span> <span id="s2312">You see, we were by now 22, 23.</span> <span id="s2313">Love was not a thing we were very familiar with, aside from these flirtations and these....</span> <span id="s2314">You know, somebody once brought me a bunch of flowers that they had picked up on the Bastei, that, that was the height of courtship.</span> <span id="s2315">You know, that was fabulous.</span> <span id="s2316">I still remember it, and the smell of them, and the look of them – and just the whole gesture of receiving flowers, you know.</span> <span id="s2317">So anyway... So we dreamt we would lead a normal life, and have husbands, and have children – and then we let our fantasy go wild, and we said, "And then our children will marry."</span> <span id="s2318">And we promised ourselves our children would marry each other.</span> <span id="s2319">And, as you know, it did become true.</span> <span id="s2320">My son – my daughter and her son married, but not because we wanted it to.</span> <span id="s2321">I was so surprised when my daughter called up and said, “Joe and I are engaged.”</span> <span id="s2322">I was the most surprised person in the world.</span> <span id="s2323">Also, 30 years before that, Eva and I had dreamt about it.</span> <span id="s2324">That was one of the miracles of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">04:12:52</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: Was this helpful to have these fantasies and these conversations about–?</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: I would think so.</span> <span id="s2328">It certainly didn't do us any harm.</span> <span id="s2329">I think it got us over some rough spots.</span> <span id="s2330">And you know we had to fill the time.</span> <span id="s2331">You couldn't just sit and chew your thumbs and bite your nails all the time.</span> <span id="s2332">You had to do something.</span> <span id="s2333">Normal activities were far away, so we, we dreamt and talked and–</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: Were these very detailed conversations about what your life would be like really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">86 Stomach masturbation (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2337">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2338">I always did want to marry a doctor and have four children.</span> <span id="s2339">Q: Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: Why not?</span> <span id="s2341">I could dream.</span> <span id="s2342">But it came true – that's the miracle.</span> <span id="s2343">And I had two boys and two girls, just like I dreamt, and visualized, and hoped for, and prayed for.</span> <span id="s2344">And all of them are now married.</span> <span id="s2345">The youngest one just had a baby a couple of weeks ago.</span> <span id="s2346">We went to the Brit,and right here in Washington.</span> <span id="s2347">It was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s2348">I'm very fortunate.</span> <span id="s2349">My husband is well and with me.</span> <span id="s2350">So, it's really fortunate.</span> <span id="s2351">And that's why I'm still religious.</span> <span id="s2352">That's why I have made peace with, with God.</span> <span id="s2353">After all he has thrown a lot my way that other people can only wish for.</span> <span id="s2354">And so I live with that, with that multi-faceted God who can dispense great hardship, and great joy.</span> <span id="s2355">Maybe that's the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">04:14:34</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: So you never lost your faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: I struggled a lot.</span> <span id="s2359">I struggled a lot, and I argued a lot with people, and I philosophized a great deal with, especially, one of my cousins who also remained very religious.</span> <span id="s2360">And I philosophized a great deal with him.</span> <span id="s2361">In fact I still have some of those letters that we wrote back and forth way back after I was released from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2362">And I struggled a great deal, but then by the time I married a very religious man, then the struggle was over and I had to come to some, to some peace within myself.</span> <span id="s2363">And the peace is that there is no answer.</span> <span id="s2364">That I have to live with a God who is good, and not good at the same time.</span> <span id="s2365">And the answer is that there is no answer, that you have to just, just accept it.</span> <span id="s2366">But the thing is you have to have something.</span> <span id="s2367">I can't turn to, to drugs, or to hippy living, or to anything.</span> <span id="s2368">You have to have something in your life.</span> <span id="s2369">So my something is religion, and that's the answer for me.</span> <span id="s2370">It's very unsatisfactory, but it's the best I can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">04:16:03</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Did you ever get depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2374">I became very depressed after my first child was born.</span> <span id="s2375">The interesting thing is, my mother was deported on the ninth of November, and my son was born on the ninth of November.</span> <span id="s2376">My mother died on the eleventh of November, as I found out much later, and my second son was born on the eleventh of November.</span> <span id="s2377">So there is this what I have just talked about.</span> <span id="s2378">How do you live with something like that?</span> <span id="s2379">So, what was your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Did you ever get depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">87 Circumcision (Hebrew)</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: Did I ever get depressed?</span> <span id="s2383">Yes.</span> <span id="s2384">After my first son was born I fell into a deep depression.</span> <span id="s2385">I didn't function anymore.</span> <span id="s2386">I had a home, I had a husband, I had a son.</span> <span id="s2387">I was living in freedom.</span> <span id="s2388">I had food on the table without end and I couldn't function any further.</span> <span id="s2389">And my husband, who is a physician, advised me to seek professional help, which was in those days, in the early ‘40s, a stigma.</span> <span id="s2390">You didn't go to a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s2391">You didn't go to a psychologist.</span> <span id="s2392">You just dealt with your problems.</span> <span id="s2393">But wisely enough he advised me to get professional help.</span> <span id="s2394">And the interesting answer was that I had a guilt complex.</span> <span id="s2395">Now in the early ‘40s that was unheard of.</span> <span id="s2396">What was a guilt complex?</span> <span id="s2397">Nobody knew that.</span> <span id="s2398">Now we know that most people who do go through a hard time come out with a guilt feeling.</span> <span id="s2399">And my complex was, "Why me?</span> <span id="s2400">Why am I living this Life of Riley now?</span> <span id="s2401">Why not my sister?</span> <span id="s2402">Why not my husband's sisters?</span> <span id="s2403">Why wasn't my mother alive to enjoy that baby with me?</span> <span id="s2404">My husband's mother or father?"</span> <span id="s2405">Everybody was gone with the exception of my father, in both our families.</span> <span id="s2406">And why was I alive?</span> <span id="s2407">What did I do that guaranteed me such joy?</span> <span id="s2408">And the normal reaction, as I now know of the mind and the body, is a depression.</span> <span id="s2409">And I got over it because I got help.</span> <span id="s2410">And then I also got over it because I felt I had to do something for that gift of life, and I got over it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">04:18:35</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: How did you get out of Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: That was another miracle.</span> <span id="s2414">That was another miracle.</span> <span id="s2415">I can still see Eva and me sitting on our bunks.</span> <span id="s2416">I can still see that in my mind.</span> <span id="s2417">We were beginning to be very low, even Eva in all her Viennese humor and gaiety.</span> <span id="s2418">It was February 1, 1945, and we were sitting on the upper bunk.</span> <span id="s2419">We changed bunks every so often because the window was right at the upper bunk level, and why should one only look out the window all the time, so we changed bunks, and I don't know whose, whose turn it was, but we were sitting on the upper bunk and watching the cobblestones out in the window, and then somebody came.</span> <span id="s2420">And all we could see, of course, was just up to their mid-calves.</span> <span id="s2421">And anyone that ever came brought bad news, or God forbid the slip to go into the transport, so naturally we were – we stopped our conversation and we were very much afraid.</span> <span id="s2422">And then the person that came said that the next transport would go to Switzerland, February 1, 1945.</span> <span id="s2423">The war was on, killing was still in high gear, and somebody was going to take us to Switzerland?</span> <span id="s2424">And so at first we just ignored it.</span> <span id="s2425">And then the next morning, we heard it again.</span> <span id="s2426">And then we heard it from people whom we trusted that were in with the administration, and we heard – especially we, we young women who were still looking pretty well, we heard, "Go ahead.</span> <span id="s2427">Go and register for that transport.</span> <span id="s2428">Hurry up."</span> <span id="s2429">And so after a while, Eva in her light – I would never have registered , I'm sure I thank my whole life to her – she said, "Come on, let's go.</span> <span id="s2430">Let's go.</span> <span id="s2431">Let's register.</span> <span id="s2432">Why wait for anything else?"</span> <span id="s2433">And of course all we could think of was all those transports that they said would go to Palestine, and they never got to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2434">So I said, "But what if we end up in Auschwitz?"</span> <span id="s2435">So she said, "Then our problems are solved if we should join the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Then we're together already anyway.</span> <span id="s2437">So, nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s2438">We go."</span> <span id="s2439">04:21:00 So we went, and we had to register, which was very different from the other transports.</span> <span id="s2440">We were looked over.</span> <span id="s2441">We had to answer questions, especially the question I remember was, "Did any one of your family ever die in Theresienstadt, or was sent away to the East?"</span> <span id="s2442">And we had nobody, you see.</span> <span id="s2443">So we could say “no.”</span> <span id="s2444">And then we saw him write down that we could get into the transport.</span> <span id="s2445">And then the next day – this was all packed into two days, you see.</span> <span id="s2446">There was no way of come back in two weeks or anything like that, no red tape of any kind.</span> <span id="s2447">So then the next day we got that brown slip that I showed you before where it says that we should appear on February the fourth, at seven o'clock in the evening, with one suitcase – no bedrolls, no rucksacks, nothing of the kind – and nicely dressed and punctual.</span> <span id="s2448">The Germans were very much for punctuality, whether that was for your liberation or for your death, you be punctual.</span> <span id="s2449">So we went, and we left the rest of the people in the basement room, and we really didn't believe we were really going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2450">We did believe something was different.</span> <span id="s2451">And in the train, it was not a cattle car this time, in the train we got packages of marmalade, and stuff that I didn't even know what to do with.</span> <span id="s2452">And then we left, Eva and I very much together, and we really got to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2453">And when we got to Switzerland, we crossed the border into Switzerland I remember three things that stayed in my mind very much.</span> <span id="s2454">We looked out the window.</span> <span id="s2455">Number one, nobody yelled us, "Get back in or you'll be shot," you know.</span> <span id="s2456">And number two, the people smiled.</span> <span id="s2457">I hadn't seen a person smile in 12 years.</span> <span id="s2458">What was there to smile at?</span> <span id="s2459">All through my youth and my growing up.</span> <span id="s2460">The people smiled at us.</span> <span id="s2461">And the person that – then some Swiss people in uniform came in and they were nice to us, and that was unheard of, anyone in uniform being nice to Jews.</span> <span id="s2462">What's this?</span> <span id="s2463">Gan Eden?Already we're dead and we're in paradise.</span> <span id="s2464">Was unheard of.</span> <span id="s2465">And then the third thing I remember, night fell and the lights stayed on.</span> <span id="s2466">There was no war in Switzerland, you see.</span> <span id="s2467">The lights purposely stayed on so the airplanes overhead could tell that it was Switzerland and wouldn't bomb it.</span> <span id="s2468">But to us it was an epiphany.</span> <span id="s2469">It was unheard of.</span> <span id="s2470">So then we were allowed to pick one of the several places where we could go, and Eva and I stayed together and picked Les Avants, and then she fell in love with a French refugee who had also come, and she followed him to France because she was completely alone.</span> <span id="s2471">And I contacted my father, and then he let me come over to America, and I married.</span> <span id="s2472">And by gosh when our kids became teenagers they visited back and forth, and Jeanfell in love with Polly– right under my eyes, and I didn't see it happen.</span> <span id="s2473">And I didn't know for many years just how that all came about.</span> <span id="s2474">May I tell you just very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">04:24:38 Maybe you know it already, but to me it was a very, very fascinating story because I discovered it myself.</span> <span id="s2476">It wasn't told to me.</span> <span id="s2477">I went to the National Archives.</span> <span id="s2478">I had an advisor, Tim Mulligan, to guide me through the whole process, and I discovered the documents and read them, and I found out that at the end of 1944, a Jewish-Swiss woman by the name of Recha Sternbuch, very religious woman.</span> <span id="s2479">… I'll condense the story a little bit – approached 88 Garden of Eden (Hebrew)</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">89 Jean Hammel</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">90 Polly Haas-Hammel Jean-Marie Musy, who was a Swiss – a former Swiss President.</span> <span id="s2482">First she thought she wanted her mother and father to be taken out of Germany.</span> <span id="s2483">Musy was a friend of Himmler's and he had rescued a few Jews before, and she approached him to get her parents out.</span> <span id="s2484">And then, she thought, “Why not try to get all the Jews out?”</span> <span id="s2485">It was late in the war, and she asked him to contact Himmler, and she said she, in turn, would contact the Americans and see if for a certain ransom he would let the Jews out of Germany.</span> <span id="s2486">And by gosh he agreed.</span> <span id="s2487">This is now, of course, I'm condensing this very much.</span> <span id="s2488">He agreed.</span> <span id="s2489">Musy went to Germany to meet him first in his railroad car, then at another secret location, and he agreed.</span> <span id="s2490">And I saw the correspondence between him and – Himmler and Musy – and then later with Sternbuch.</span> <span id="s2491">He wanted first – first he wanted lorries, trucks to continue the war, but the Americans of course didn't do that.</span> <span id="s2492">In the meantime Sternbuch had contacted the Va’ad Ha-Hatsala, which is the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada.</span> <span id="s2493">And they had formed this Va’ad, just for the purpose of helping the Jews – the war was ending – whom they knew would come and needed help, even in Europe.</span> <span id="s2494">And when Sternbuch contacted them, they immediately agreed to collect money to buy out the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">04:26:53 In the end, the first transport, it was exchanged for 5,000,000 American dollars, and was to be of twelve hundred people out of Theresienstadt, because we still looked good, and as I have said before, especially we young people were urged to, to come.</span> <span id="s2496">And then Hitler – and the condition that Himmler made was that he should get good publicity in Swiss and American press.</span> <span id="s2497">Why?</span> <span id="s2498">Because he saw the war ending, and he saw his own fate clearly before him.</span> <span id="s2499">After all, he was the originator of all that killing, and he now wanted to whitewash himself.</span> <span id="s2500">He wanted good publicity and good treatment when the war ended.</span> <span id="s2501">And this was done without Hitler's knowledge.</span> <span id="s2502">And Hitler heard about it.</span> <span id="s2503">When the first 1,200 Jews came out, he heard about it.</span> <span id="s2504">And he immediately disinherited Himmler.</span> <span id="s2505">Himmler had to flee, and he forbade every other contact – every other release – Jews or non-Jews – nobody leaves Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s2506">So we were the only transport.</span> <span id="s2507">And Musy, who it is believed enriched himself from those 5,000,000 dollars went back into obscurity.</span> <span id="s2508">Nobody heard from him.</span> <span id="s2509">Then he died.</span> <span id="s2510">He was already 76 years old at the time of his intercourse with Himmler.</span> <span id="s2511">But he died later.</span> <span id="s2512">Mrs. Sternbuch was much honored and also died much later – in ‘71.</span> <span id="s2513">And Himmler had to flee first from Hitler, who was going to kill him – and he wandered around Lüneburger Heide which is a place – a lonely place in Germany, and then he had to flee from the Allies.</span> <span id="s2514">It was the English – the British that captured that part of Germany.</span> <span id="s2515">And when the Allies did capture him, not knowing whom they had, he took cyanide and killed himself.</span> <span id="s2516">And then they knew it was Himmler.</span> <span id="s2517">It was too late.</span> <span id="s2518">And I was saved.</span> <span id="s2519">He tried to save himself and he saved me instead.</span> <span id="s2520">Isn't that a miracle?</span> <span id="s2521">I was number 1,400– number 1,174 out of those 1,200.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: And Eva was 1,100 and–</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: Seventy-five.</span> <span id="s2524">She was right next – right behind me.</span> <span id="s2525">It's really something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">04:29:35</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: Was it difficult for you to part from Eva when she got married – when she followed this–?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: It was.</span> <span id="s2529">I remember that quite well.</span> <span id="s2530">She, she – we said “goodbye” to each other at the, at the train station in Zurich, and well, of course, she was the happiest woman in the world.</span> <span id="s2531">She was very much in love with Eric, who – her future husband.</span> <span id="s2532">The interesting thing is they were married in Paris, and who would be the officiating Rabbi?</span> <span id="s2533">My own Eli Munk from Ansbach.</span> <span id="s2534">Isn't that something.</span> <span id="s2535">And then when Jean and Polly got engaged and were about to marry, Eli Munk was then a very old gentleman already and he was living in New York, and the marriage was in Boston, and I wanted very much for him to marry our children.</span> <span id="s2536">But then he was already.</span> <span id="s2537">He tried, but he was already too old.</span> <span id="s2538">But, no, it wasn't all that hard for us to, to part.</span> <span id="s2539">We knew we would stay friends, and we knew we would visit each other, and we did.</span> <span id="s2540">She and I had some great visits with each other.</span> <span id="s2541">She lost her husband much too soon, and her son and my daughter had four children, and we are very devoted grandmothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">04:31:02</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: Did you ever talk with Munk once you re-found him about his leaving and not telling people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2545">I didn't say that to him.</span> <span id="s2546">You can't say that to a beloved and respected Rabbi.</span> <span id="s2547">That was something that I, that I have to keep in my own mind because I'm still very friendly with his sons and daughters – especially with his daughter who married the Chief Rabbi of Great Britain, Jakobovitz,and I'm very friendly with Lady Emily(ph).</span> <span id="s2548">And I still adore her father and her mother, although they're now gone.</span> <span id="s2549">But you see when I got to Switzerland there's another very interesting connection.</span> <span id="s2550">They had to fleet Paris – Munks with all their children – in ‘44 or ‘45.</span> <span id="s2551">They had to flee Paris, and they fled to Geneva, and when he heard that I was in Les Avants, which is very close to Geneva, he came immediately to visit me.</span> <span id="s2552">And you know it was like a father coming.</span> <span id="s2553">He was so associated with my youth, and so, so beloved by me that, that was a bond that never dissolved.</span> <span id="s2554">And then they invited me their house, and the children were all very small, and it was a homecoming for me, you see.</span> <span id="s2555">And now I have long forgiven him that.</span> <span id="s2556">I didn't even think about it anymore.</span> <span id="s2557">It just came back to me now as I was thinking about Ansbach.</span> <span id="s2558">But you know, the normal measurements of ethics do not apply to the years of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2559">They just don't apply.</span> <span id="s2560">Was everybody justified in trying to save his or her own life?</span> <span id="s2561">Were people justified in trying to save their own baby, knowing that if that baby wasn't taken, another mother's baby would have to be substituted?</span> <span id="s2562">Was I justified to let my mother and sister?</span> <span id="s2563">Was my father justified to leave us?</span> <span id="s2564">You cannot apply those normal moral standards to the Holocaust years.</span> <span id="s2565">You just can't.</span> <span id="s2566">You just can't.</span> <span id="s2567">So I have long forgiven him that he saved his life, and his whole family's life.</span> <span id="s2568">Why should that whole family also have disappeared?</span> <span id="s2569">And he has since done so much good.</span> <span id="s2570">He's been such an outstanding Rabbi.</span> <span id="s2571">And then we were not bound to obey him even though he said, "Stay.</span> <span id="s2572">Everything will 91 Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovitz be okay."</span> <span id="s2573">Many people left.</span> <span id="s2574">We could have left too, and we did after a while.</span> <span id="s2575">So that's a whole other philosophical problem that you just can't allow yourself to get into it.</span> <span id="s2576">You get lost in the swamp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">04:33:59</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: What was it like to see your father after – what, six years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: Oh, that was, that was after.</span> <span id="s2580">… Let's see, he left in ‘39, and I saw him again in ‘46 – in April of ‘46, and it was very strange.</span> <span id="s2581">I came by boat, and I arrived – I think it was during the Passover – during the Pesach holidays.</span> <span id="s2582">And my father remained very religious.</span> <span id="s2583">And he came to Boston to pick me up.</span> <span id="s2584">I arrived at the Boston Harbor, and he couldn't travel to the boat to pick me up.</span> <span id="s2585">He sent somebody else, and that somebody took me then to an apartment where he stayed and I saw him again.</span> <span id="s2586">And I thought that I would see an old man because I had gone through so much.</span> <span id="s2587">I had lived six lifetimes, you see, that to me it was like a 100 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">And I thought there would be this old, broken man full of grief, and full of sorrow and remorse.</span> <span id="s2589">But it wasn't.</span> <span id="s2590">There was a young, beautiful, dark haired, straight, upright man in his prime – 50 years old – who greeted me.</span> <span id="s2591">And that was – I had to adjust my inner vision and my outer, and what I saw in reality.</span> <span id="s2592">That took a little bit.</span> <span id="s2593">And it took a while for us to become comfortable with each other.</span> <span id="s2594">I will have to admit that.</span> <span id="s2595">I will have to admit that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">04:35:42</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: For you had gone from a child in a way, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2599">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2600">And you see he didn't really know what we went through.</span> <span id="s2601">He had his own struggles.</span> <span id="s2602">It's not that he had a bed of roses.</span> <span id="s2603">He came up from nothing, and he had great sorrow to try to get us over.</span> <span id="s2604">I have seen his notes after his death, that he never showed me actually.</span> <span id="s2605">But I saw how he went from “Pontius to Pilate,” from one person to the other, begging for help – and nobody helped him.</span> <span id="s2606">And that wasn't easy either.</span> <span id="s2607">That couldn't have been an easy task either – and knowing that his family....</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: And what did he end up doing in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: He remained a butcher.</span> <span id="s2610">Remember he had no real education.</span> <span id="s2611">He first worked for some other Jewish kosher butchers in Washington Heights in New York, and then he and his brother opened their own little butcher shop – Schild Brothers – and they became quite successful, but always within the German Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2612">And you see his fear of anyone non- Jewish also never left him.</span> <span id="s2613">He also carried the scar even though he didn't go through the worst.</span> <span id="s2614">But he told me once when somebody came into the store that spoke English, they immediately were afraid.</span> <span id="s2615">They immediately thought it was someone to inspect the store, or to make trouble, or to want something from them.</span> <span id="s2616">You see, we all, we all have our scars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">You can't go through this without scars – you just can't.</span> <span id="s2618">So he was always afraid of anyone not Jewish as well.</span> <span id="s2619">Those were the enemies.</span> <span id="s2620">But he lived to a ripe old age.</span> <span id="s2621">He married again – a woman who was in Theresienstadt and lost her husband and two children there.</span> <span id="s2622">I never knew her there – I couldn't, it was much too big to know people.</span> <span id="s2623">We were so restricted and then she was much older.</span> <span id="s2624">I didn't readily associate or become friendly with people of my parents' age.</span> <span id="s2625">I stayed very much with my own age, and possibly with the very old people that I went to visit.</span> <span id="s2626">But I never knew her, and she was very good to him ‘til the day he died.</span> <span id="s2627">And he only died about nine years ago at the age of 92.</span> <span id="s2628">He remained very religious.</span> <span id="s2629">We became very close too at the end.</span> <span id="s2630">He never spoke – I always thought he would say something, at least on his deathbed still, that he shouldn't have left us, or something like that, but he never did.</span> <span id="s2631">This is another thing I, I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">04:38:54</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: Did you talk together about what had happened?</span> <span id="s2634">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: Hardly ever.</span> <span id="s2637">I won't say never, but hardly ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: And did he know what had happened to your mother and sister?</span> <span id="s2639">A: Barely.</span> <span id="s2640">Barely.</span> <span id="s2641">Barely.</span> <span id="s2642">I don't think he wanted to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: And did you live together for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">A: Yes, but very short, only – I married very soon after I came over.</span> <span id="s2645">I married within six months, and so those six months we, we – he roomed with a family.</span> <span id="s2646">After all he was completely alone.</span> <span id="s2647">And that family took me also in and gave me a room in the same latch apartment.</span> <span id="s2648">So we were together for a while.</span> <span id="s2649">But during that time we were not close, not at all.</span> <span id="s2650">I could not find a way to him, and he, he was obviously guilt ridden too.</span> <span id="s2651">He never really asked.</span> <span id="s2652">Then toward the very end he gave me my mother's letters, and then, then he was already mellowed, and he gave me my sister's letters, and my own letters.</span> <span id="s2653">And then he gave me also the letters that I wrote to him from Switzerland, so I have a huge bunch of letters which, which are very, very, very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">04:40:17</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: The last question, maybe – or the penultimate question.</span> <span id="s2656">You said that after you became – after you were depressed and went to a therapist, and then was better, or well–</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: By a psychiatrist, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2659">That you decided that you had to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2661">Yes, I decided– Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: Well, two things – one egotistical and the other altruistic.</span> <span id="s2663">The egotistical first.</span> <span id="s2664">I got myself an education.</span> <span id="s2665">I went to college.</span> <span id="s2666">My husband, my husband was always very understanding of me.</span> <span id="s2667">He could see, he could see my whole situation much better than I could.</span> <span id="s2668">And by then – this took a while.</span> <span id="s2669">My first depression occurred after my first baby was born.</span> <span id="s2670">And then I still was very timid, very much afraid of authority, very much reluctant to approach anyone that was in authority ‘cause that was dangerous up ‘til then.</span> <span id="s2671">So then after a while I missed very much that I didn't have an education.</span> <span id="s2672">And after a while then I went to Bates College in Lewiston, and they accepted me as one of the very first non-College age students.</span> <span id="s2673">See now, this is different.</span> <span id="s2674">This was in the ‘50s – in the ‘60s.</span> <span id="s2675">I graduated in ‘71.</span> <span id="s2676">I was only the second person of non– of not eighteen years old.</span> <span id="s2677">I was like 46 or 47, and I did alright.</span> <span id="s2678">I graduated with a lot of honors and I loved every moment of it.</span> <span id="s2679">And then I was done.</span> <span id="s2680">And then I didn't know what to do again, so my husband urged me and he said, "Go to graduate school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Become a librarian," ‘cause I liked books.</span> <span id="s2682">And I did that and again I graduated, so now what?</span> <span id="s2683">So he said, "Take a job.</span> <span id="s2684">Be a librarian."</span> <span id="s2685">And Bates College took me as a librarian, and I was very happy there during the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">04:42:22 And then the second part comes in – the altruistic part if I may say so.</span> <span id="s2687">Then I began to realize Bates College, up to not too long ago, was a very Baptist college.</span> <span id="s2688">When my husband became college physician in – soon after our marriage, in the early ‘50s, he was only the second Jewish employee of that whole college, and the college was in existence for some 150 years or so – and very limited Jewish students and no Jewish activities.</span> <span id="s2689">And they didn't know Jews or Jewish contexts or nothing about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2690">So an opportunity presented itself, ready made, and I stepped in.</span> <span id="s2691">I got myself funding from the National Humanities Counsel, and from Jewish organizations, and I began to educate the College.</span> <span id="s2692">I did programs of Jewish contexts, and I made month-long informational college affairs where the people could hear speeches and ask questions, have dialogues, and simply inform themselves, "What is Judaism?</span> <span id="s2693">What are Jews?</span> <span id="s2694">What are the finer points of it?"</span> <span id="s2695">And really, I was quite successful.</span> <span id="s2696">I got a Jewish library into the college, when the Rabbi of the city where I lived died.</span> <span id="s2697">This was all back in Maine.</span> <span id="s2698">We settled in Maine.</span> <span id="s2699">When he died I was instrumental in getting his whole library into the College, and it's known now as the Rabbi Barrend(ph) Jewish Library, and it's a fine, fine library.</span> <span id="s2700">I catalogued it, and integrated it as a special library.</span> <span id="s2701">And that drew Jewish interest.</span> <span id="s2702">And from that library – I used that again as my platform – I gave Jewish talks, and got Jewish persons in.</span> <span id="s2703">I had Hilberg.I had Lanskyof the Yiddish Center.</span> <span id="s2704">I had Velvel Pasternak of Jewish music.</span> <span id="s2705">I – who me?</span> <span id="s2706">I brought all these</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">92 Raul Hilberg</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">93 Aaron Lansky people in and I educated them.</span> <span id="s2709">Then finally I saw a need – the people wanted to teach the Holocaust and they didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s2710">They didn't know how to teach it.</span> <span id="s2711">So out of that activity, out of all those Jewish affairs that I had organized, was some money left over in the end, and I organized the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine for the purpose of helping the teachers teach the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2712">And that was a very fine success.</span> <span id="s2713">I moved out of Maine, but the Center stayed, and we have an oral history project, of course.</span> <span id="s2714">We have a teachers' guidebook.</span> <span id="s2715">We have all kinds of things, were successful.</span> <span id="s2716">And then I felt better.</span> <span id="s2717">I don't have a – I still feel terrible about my losses, but I don't feel guilty anymore.</span> <span id="s2718">And I speak all around the country.</span> <span id="s2719">And I hear students – I see there is a necessity to speak, because the students know only democracy.</span> <span id="s2720">The constant question is, "Well, why didn't you just not go," you know.</span> <span id="s2721">Or, "Why didn't you say you weren't Jewish?"</span> <span id="s2722">Or, "How come you had to give your house up?"</span> <span id="s2723">They don't understand this.</span> <span id="s2724">They're living in a democracy.</span> <span id="s2725">They don't understand what it is to live in an autocracy.</span> <span id="s2726">So I still – I still feel a need to talk and to write, and to answer questions.</span> <span id="s2727">And I wrote a second book, and I'm writing one now for even younger children, because they need to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">04:46:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to, to say, that you haven't said?</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">A: I'm exhausted.</span> <span id="s2731">That's what I'd like to say.</span> <span id="s2732">You were a great interviewer, but you got all the things out of me that were long buried, and that had to come up again, and had to be talked about.</span> <span id="s2733">My life is a patchwork.</span> <span id="s2734">But the nice thing is that the good parts are the quilted ones.</span> <span id="s2735">And the not good parts, they just are there.</span> <span id="s2736">They just are there, but….</span> <span id="s2737">I still have nightmares.</span> <span id="s2738">I still, I still have nightmares today, but during the day I'm a very happy person.</span> <span id="s2739">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: That's it.</span> <span id="s2742">I'll refer them to you.</span> <span id="s2743">04:47:33</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">Q: What are we seeing here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: That's Ansbach.</span> <span id="s2746">That's the house I was born in – Turnitzstrasse fünfand behind those windows on the left hand side was the bedroom.</span> <span id="s2747">And in the front here on the right hand side of the door was my father's butcher shop.</span> <span id="s2748">Nice.</span> <span id="s2749">My mother and my father in happy times walking away there.</span> <span id="s2750">I think that's in Ansbach – near our house.</span> <span id="s2751">It's not in front of our house.</span> <span id="s2752">Siegfried and Paula Schild – very clear.</span> <span id="s2753">Oh, that's a picture in Ansbach in our back yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">That's my grandmother Sophie on the one side, and my Aunt Berta and a cousin visiting.</span> <span id="s2755">And that's in the, in the yard where the chickens ran around, and the very background there, that was my father's sausage room where he made the sausage.</span> <span id="s2756">And on the side, I think that</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">94 Five (German) was our compost heap, if I'm not mistaken.</span> <span id="s2758">That was very rural, but happy times.</span> <span id="s2759">That was still in grade school though.</span> <span id="s2760">That's a class picture still in grade school – still happy.</span> <span id="s2761">I'm the one with the pigtails on the top row, fourth from the right, skinny little gal – and still quite happy.</span> <span id="s2762">That must have been.</span> <span id="s2763">… How old could I have been there?</span> <span id="s2764">Eight or nine?</span> <span id="s2765">Oh, then we're already 16 or so – no, not quite.</span> <span id="s2766">I'm not on that picture.</span> <span id="s2767">My sister Friedl is the one on the right hand side with the short hair; one of the few pictures I have of her.</span> <span id="s2768">Of that whole group only two survived, and I'm still friendly with them.</span> <span id="s2769">And my poor sister was, of course, one of the victims.</span> <span id="s2770">Yep, that's my sister Friedl.</span> <span id="s2771">Yes, that was the youth group we had, always clustered around our beloved Rabbi, Eli Munk, and his wife there with the shaytel on, on his right, and on the right of Mrs. Munk is my sister Friedl – there, there she is.</span> <span id="s2772">That's Friedl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">And I'm there too.</span> <span id="s2774">I'm in back between Mrs. Munk and Friedl, with the pigtails, and those were such happy times.</span> <span id="s2775">It was probably Shabbos afternoon when we were singing zmiros and he was telling us stories, and those were such happy times.</span> <span id="s2776">Most everybody else is gone in that picture, but it was the same.</span> <span id="s2777">And that's Elie Munk again in the back, and all the boys – probably having another session with him and Mrs. Munk.</span> <span id="s2778">And that was our Hebrew teacher that fellow in the back.</span> <span id="s2779">Ya, and that's our group.</span> <span id="s2780">How pretty she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">04:50:59</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: Can you point out your sister and yourself?</span> <span id="s2783">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: Can you point out your sister and yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s2786">My sister is the one on the right hand side.</span> <span id="s2787">Her friend has her arm around her.</span> <span id="s2788">You can see the hand.</span> <span id="s2789">And in front of that same friend, that's me.</span> <span id="s2790">Huh?</span> <span id="s2791">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2792">That was a Purim play.</span> <span id="s2793">I think we were a farmer and his wife or something like that.</span> <span id="s2794">That's in our back yard.</span> <span id="s2795">And the background is simply my mother's bedspreads hung up there with clothespins – to keep out all the rest of the back yard.</span> <span id="s2796">And that's my sister and me, Friedl and Gerda Schild.</span> <span id="s2797">My grandmother Sophie Jochsberger – a very dear woman.</span> <span id="s2798">She looms large in my memory – always kind – always time for me.</span> <span id="s2799">A very sweet person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: When did she die?</span> <span id="s2801">04:52:00</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">A: She died, thank God, she still died a normal death with her daughter in Regensburg, the one we saw before.</span> <span id="s2803">And she's buried in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s2804">It was 19– about – no, later than that – about 1939, before the transportations.</span> <span id="s2805">Oh, another picture from my happy youth, also in our back yard, the smokestack between Friedl and me is where my father smoked all the sausages, and on my left shoulder there, that's my father's grinding stone.</span> <span id="s2806">He sharpened up</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">95 Songs (Hebrew) his butcher knives there.</span> <span id="s2808">I can still see that, and that's really the chicken yard right there – the chicken house – in back of the grindstone – and my mother's laundry hanging there – and Friedl and I just hanging out, as they would say now... Just being happy.</span> <span id="s2809">Too bad she had to – she couldn't have a life.</span> <span id="s2810">That's a much photographed back yard, I'm telling you.</span> <span id="s2811">You can see a typical Fachwerkhaushouse in the back there.</span> <span id="s2812">There's my father, and Friedl and I, and my cousin Edith, the same one that was in the picture before – a very sweet little girl.</span> <span id="s2813">She came to us for summer vacations every year, and we always were happy together.</span> <span id="s2814">Ah, another picture of my happy youth.</span> <span id="s2815">That was an outing with the whole group.</span> <span id="s2816">It was called the JJA; the Jewish Youth Group of Ansbach.</span> <span id="s2817">And that's Friedl, the very – the white figure on the right hand side – on the very right.</span> <span id="s2818">And that's me, the second from the left.</span> <span id="s2819">There I'm already a tall girl.</span> <span id="s2820">Also, I was the younger one.</span> <span id="s2821">I very soon was taller than Friedl as you can already see here.</span> <span id="s2822">I've already surpassed her in height, and probably also in width, and she never held it against me.</span> <span id="s2823">She was much too good-natured for that.</span> <span id="s2824">And the rest of the gang, I remember them all.</span> <span id="s2825">Very few of them are still alive, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s2826">Friedl and I – just little pictures that somebody snapped.</span> <span id="s2827">I'm on the top of the frame, and she's on the bottom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">04:54:35</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">Q: Do you have any idea when this – these photos were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">A: I would say that was taken in Munich, just before we left for nurses training.</span> <span id="s2831">It's very possible that those were our official pictures to get into nursing training.</span> <span id="s2832">Ya, that's me with my nurse's uniform on.</span> <span id="s2833">I was so proud of it.</span> <span id="s2834">It was probably the first picture I sent back when I got to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">Q: So that's 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">A: 1940, exactly.</span> <span id="s2837">That was a picture that I had taken once I was liberated into Switzerland, and I took care of that little boy.</span> <span id="s2838">I'm still in tact with – in contact with his family.</span> <span id="s2839">Of course he's now a 50 year old man, and I took care of him for a while.</span> <span id="s2840">That's the Jewish star I was attached to from September, 1941 to February 12, 1945, when I ripped it off in the train that took me to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2841">And you can see then I didn't take care anymore of it.</span> <span id="s2842">Up to then, I had to be very careful with it.</span> <span id="s2843">If it looked like that, if I had worn it, I could have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">But once I ripped it off in Switzerland, I didn't care anymore what it looked like, and you can see the writing on it is simulated Hebrew lettering.</span> <span id="s2845">It's so evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">Q: And it's about, what do you think – two and a half – next to a pencil – maybe two and a half inches?</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">A: It was still the size of the – of the palm of your hand.</span> <span id="s2848">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">96 Framework house (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">04:56:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">A: Yes, that was my Theresienstadt box.</span> <span id="s2852">That was given to me on my birthday by one of my friends who worked in – who probably worked in a woodcarving factory or something.</span> <span id="s2853">It had a cover at one time, which I have long lost.</span> <span id="s2854">It's made of wood, and lined with some paper, and on the back of it, it says, "Ghetto Theresienstadt," and the date of my birth – "23rd of November, 19–" well, that was in ‘43 – 23rd of November is my birthday, and it was given to me on my 21st birthday – 1943.</span> <span id="s2855">I was born in 22.</span> <span id="s2856">And that was my birthday gift, and I treasured it ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">Q: Was this Jirca who gave you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2859">I'm not altogether sure anymore who gave it to me.</span> <span id="s2860">I think it was Jirca.</span> <span id="s2861">He was my most fervent, and I think my sole admirer in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2862">He swore that as soon as he would come back from the Osttransport he would find me, and then he wanted to marry me, but I think deep down we both knew that he would never come back.</span> <span id="s2863">Now what you're seeing here is my permission to be a nurse in the Ghetto of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2864">It says here, "Gerda Schild," and there is my ghetto number – the name meant nothing, the number was everything – and Ubikation, that meant where I lived.</span> <span id="s2865">I was in C-3.</span> <span id="s2866">That was still in the Hamburger Kaserne, and it says here that I can now work as a nurse, and am permitted to wear a uniform, and it was signed by Erich Munk – he was the health officer there – and dated as well.</span> <span id="s2867">And my place of work was going to be Q 721.</span> <span id="s2868">That was later renamed Bergstrasse seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: Can you just explain the lettering.</span> <span id="s2870">It was Q, and there was another letter–</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A: Q and L. Originally the whole Theresienstadt was divided into Q streets which went one way, and L..</span> <span id="s2872">.</span> <span id="s2873">Q meant queer – Queer and Long – and the others were longitude – Longitude and Queer, and Q and L, that was all there was.</span> <span id="s2874">But then when the Commission came, suddenly there appeared beautifully decorated little wooden signs on each street with fancy names – Bergstrasse and Wiesenstrasse(ph), and what have you, and Q was 7 – was then Bergstrasse 7.</span> <span id="s2875">And this is my permission to go into the Swiss transport with my number 1,174 on the right hand corner, and it tells me not to bring any ugly bedrolls – just to bring a neat suitcase and be gone.</span> <span id="s2876">Oh, that's finally a picture of my family.</span> <span id="s2877">I defied Hitler and started a family and brought new Jews into the world.</span> <span id="s2878">My husband and I, and those are my four children.</span> <span id="s2879">Polly was probably – 12 then.</span> <span id="s2880">She's the one that later married Jean.</span> <span id="s2881">And that's Lenwho's now in Utah, and Hedy,who is in Minneapolis – She's the reason we moved there, and that's Davidwho just had a baby here in Washington.</span> <span id="s2882">What a lovely group of kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">97 Len Haas</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">98 Hedy Haas-David</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">99 David Haas</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: And Polly's on the far left behind you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s2888">That's our Polly.</span> <span id="s2889">That was in Maine approximately 1965, I would guess.</span> <span id="s2890">And after I brought up the children and defied Hitler one way, I went ahead and defied him again and told the story of my life, and other people's lives, and the history of the Holocaust in two books.</span> <span id="s2891">This is the second book, and I'm still writing now another third book.</span> <span id="s2892">And this is just coming out by Lerner Brothersin Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s2893">I'm pretty proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">05:01:03 End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview 100 Lerner Group Publishing</span></p></body></html>
