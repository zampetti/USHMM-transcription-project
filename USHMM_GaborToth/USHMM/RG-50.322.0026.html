Project.</span></p> <p><span id="s2">JO: This is an interview with Ben Muler by Julie Orenstein.</span> <span id="s3">It is August 21, 1984.</span> <span id="s4">We are in the kitchen of his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">BEN: My name is Benjamin Muler.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">JO: What is your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">BEN: My age is 62.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">JO: What city were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">BEN: I was born in Vilna, Poland (it is possible that there is a lack of understanding there since Vilna or Wilno, as it was known pre WWII, is today known as Vilnius, and is a city of 196,000 inhabitants, and is the capital of Lithuanian SSR, i.e., a part of Russia.</span> <span id="s11">Vilna or Wilno was a part of Poland between 1919 and 1939...no other city of this size seems to fill the bill.</span> <span id="s12">It is located at 54.41N,25.19E).</span></p> <p><span id="s13">JO: Did you grow up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">BEN: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s15">JO: What kind of a town was it?</span> <span id="s16">Was it a small town or large town?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">BEN: It was quite a large city.</span> <span id="s18">The population was about 180,000.</span> <span id="s19">About half of that population was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">JO: Was it a manufacturing town?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">BEN: It was similar to Dayton, manufacturing and business.</span> <span id="s22">Middle class type.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">JO: Do you know why and how your family came to be in Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">BEN: I believe that they lived there all their lives.</span> <span id="s25">As far as I can remember, my grandfather and grandmother were from Vilna and my mother, if I am not mistaken, her parents lived closeby in a suburb.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">JO: So they pretty much have been there for generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">BEN: Yes, for generations.</span> <span id="s28">That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">JO: Do you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">BEN: I have one sister, who is in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">JO: Is she younger or older?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">BEN: One year older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">JO: What did your grandparents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">BEN: I never knew my grandparents from my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s35">However, as far as I can remember, my grandmother always stayed with us because her husband, my grandfather, passed away before I was born.</span> <span id="s36">I don’t know much about how they earned their living.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">JO: What did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">BEN: My father was a printer.</span> <span id="s39">He and some other friends of his were in a club and published a newspaper in Vilna.</span> <span id="s40">Before the newspaper, they worked in a printing shop where they published religious books, that is, Jewish religious books.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">JO: Did your mother ever work?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">BEN: She had a store of office supplies.</span> <span id="s43">She started that before she even got married.</span> <span id="s44">She had that store until the war broke out, until the 1st day of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">JO: Was it common for a woman to have her own business?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">BEN: Not as far as I can remember, not too often, however, a few women on our street had them.</span> <span id="s47">I don’t know if one limited the other, or what happened, but there were a few women who conducted businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">JO: What kind of education did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">BEN: I would say that they probably only had public education, which amounted to 6th or 7th grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">JO: So, they didn’t go out and get any specialized education?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">BEN: No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">JO: Were they very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">BEN: Not very much so.</span> <span id="s54">They just observed the Holy days, then they went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s55">But they didn’t go that often through the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">JO: Did they keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">BEN: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s58">JO: Were you Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">BEN: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s60">I had a beautiful Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">JO: What was the language spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">BEN: Our parents spoke Yiddish to us.</span> <span id="s63">However, once in a while, when people came into our home, they used to speak Polish or Russian.</span> <span id="s64">It depended who the people were.</span> <span id="s65">There were Polish neighbors.</span> <span id="s66">When they came into the house, we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s67">If people...sophisticated people came in, they spoke Russian, because my hometown of Vilna went many times back and forth often between Poland, Russia and Lithuania The town, originally was the capital of Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">JO: So, were your parents part of the “intelligentsia” (that is the word used in lieu of sophisticated people)?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">BEN: I would not say that they were “intelligentsia,” but they were quite intelligent people, and they had friends who were well educated.</span> <span id="s70">Since my father was a printer, and this was considered quite an accomplishment, quite a nice profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">JO: Did you understand all of these languages?</span> <span id="s72">Do you also speak Polish and Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s74">I did not speak Russian, but I could understand it.</span> <span id="s75">However, we learned Polish in school.</span> <span id="s76">We went to a government school, so the main language was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">JO: Did you live pretty much in a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">BEN: Our neighborhood was not strictly Jewish.</span> <span id="s79">It contained all kinds of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">JO: Did your father make a pretty good living as a printer?</span> <span id="s81">Would you say that he was wealthy, or belonged to the middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">BEN: I wouldn’t say that they were wealthy, but they were good middle class.</span> <span id="s83">Between what both of my parents earned, we were able to live quite nicely, compared to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">JO: Did your parents have mostly Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">BEN: No, my mother had all kinds of friends.</span> <span id="s86">Polish people, especially neighbors from the building where we lived.</span> <span id="s87">It was a big building with 24 tenants, and she grew up in that building.</span> <span id="s88">So she had a lot of Polish (meaning Polish Christian) friends.</span> <span id="s89">They were quite nice to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JO: Did they socialize at the synagogue?</span> <span id="s91">Was the synagogue the social center?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">BEN: No.</span> <span id="s93">Perhaps for some people, but not for my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">JO: Were there any other associations in which your parents were involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">BEN: My father was a member of a union, the printer’s union.</span> <span id="s96">My mother belonged to the small business association, similar to the Chamber of Commerce here.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">JO: Do you remember anything about their political activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">BEN: As far as I can remember, they were both quite democratic.</span> <span id="s99">They always tried to help people.</span> <span id="s100">I think being democratic is the word for them.</span> <span id="s101">(In May, 1926, Marshal Pilsudski seized power in Poland after a 2 day military revolt.</span> <span id="s102">He made himself dictator.</span> <span id="s103">A new constitution was adopted in 1935, shortly before Pilsudski’s death to preserve the dictatorship.</span> <span id="s104">Marshal Smigly-Rydz, Josef Beck, and some of Pilsudski’s colonels retained absolute rule.)</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JO: What kind of things did they do to help people?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">BEN: We had a big family.</span> <span id="s107">On my mother’s side, there were a lot of sisters, my aunts, also nieces and nephews and there were also relatives on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s108">They were not, so to say, as successful as my parents were.</span> <span id="s109">My mother was like a mother to all of them.</span> <span id="s110">She tried to help everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">JO: Did any of them live in your home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">BEN: Just my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">JO: Did your parents enjoy going to the theatre?</span> <span id="s114">To the Opera?</span> <span id="s115">Or that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">BEN: Yes, that was the main enjoyment they had - the theatre and the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JO: Did they take you and your sister along?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">BEN: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s119">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s120">JO: How would you describe your childhood?</span> <span id="s121">Let’s say, do you have any memory prior to going to school?</span> <span id="s122">Of what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">BEN: As I said earlier, we were middle class.</span> <span id="s124">Still, I had more opportunities than other kids my age, since my mother tried to give me everything which it was in her power to give, in order to make me happy.</span> <span id="s125">I enjoyed participating in sports.</span> <span id="s126">If I wanted an ice cream or to go somewhere, I was always able to get the necessary pennies to enjoy myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">JO: Do you remember any special events from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">BEN: Once, when I got a beating from my father.</span> <span id="s129">But, seriously, when I was younger, we stuck together and those were pleasant memories.</span> <span id="s130">We did things such as going for hikes or bike rides or canoeing.</span> <span id="s131">Instead of the 3 musketeers, who were actually four, we were five.</span> <span id="s132">We always did things together.</span> <span id="s133">I also was very sports-oriented.</span> <span id="s134">Furthermore, ever since I was young, I was always interested in world politics.</span> <span id="s135">I always listened to the radio including foreign stations which I could get on my short-wave radio.</span> <span id="s136">I always liked to know what was going on in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">JO: You said that you went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">BEN: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">JO: How many years did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">BEN: I finished public school, which took 7 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">JO: What percent of your class was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">BEN: 100% This was a public school set up by the Polish government especially for Jewish kids; however, the main language used was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">JO: Were you separated for reasons of anti-semitism?</span> <span id="s144">Or did you feel that that was the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">BEN: At that time, none of the parents would send small kids to an integrated school.</span> <span id="s146">That would have caused a lot of trouble, just a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s147">This was the reason why they made “separate” schools</span></p> <p><span id="s148">JO: You keep saying Polish and Jewish, still your family was from Vilna.</span> <span id="s149">Was there a feeling that you were not really Polish?</span> <span id="s150">Since you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">BEN: We felt as if we were citizens of Poland, I don’t believe that we did anything which warranted us being persecuted.</span> <span id="s152">However, there were all kinds of restrictions on us.</span> <span id="s153">We had to suffer through pogroms.</span> <span id="s154">There were incidents by students from the university who used to go into the predominantly Jewish sections and start riots, including breaking windows and beating people.</span> <span id="s155">For these reasons, we always had to live in some kind of fear that something might happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JO: Did these things happen often?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">BEN: When the head of the state was Josef Pilsudski, today you would say that he was a dictator, he had been the chief of the army, that was until 1933 that he ruled, it was quiet in Poland.</span> <span id="s158">During his dictatorship, there were not too many excesses, such as pogroms or the like.</span> <span id="s159">He had a strong feeling about the Jews, since the Jews had helped him come to power.</span> <span id="s160">The Jews also helped him take the area of Vilna from Russia for Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">JO: When did he come to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">BEN: He came to power in 1920 (actually the World Book Encyclopedia says 1926, that was probably when he formally took the power into his hands) after WWI.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">JO: So, within your memory, there weren’t many pogroms?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">BEN: No, there were pogroms after he passed away, from 1934 to the war in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">JO: What kind of anti-semitic activities were perpetrated against you personally?</span> <span id="s166">Were you bothered after school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">BEN: It was if I went to town with my friends and we met 3 or 4 Polish boys walking in the street, they started a fight.</span> <span id="s168">They would start beating us up.</span> <span id="s169">The outcome of course, depended on who was stronger.</span> <span id="s170">However, a fight started and they called us all kinds of names.</span> <span id="s171">We weren’t going to go out to start a fight, but we didn’t run away either.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">JO: Were there restrictions imposed on Jews by the government itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">BEN: Yes, they were mostly, imposed by the government.</span> <span id="s174">Let me explain what the restrictions were: if my father published the paper, he could not state in it if somebody got beaten up, because the government didn’t want it known.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">JO: So you had a censorship.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">BEN: Yes, everyday before the paper could be put on the street, the paper had to be presented to the censor, and he reviewed everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">JO: Did you have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">BEN: No, very few.</span> <span id="s179">Neighbors from our street.</span> <span id="s180">While we are talking about excesses and pogroms.</span> <span id="s181">There was one big pogrom, in which many people (Jews) got hurt and I believe, several got killed.</span> <span id="s182">Talking about Polish neighbors, we had very good neighbors, including one man, who had a bakery next door to us.</span> <span id="s183">He was an older man, a very liberal, democratic man.</span> <span id="s184">I remember this today although I was a young boy.</span> <span id="s185">My father had to go to work at 7 a.m. and when the pogrom started, I remember this as if it had happened today, we heard a knock on the door at 6:30 a.m.</span> <span id="s186">We got kind of scared “who could that be?”</span> <span id="s187">We opened the door and there is the neighbor with 2 men.</span> <span id="s188">H said: “Mr. Muler,” to my father, “are you ready to go to work?”</span> <span id="s189">My father said “I will be ready in a few minutes.”</span> <span id="s190">The neighbor said “We will take you to work.</span> <span id="s191">We will be your bodyguards, so that nothing happens to you.”</span> <span id="s192">They took him to work and then at 3:30 p.m., they were at the door of the printing shop waiting to take him back home.</span> <span id="s193">This was most unusual.</span> <span id="s194">We certainly did appreciate something like that since at that time nobody when they left for work knew that they were coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">JO: How old were you in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">BEN: 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">JO: That is when things began to get worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">BEN: Yes, that is right!</span></p> <p><span id="s199">JO: You said that, when you were a boy, you listened to international radio via short-wave?</span> <span id="s200">What did you know about the NAZI movement, before 1933?</span> <span id="s201">Anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">BEN: The NAZI movement started in 1933 (that is not so...it assumed power in German in 1933.</span> <span id="s203">The attempted beer hall putsch had been in 1923).</span> <span id="s204">I didn’t know much.</span> <span id="s205">However, in 1934, when I finished school, I went to work for my father in the printing shop.</span> <span id="s206">I was going to learn the trade.</span> <span id="s207">I remember that every time I went into the shop, the editor used to listen to short-wave radio from Germany, and listened to the speeches which Hitler made.</span> <span id="s208">They always announced, in advance, that Hitler was going to speak.</span> <span id="s209">When the editor used to listen to the speeches, I used to sit next to him and listen.</span> <span id="s210">Later on I bought a radio for my own use.</span> <span id="s211">Then I listened at home, mainly Germany or Russia or from Warsaw, Poland.</span> <span id="s212">I used to listen to the news about what was going on.</span> <span id="s213">In later years, I started listening to English broadcasting from BBC (British Broadcasting System).</span></p> <p><span id="s214">JO: When did you first hear about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">BEN: After I got out of school and started going to work.</span> <span id="s216">This was the time when everybody was aggravated and worried.</span> <span id="s217">Then, the name Hitler came up more often.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">JO: What kind of aggravations were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">BEN: The very first year, when he came to power, and also just before that, we heard what was happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s220">I mean the Jews getting beaten up, stores being bombed, windows being broken, synagogues being burned.</span> <span id="s221">That kind of thing.</span> <span id="s222">We knew that things were happening there.</span> <span id="s223">We had been hoping that Hitler would never get to power in Germany.</span> <span id="s224">I seemed impossible that Germany would let a man like this come to power.</span> <span id="s225">However, as soon as it happened, and he got elected (by the Bundestag, i.e., the German Congress, we knew that there would be problems.</span> <span id="s226">We didn’t know exactly what kind of problems there would be, but we knew that there would be trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">JO: Did you think then that he would make trouble for Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">BEN: No, we really didn’t know that he was going to make trouble for Poland or anywhere else, but we knew that there would be trouble for the Jews.</span> <span id="s229">He spoke openly about this as being his aim.</span> <span id="s230">It didn’t come out all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s231">He had been promising this all his life, at least his political life.</span> <span id="s232">He always had said what he was going to do.</span> <span id="s233">A lot of people didn’t take his word, but he always said it.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">JO: So you started working for your father in the print shop when you were twelve?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">BEN: I was actually 13, when I really worked, in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">JO: Was printing something you had wanted to do?</span> <span id="s237">Had you thought about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">BEN: I had not been a good student.</span> <span id="s239">Not good enough to go on to university, anyway.</span> <span id="s240">So my father said: “Well, since you don’t want to go and learn something in school, you are going to be a printer.”</span> <span id="s241">So I went into the shop and I picked it up really well.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">JO: How long did you work for your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">BEN: For about 2 years.</span> <span id="s244">This was a newspaper printing shop.</span> <span id="s245">My father did not want me to be just a newspaper printer.</span> <span id="s246">He also wanted me to learn the commercial side.</span> <span id="s247">So he found another printer who took me as an apprentice for the highest caliber of commercial work being done in that printing shop.</span> <span id="s248">He talked to the owner who took me on as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s249">So I served that apprenticeship for four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JO: Why did you leave that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">BEN: Oh, I didn’t leave that job.</span> <span id="s252">I stayed there until the end, until 1939.</span> <span id="s253">Then the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">JO: During that time, did you live with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">BEN: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">JO: What kind of a house did you have?</span> <span id="s257">Did you live in a house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">BEN: An apartment.</span> <span id="s259">As I told you earlier, it was a 24 unit apartment building in which we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">JO: What was the 1st thing which happened when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s261">What was the first personal experience which you had with the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">BEN: The first day of the war, we went on an outing into the forest out of town (that must have been Sept., 1939) with a boat.</span> <span id="s263">It was an outing in which quite a few people from the printers union participated.</span> <span id="s264">It was a picnic.</span> <span id="s265">We didn’t know anything about the war breaking out, we hadn’t even expected it.</span> <span id="s266">During that outing someone came from town and told us that Vilna had been bombed.</span> <span id="s267">Then everybody got panicky, and we tried to get back home.</span> <span id="s268">Home was about 15 Km (10 miles) away.</span> <span id="s269">So, we all started by foot or bicycle or whatever, to return to Vilna.</span> <span id="s270">When we got back to town, there were already some homes which had been destroyed, with some people having been killed.</span> <span id="s271">That is how we knew that the war had started.</span> <span id="s272">However, an announcement came out then that the Germans would not come into Vilna; that the Russians would come in instead.</span> <span id="s273">That was because they had a pact between Russia and Germany which divided Poland between the two.</span> <span id="s274">The Eastern part, including Vilna, was to go to the Russians and the Western part, including Warsaw, was to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s275">So we never saw the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">JO: So what happened when the Russians took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">BEN: When the Russians took over they nationalized all the businesses, so my mother closed her store right away.</span> <span id="s278">They nationalized all the printing shops because there are not private printing shops in Russia, and no private newspapers, and they combined all the printing shops of Vilna into a big publishing house.</span> <span id="s279">They took all the machinery from all the printers and they made one big plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">JO: Is that where you worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">BEN: That is where all the printers worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">JO: You said that was done in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">BEN: Yes, in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">JO: Your father worked there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">BEN: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s286">JO: However, your mother lost her business completely?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s288">She closed it up and that was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">JO: What was the Russian’s attitude toward Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">BEN: By that time they were receptive to Jews.</span> <span id="s291">They didn’t bother anybody.</span> <span id="s292">They acclaimed freedom for all the nationalities.</span> <span id="s293">They proclaimed that everybody is the same; that there was no difference between Russians (meaning inhabitants of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic whose capital as well as that of Russia proper, is Moscow) or Jews, or Cossacks, or any of the other nationalities.</span> <span id="s294">That was at least what they claimed.</span> <span id="s295">We didn’t have any problems when they came in.</span> <span id="s296">However, then after they were well established, they decided to play politics.</span> <span id="s297">Then they took Vilna, Vilnius, which had formerly been the capital of Lithuania and gave it to the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s298">When the Lithuanians came into Vilnius, they made it their capital again.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">JO: So the Russians pulled out?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">BEN: No, they didn’t pull out but they no longer participated in running the city.</span> <span id="s301">They just kept their army, and other military units in the area.</span> <span id="s302">The city administration was left to the Lithuanians.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">JO: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">BEN: That occurred as early as 1940.</span> <span id="s305">That was quickly done, but right after that they decided to take Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, and incorporate them into the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s306">It was like giving a child a piece of candy, but taking away the whole thing.</span> <span id="s307">They gave them the city, but took the whole country.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">JO: How did that change things for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">BEN: The Lithuanians, they were quite anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s310">We had problems with them.</span> <span id="s311">They started a big pogrom, still in 1940.</span> <span id="s312">It got so bad that the Jewish population had to turn to the Russians for help to stop it.</span> <span id="s313">It took intervention from the U.S. to put pressure on Russia to stop the riots in Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">JO: So there was rioting.</span> <span id="s315">Was that on numerous occasions?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">BEN: It lasted for several days.</span> <span id="s317">For several days there were big riots, Jewish people were beaten up, windows in stores were broken, stores were looted and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">JO: Do you know how the intervention of the U.S. was arranged?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">BEN: I believe that it was made through the Joint (Joint is short for Joint Distribution Committee, which is a division of the Jewish organization connected with resettling organization) and through the HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society).</span> <span id="s320">They made an appeal to the Jewish community in the U.S.</span> <span id="s321">They applied pressure to stop the pogrom.</span> <span id="s322">That was in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">JO: So the Russians finally stopped the riots?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">BEN: They intervened with soldiers and stopped the whole thing.</span> <span id="s325">Then they took over the whole country of Lithuania, including Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">JO: At this point your family was still all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">BEN: Yes, we were still together.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">JO: You still lived in the same apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">BEN: Yes, that was so.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">JO: Were there any acts of violence committed against you personally, or someone in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">BEN: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s332">JO: Your family left Vilna after a while.</span> <span id="s333">What caused that?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">BEN: When the war broke out between Germany and Russia in 1941, my sister and her husband had been taken to Russia in 1940, to Minsk.</span> <span id="s335">One of the largest industrial complexes in Vilna was a radio factory.</span> <span id="s336">When the Russians came into Vilna in 1940, the entire factory complex and all the workers who did work for that factory were moved to Minsk.</span> <span id="s337">Even today this factory in Minsk is one of the biggest radio factories in Russia.</span> <span id="s338">My sister didn’t want to go but the Russian Secret Service came to our house and they said plainly: “They have to go and if they won’t leave the house, we will come to get them.”</span> <span id="s339">So, they went to Russia, and the fact that they did go is a reason why my sister is alive.</span> <span id="s340">Her husband was taken into the Russian army, in the early days of the war, and he got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">JO: Was she the one working in the factory, or did both of them work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">BEN: He did!</span> <span id="s343">He worked, however, I believe that after a short period of time, she did also because, in Russia, if you don’t work, you don’t eat, no matter who it is, woman or man.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">JO: Now were they taken at gunpoint?</span> <span id="s345">Or did they go voluntarily: BEN: No, they were so to say, taken at gunpoint because they had to appear.</span> <span id="s346">You see, they didn’t want to go, but they made them go.</span> <span id="s347">Also at the same time, that was lucky for a lot of rich people in Vilna, that was the reason that some of them are alive, because, one night, it actually happened once or twice, in the middle of the night, they rounded up all the people who had businesses, including industrialists, and they took them deep into Russia as undesirables.</span> <span id="s348">These people, and they were mainly Jewish people, obviously there were also Poles, but the majority were Jews, first thought that it is a disaster, but it turned out to be great luck - it saved their lives, unwittingly, but still, it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">JO: When did you leave Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">BEN: I left Vilna on the 2nd day of the war between Germany and Russia.</span> <span id="s351">I felt at that time that there is too much trouble; that there was going to be too much trouble for young people.</span> <span id="s352">I was young and strong and I thought that, for me, it would be risky to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">JO: What kind of trouble did you expect?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">BEN: As a young man and as a Jew, I thought that they would take me to hard labor or such a thing.</span> <span id="s355">I didn’t know exactly, but the least I could expect was hard labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">JO: From the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">BEN: No, from the Germans!</span> <span id="s358">The Russians were there.</span> <span id="s359">I knew that the Russians could not withstand the war, at least the beginning of the war, because I had seen how they came in.</span> <span id="s360">They just simply weren’t prepared for it.</span> <span id="s361">(Between 1939 and 1941, the entire Russian army had been brought to a standstill by the very much LESS POWERFUL army of Finland.</span> <span id="s362">Russia had even had the element of surprise when they invaded Finland without declaration of war).</span> <span id="s363">I knew that there would be trouble.</span> <span id="s364">As a matter of fact, 10 young men and 1 girl from our street came to me early in the morning, 6 a.m. on that 2nd day of the war.</span> <span id="s365">They said: “Ben, we are leaving.</span> <span id="s366">If you are willing to go with us, we all will go together.”</span> <span id="s367">On the spur of the moment, they gave me one hour or so to pack all my belongings, clothes, underwear, etc., and my mother and father told me “You better go!”</span> <span id="s368">- I had to decide.</span> <span id="s369">I told them “I want you to come with me!”</span> <span id="s370">I could sense that it would be bad for all of the Jews.</span> <span id="s371">“Come with me.</span> <span id="s372">I will help you.</span> <span id="s373">I will do anything I can on the road.”</span> <span id="s374">You know that we had to walk.</span> <span id="s375">My mother said: “I am willing to go!”</span> <span id="s376">But my father was a short man and heavy set and he said: “How far can I go?</span> <span id="s377">I will stay!”</span> <span id="s378">So my mother said: “No, I won’t leave without him.</span> <span id="s379">However, you go.</span> <span id="s380">You go to your sister and in 3 or 4 days or a week, you can come back.”</span> <span id="s381">I said “It will take longer than that, and before I can come back, there will be a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s382">You better come with me.”</span> <span id="s383">They both decided that they wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s384">They winked and said: “We remember the Germans from WWI and we were able to do business with the Germans, and they weren’t that bad.”</span> <span id="s385">I told them that these were not the same Germans now, however, making a long story short, they didn’t go and I left with my friends.</span> <span id="s386">We walked from Vilna approximately 100 Km (60 miles) over the Russian border.</span> <span id="s387">On the way we already saw some Jewish men and women who had been ambushed on the way by the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s388">They had been killed by the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s389">They were ambushing people on the road out of Vilna, but because we were a larger group, we got through without problems.</span> <span id="s390">We arrived into Russia proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">JO: So, you had to go through the threat of ambush.</span> <span id="s392">Did you have any confrontations with anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">BEN: I won’t believe that you would call it confrontation, but we saw friends of ours dead on the highway, as a result of ambushes, on the sides of the road.</span> <span id="s394">I came to Minsk where my sister was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s395">However, when we arrived there, Minsk was burning.</span> <span id="s396">The Germans had been bombing very heavily.</span> <span id="s397">We saw the German planes bombing.</span> <span id="s398">They had set Minsk on fire by that time.</span> <span id="s399">Minsk had been a city of over 500,000 people; the largest city on the direct road from Warsaw to Moscow.</span> <span id="s400">I tried to reach people who were leaving Minsk and ask them if they knew anything of the whereabouts of my sister, or if they knew her.</span> <span id="s401">You know, I talked to some people and they told me that she has to be on one of the trucks which they used to evacuate the factory.</span> <span id="s402">Someone had seen her get aboard a truck.</span> <span id="s403">So I jumped from one truck to the other, and tried to reach her, however, I never could locate her.</span> <span id="s404">Then I went through close to the water, and I worked for a couple of months in a Koposk - that is a Russian communal farm community.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">JO: What kind of facilities did you have there?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">BEN: From the minute we crossed over into the Russia proper, we were always directed where to go.</span> <span id="s407">They sent all the people from the train, and they had put us on a train, and they sent us to that Koposk.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">JO: Were they Russian government officials who were directing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">BEN: Yes!</span> <span id="s410">Everything was organized.</span> <span id="s411">From then on there were always Russian officials who directed us where to go.</span> <span id="s412">We were not allowed to move by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">JO: Did you live in barracks at this farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s415">We didn’t have any clothes other than what we had on our backs.</span> <span id="s416">Whatever we had brought from home, we wore until it fell apart.</span> <span id="s417">When our shoes fell apart and became torn on the Koposk, they had no other shoes to give us.</span> <span id="s418">They said: Well, that is enough for that kind of work for you.”</span> <span id="s419">Also the Germans were coming closer, so they told us: “You better keep going further into Russia!</span> <span id="s420">To the Volga.</span> <span id="s421">Over there there are bigger cities, you are people from cities, you are not really farm people.”</span> <span id="s422">So they gave us a pass to move on.</span> <span id="s423">We came to the Volga.</span> <span id="s424">From there we boarded a boat.</span> <span id="s425">The boat took us upstream and we got to the Ural Mountains.</span> <span id="s426">That is where I wound up, near Sverdlovsk (that is a city of about 11/4 million people, located 56.51N,60.36E).</span> <span id="s427">I had a friend from Vilna who told me that at one time his sister lived in Sverdlovsk.</span> <span id="s428">This is a story by itself.</span> <span id="s429">People in Poland in 1932 thought that Russia is a paradise.</span> <span id="s430">For that reason a group of Jewish people, husbands and wives, crossed the border into Russia.</span> <span id="s431">We are talking about 35 families.</span> <span id="s432">When they crossed the border they got arrested.</span> <span id="s433">They said: “We don’t need more Communists here, we need more Communists outside of our borders!”</span> <span id="s434">They arrested them all and shipped them to the Ural Mountains.</span> <span id="s435">After they were there for about 1 month, they took the husbands away and they let the women stay by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">JO: That was done by the Russian government?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">BEN: Yes, I was there for 4 years and that had happened nearly 10 years earlier.</span> <span id="s438">We never could find out what happened to the husbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">JO: So the women were there all by themselves!</span></p> <p><span id="s440">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s441">That is right.</span> <span id="s442">However, they all had jobs, clothes and food.</span> <span id="s443">They just didn’t have their husbands, but otherwise they didn’t bother them.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">JO: What kind of a community was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">BEN: It was an industrial community.</span> <span id="s446">Heavy industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">JO: Was it a large community?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">BEN: No, this was a small town.</span> <span id="s449">I would say that it had about 15 thousand to 20 thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">JO: Had these women been living together pretty much?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">BEN: No.</span> <span id="s452">Each one had an apartment, or at least a room for herself.</span> <span id="s453">Over there they really don’t have apartments like here.</span> <span id="s454">You generally had one room and one kitchen for 2 - 3 families, and a bathroom for 20 families.</span> <span id="s455">That is the standard over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">JO: So you came there on a boat in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">BEN: In 1941, yes.</span> <span id="s458">That was at the end, taking the boat and all that and then train and truck.</span> <span id="s459">It wasn’t all done by boat, since the boat does not go up the Ural Mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">JO: Why did you decide to stop there?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">BEN: The reason I went there is that my friend had told me years earlier that he had a sister there.</span> <span id="s462">So I figured that I go there and see what is happening.</span> <span id="s463">As a matter of fact, when I got there I found my friend there at his sister’s.</span> <span id="s464">We went together to work in the same factory and we lived together with a Russian family, because it was very hard to get an apartment, even apartments as I described earlier.</span> <span id="s465">So we found a Russian family which was willing to take us in.</span> <span id="s466">We paid them some money from our wages.</span> <span id="s467">These wages were meager, but it helped them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">JO: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">BEN: I worked in a steel mill!</span> <span id="s470">We were making steel pipes.</span> <span id="s471">I worked there for about one month.</span> <span id="s472">I had a bad experience there.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">JO: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">BEN: On the 1st day I worked there and on the 2nd day when I came to work, another fellow and myself were supposed to take red hot steel pipes away from the furnaces with tongs.</span> <span id="s475">Each pipe weighed about 200 kg., which is about 440 lbs.</span> <span id="s476">We were to take them up and set them on the side.</span> <span id="s477">The fellow who was working with me on that was a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s478">One time, while we were working, and we picked up with the tongs, he let go of his side of the pipe while calling out to me: “Here Jew, you will break your legs!”</span> <span id="s479">He figured that the pipe would get on my legs, and they would be smashed.</span> <span id="s480">Naturally, I let my end of the pipe go, and I just picked up the tongs which I had in my hands and hit him right over the head.</span> <span id="s481">Then the Russians came, the people came, and they asked what had happened.</span> <span id="s482">I told them exactly what had happened.</span> <span id="s483">They took him away and I never heard any more from him, or about him.</span> <span id="s484">I worked there for about one month and then they drafted me into the Russian labor force.</span> <span id="s485">It is like an army, as far as draft goes, but it was only to work, it was not to go to the front lines.</span> <span id="s486">They sent us to another small town about 40 km (25 miles) from there.</span> <span id="s487">That was in a forest where we cut down timber for the copper mines.</span> <span id="s488">Right next to the forest were the copper mines.</span> <span id="s489">These mines needed the timber so that they would not cave in.</span> <span id="s490">We had to cut the trees.</span> <span id="s491">They were so big that if 3 people would hold hands, they could not encircle one tree.</span> <span id="s492">These trees must have been hundreds of years old.</span> <span id="s493">We worked there for a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">JO: What was your living arrangement there?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">BEN: We lived in barracks, regular army barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">JO: How many people were there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">BEN: We were 6 - 7 to a room.</span> <span id="s498">There were maybe 1000 people or so working in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">JO: That was a big group.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">BEN: Yes, it was a large group of people over there.</span> <span id="s501">There were army officers in charge.</span> <span id="s502">We worked in the forest and, after that, they took us away from there and got us to build a copper mill, in which copper was to be melted.</span> <span id="s503">They picked me to work on one of the furnaces.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">JO: Was that in another place?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">BEN: It was close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">JO: What was the living arrangement there?</span> <span id="s507">Were they also barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">BEN: Yes, that is right!</span></p> <p><span id="s509">JO: Were there only men?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">BEN: Yes, men.</span> <span id="s511">Only men.</span> <span id="s512">Then they transferred us to a small town, which was closest to the factory - the copper mill.</span> <span id="s513">The living arrangements were a little different.</span> <span id="s514">They were not barracks as it had been in the woods.</span> <span id="s515">These were apartments where 2 fellows lived together, or maybe 3 fellows, depending on the rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">JO: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">BEN: From 1941 until 1946, in the same place.</span> <span id="s518">We were there permanently.</span> <span id="s519">They did not take us in the army because we were needed to work on the copper mill.</span> <span id="s520">Our jobs were such that they had no replacement for us.</span> <span id="s521">After a little while we all got specialized in our particular jobs.</span> <span id="s522">It got to be routine work.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">JO: While you were there did you have any kind of social life?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s525">We were together with people from Poland, or people from Germany.</span> <span id="s526">Or Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s527">All the foreigners were in that little town.</span> <span id="s528">They all kept together.</span> <span id="s529">We used to go out together to see a movie or to a concert.</span> <span id="s530">Russian bands used to come and play dance music.</span> <span id="s531">So we used to go out and have a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">JO: Were you mostly Jews in that small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">BEn: Yes.</span> <span id="s534">There were a few Poles, in our place.</span> <span id="s535">It was different in other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">JO: Do you think that the fact that you were Jewish had anything to do with your being chosen for the kind of work you did, instead of for the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">BEN: No, we were people who were resettled...therefore not native Russians, and not trusted to go into the army.</span> <span id="s538">As foreigners we were not trusted for army duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">JO: This is the 2nd interview with Ben Muler.</span> <span id="s540">It is Sept. 19, 1984.</span> <span id="s541">The last time we talked you were telling me that you were working in a copper mill or a smelting plant, specifically that you were working on one of the furnaces.</span> <span id="s542">The last thing you told me is that you had moved to a place nearer to the mill where you lived in apartments, rather than in barracks.</span> <span id="s543">The friend whom you found along the way - was he still with you?</span> <span id="s544">Or, did he go elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">BEN: No, he was in the apartment near the mill and when they dispersed us from the barracks, they gave us living quarters and they put us together.</span> <span id="s546">The government of the little town gave us the place in which we were to live.</span> <span id="s547">In Russia you cannot find anything on your own.</span> <span id="s548">Everything is given to you and they tell you where you have to live and that is that.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">JO: So you were living together?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">BEN: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">JO: I was curious about the town.</span> <span id="s552">Was that something which had sprung up around the mill or was it a regular little town, which had been there for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">BEN: This little town must have been there for quite a while.</span> <span id="s554">However, when the war broke out in 1941, the Russian government built the factory there, since there were a lot of people.</span> <span id="s555">People who did not live there before were sent there to build the factory.</span> <span id="s556">They also built new living quarters and they built the mill from scratch.</span> <span id="s557">There had been nothing like that there before.</span> <span id="s558">They built a huge complex.</span> <span id="s559">That is where we lived until 1946.</span> <span id="s560">(The German surrender took place in April, 1945).</span></p> <p><span id="s561">JO: Were you in this apartment with your friend the entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s563">That is where we were from the day we moved in in 1942 until we were repatriated.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">JO: Now, when you were repatriated, did you go somewhere to check on that or did someone come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">BEN: We had an organization of Polish citizens in that little town, and there were organizations like this all over Russia.</span> <span id="s566">All the Polish citizens were registered.</span> <span id="s567">Any news pertaining to Polish citizens came to these organizations.</span> <span id="s568">Then we were notified that on a certain day we would quit our jobs and that we would have to be at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s569">They specified how much time we had for this.</span> <span id="s570">They stated that we could take anything we had as far as our belongings were concerned for the return to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">JO: What was the name of the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">BEN: This was the organization of Polish Citizens!</span> <span id="s573">That is what it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">JO: I believe that Dr. Berry told me that you met Bernice while you were in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s576">In 1943, I was working in the Mill with Bernice’s brother.</span> <span id="s577">I met him.</span> <span id="s578">We were not close friends, but we knew each other.</span> <span id="s579">He had two sisters and his parents.</span> <span id="s580">That was his family.</span> <span id="s581">They lived in another town.</span> <span id="s582">This fellow, Bernice’s brother, was drafted into the labor force and sent to work in this factory.</span> <span id="s583">We met there.</span> <span id="s584">Then, in 1944, his father passed away, and he brought his mother and two sisters to our little town.</span> <span id="s585">Both sisters went to work in the factory where I worked.</span> <span id="s586">On New Year’s Eve the organization of Polish citizens had a dance and get together.</span> <span id="s587">So the two sisters came to the dance and we started talking comparing experiences, etc.</span> <span id="s588">So I asked one of the sisters to dance and then we made another date.</span> <span id="s589">One time when we were going by train out of town; I had to go to see a doctor.</span> <span id="s590">I don’t remember why, but she went along.</span> <span id="s591">So, out of nowhere I popped out: “If you will marry me, I will take you to the U.S.” It was very cold, so she thought that I was crazy or hallucinating.</span> <span id="s592">How did I, in Siberia, in the Ural mountains, get off talking about taking someone to the U.S.?</span> <span id="s593">I believe that I mentioned, during our previous taping session that I had papers prior to the war that my relatives wanted me to come over to this country.</span> <span id="s594">However, the war had broken out before anything could happen.</span> <span id="s595">I knew that, one of these days, once I would get out of Russia, I would come to the U.S. So, after we got married, I didn’t promise anything else, just to bring her here.</span> <span id="s596">I did!</span></p> <p><span id="s597">JO: So, you have no plans to go back to Poland at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">BEN: Right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">JO: No, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">BEN: Then, yes!</span> <span id="s601">We went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s602">You know that all the Polish citizens were repatriated.</span> <span id="s603">We had been going together, just like friends, nothing like an engagement.</span> <span id="s604">However, when the Polish citizens were repatriated, I went with them formally, as with my fiancee’s family.</span> <span id="s605">I went together with them since I didn’t have any family.</span> <span id="s606">My sister, she was deep in Russia, and I didn’t know exactly where they were living.</span> <span id="s607">So I went with Bernice’s family and we traveled together to Poland.</span> <span id="s608">We had a very bad experience during that journey.</span> <span id="s609">While we were traveling, we were on the train and were coming closer to the Polish border.</span> <span id="s610">A lot of the Russian soldiers were coming back from Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s611">They were warning us: “Don’t go back to Poland!</span> <span id="s612">It is pretty bad over there.”</span> <span id="s613">Even today, after the war, the Poles are still killing Jews.</span> <span id="s614">Notice that that was after the war.</span> <span id="s615">They were telling us, “Don’t go!</span> <span id="s616">Don’t go over there!</span> <span id="s617">It is a bad place to go.”</span> <span id="s618">We went anyway.</span> <span id="s619">Right after we crossed the border from Russia to Poland, from Communist dictatorship to Poland, which was supposed to be a free society, all of a sudden, we were stunned because they were throwing stones and rocks at the train and screaming: “Jews go back to Russia!”</span> <span id="s620">We were afraid for our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">JO: Was this the general population?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">BEN: Yes, the general population.</span> <span id="s623">They were screaming such things as: “We are giving Russia coal and they are giving us back the Jews!”</span> <span id="s624">That was a very sad experience for us.</span> <span id="s625">None of the people who had lived in that vicinity, in one of the small towns, even stopped to see if anyone of their relatives were alive.</span> <span id="s626">Everybody went with the train until it stopped in Lodz, Poland (That is already southwest of Warsaw).</span> <span id="s627">There we disembarked from the train.</span> <span id="s628">There we already found representatives of the Joint, the same U.S. organization which had alerted the U.S. about the Lithuanian pogrom, and other Jewish organizations which sprang up right after the war.</span> <span id="s629">They started taking care of the people who returned from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">JO: Did you go back to Bernice’s hometown at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">BEN: No!</span> <span id="s632">I didn’t go to my hometown then.</span> <span id="s633">I had gone to my hometown while I was in Russia (Vilan, at the end of WWII was no longer Polish).</span> <span id="s634">When I came out of Russia, I never went back.</span> <span id="s635">Actually I couldn’t go back because they wouldn’t let me back in.</span> <span id="s636">We were in Lodz for approximately 3 weeks or 4 weeks.</span> <span id="s637">There were so many things going on, anti-semitic things, that I told my fiancee and her mother and brother that I was not going to stay there.</span> <span id="s638">I wanted to leave as soon as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">JO: Where did you stay during these weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">BEN: We stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">JO: Did you live in temporary housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">BEN: It was a small apartment which we rented.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">JO: What specific kind of anti-semitism did you experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">BEN: You could read in the paper, daily, the the AK (Army Karavioka or army of the fatherland) who were strong anti-communists and also anti-Jewish was taking young Polish soldiers, who were not with them, and Jews, off trains and shot right on the side of the railroad right of way.</span> <span id="s645">That was going on all the time, right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">JO: Who were these people of the AK?</span> <span id="s647">Did they have any connections with the Polish government?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">BEN: No.</span> <span id="s649">They were just bands of vigilantes.</span> <span id="s650">To the contrary of having things to do with the Polish government, they fought the Polish government.</span> <span id="s651">They were even shooting Polish officers from the government army.</span> <span id="s652">They did not want these officers to be in the army and support the government because the government at that time cooperated with the Russians.</span> <span id="s653">The Russian government said that these people wanted to discredit the government, which was exactly what they were trying to do.</span> <span id="s654">There was never a day where there was not an article in the paper that a soldier or a policeman was shot in cold blood.</span> <span id="s655">One of my teachers had a brother who was an army officer in Lodz.</span> <span id="s656">These people just came into his house and shot him in cold blood, in his own bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">JO: Was this well organized?</span> <span id="s658">Or were there just bands of vigilantes?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">BEN: I presume that they were well organized because they sabotaged a lot of the government’s work.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">JO: So this was not just random violence?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">BEN: Oh, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s662">JO: When you left Lodz, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">BEN: When I finally decided to leave, I told my fiancee that I was going and that if she wanted to she could come with me.</span> <span id="s664">That we would go to Czechoslovakia and then that we could see where we would finally land.</span> <span id="s665">There were Jewish organizations which helped people cross the border illegally.</span> <span id="s666">The border crossings had to be illegal, that was the only way in which we could leave Poland.</span> <span id="s667">They found roads where it was possible to cross with the help of Polish soldiers who were paid off, so that they would take people over the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">JO: So you had to pay money to get out of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">BEN: I did not have to pay anything.</span> <span id="s670">This border crossing was organized by the Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s671">The individual involved did not have to pay.</span> <span id="s672">If you wanted to go, they willingly took you.</span> <span id="s673">You had the choice to go to Austria, or Germany and from there, further.</span> <span id="s674">That was in 1946, so Israel did not yet exist, but the Jewish organizations had the vision of a Jewish State, so they wanted to have a large Jewish immigration to Israel, although that was illegal.</span> <span id="s675">Such possible immigration to Palestine, as it still was known, was the reason why so many people left Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">JO: Did you ever think about going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">BEN: I truly always wanted to be in Israel, but as already said, my dream was the U.S.</span> <span id="s678">After the losses to my family during the war, this was the only place where I had relatives.</span> <span id="s679">I had 2 aunts in t he U.S., one in New York and one in Mississippi.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">JO: Did you stop anywhere for any length of time, on your way to the U.S.:?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s682">We stopped for a short period of time in Austria, actually in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s683">Then we crossed the border to Germany where we went to a camp for Displaced Persons (Such camps were set up by the Western allies of WWII to allow people to stay until someplace could be found for them to move to.</span> <span id="s684">Displaced Persons [DP], included people who had been prisoners of the NAZIS or forcibly rounded up for forced labor work in Germany, Austria, etc., to help the German war effort.</span> <span id="s685">It also included people who did not consider that it was economically viable, politically safe or otherwise felt they couldn’t stand their original environment as an alternative to returning the the places of their birth.</span> <span id="s686">Note should be taken that often, right after the fighting of WWII stopped, political boundaries were arbitrarily modified and populations were forcibly relocated.</span> <span id="s687">DP camps were presumably only for the victims of NAZI persecutions and were later extended to victims of communism).</span> <span id="s688">The DP camp where we were was in Hof on the Saale River (50.19N,11.55E) in Upper Bavaria near the Czechoslovak border.</span> <span id="s689">We arrived there.</span> <span id="s690">That DP had been organized by the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s691">They took us from Salzburg to Hof by train.</span> <span id="s692">Army trucks were waiting at the railroad station to take us to camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">JO: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">BEN: I was there for about 3 1/2 years.</span> <span id="s695">When we arrived in the camp, just as I got off the truck, a man came up to me and said “Do you want a job?</span> <span id="s696">Do you want to work?”</span> <span id="s697">I told him I wanted to work.</span> <span id="s698">He said: “O.K., then you are the billeting officer.</span> <span id="s699">You will be the one who will give out the apartments.”</span> <span id="s700">I told him I didn’t yet know what the camp looked like and he told me that I would know.</span> <span id="s701">Twenty minutes after that I was the one giving apartments to everyone in the camp.</span> <span id="s702">You know I was giving all the people who had arrived on the train with me a place where they could live.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">JO: Were all these apartments new?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">BEN: No, these had been army barracks, from the German army.</span> <span id="s705">They had small rooms, private rooms, no kitchens, no refrigeration or anything of the kind but they were nice rooms.</span> <span id="s706">The U.S. army provided us with folding cots and blankets.</span> <span id="s707">So you see, it wasn't so bad; when we came in we had a place to lay down.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">JO: So you ate in mess halls?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s710">We had a mess hall and for a short period probably a month, until things got organized, we ate there.</span> <span id="s711">Then everyone wa given rations and they cooked in their apartments and we ate there.</span> <span id="s712">By then everybody had a hot plate and we bought dishes and such things and we lived a normal life.</span> <span id="s713">There were, of course, only small quarters, but everybody kept clean.</span> <span id="s714">If people were there with a child or two, they got a little bigger room.</span> <span id="s715">So it was pretty good for the time we were there.</span> <span id="s716">We stayed there, in Hof, for about 2 1/2 years (this is a variance of my early statement); then the cold war with Berlin started.</span> <span id="s717">So they did not want the DP’s to be right at the border with Czechoslovakia and the Iron Curtain.</span> <span id="s718">They got concerned that there could be some fighting.</span> <span id="s719">So, since I was the billeting officer, they called me in from the U.S. Army and told me to go and look for another place, for another camp where we could be resettled.</span> <span id="s720">So we found a camp in Begendorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">JO: So this was about 1949 now?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">BEN: This was 1948.</span> <span id="s723">I will never forget that either.</span> <span id="s724">That was quite an experience also to go around Germany to find a camp.</span> <span id="s725">I had orders from the High Commissioner for Germany.</span> <span id="s726">I had orders to look over the various places to make certain that it was suitable for our people.</span> <span id="s727">I arrived in Begendorf (was not able to locate this on the map; either it is too small place or the location was not understood).</span> <span id="s728">There were still Military Police (MP’s) at the gate.</span> <span id="s729">The MP’s were residing in the camp.</span> <span id="s730">I walked over to the MP post and I told them that I wanted to see the Provost Marshal (PM) who was in charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s731">They asked me why and I told them that I wanted to see him so I could look over the camp in order to prepare it for displaced persons.</span> <span id="s732">The soldier gave me a mouthful of words: “You Jews will not get this camp!”</span> <span id="s733">So I told him I didn’t come to talk to him - I wanted to speak with the Marshal.</span> <span id="s734">I had papers from the High Commissioner to see him and I had nothing to do with this man.</span> <span id="s735">So he saw that I had authority and that the PM was expecting me and he took me over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">JO: Now, this American, was he a young man?</span> <span id="s737">I am just curious about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">BEN: He was in the army.</span> <span id="s739">He couldn’t be more than 23 or 24, something like that.</span> <span id="s740">I figured that there was no use getting someone into trouble and to start something so I didn’t even mention the incident to the PM.</span> <span id="s741">The PM called a few soldiers into his office and they took me through the camp.</span> <span id="s742">After I looked it over and saw what beautiful nice quarters they had in the large brick buildings, I came back and said, “Yes, we will take it!”</span> <span id="s743">After I was done, I went back to the gate and saw that the same soldier was there and I told him: “I am coming back!</span> <span id="s744">And, you will go out of here.”</span> <span id="s745">That, of course, was the end of it.</span> <span id="s746">Then, 2 months later the entire camp moved there, that is, from Hof to Biedenkopf (this time this is what the camp’s name sounded like.</span> <span id="s747">There is such a town located in the U.S. Zone at 50.55N,8.32E).</span></p> <p><span id="s748">JO: Did you work for pay and buy things for money in the camp?</span> <span id="s749">Or, was it a barter economy?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">BEN: In camp we were getting all our rations from IRO, the International Refugee Organization.</span> <span id="s751">We worked for them, and we got food rations and clothing.</span> <span id="s752">Every person worked at something in the camp.</span> <span id="s753">Some people took care of cleaning, carpentry work.</span> <span id="s754">I described what I was doing, that was a job which didn’t stop because we had a constant turnover of people.</span> <span id="s755">People were coming over from Czechoslovakia or Austria and I had to find them a place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">JO: Was Bernice’s family still with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">BEN: No!</span> <span id="s758">There was just Bernice and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">JO: Where did they stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">BEN: They stayed back in Poland, in Lodz.</span> <span id="s761">They stayed there until 1954.</span> <span id="s762">In 1954 they emigrated to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">JO: Since it was so bad there, was there a reason why they stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">BEN: My brother-in-law got into business there.</span> <span id="s765">He opened a tailor shop.</span> <span id="s766">Business went quite well, so they figured: “Oh, another year!</span> <span id="s767">,” and then another year and then they would go on.</span> <span id="s768">Then things started getting really bad; it was 1954.</span> <span id="s769">So, they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">JO: So they just put up with anti-semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">BEN: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s772">Anti-semitism and all other kinds of nuisances.</span> <span id="s773">When he went to buy clothes or other material, he had to pay money “under the table” to get it.</span> <span id="s774">He had to pay for his shop also.</span> <span id="s775">It was hard, but he made a living.</span> <span id="s776">He could take it.</span> <span id="s777">I couldn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">JO: Was there any violence ever done to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">BEN: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">JO: Where were you and Bernice married?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">BEN: We were married in Hof, Germany.</span> <span id="s782">It was the 1st thing we did when we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">JO: Were you married by a Rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">BEN: Yes, a Rabbi married us and we also had a civil ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">JO: I guess that that is common in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">BEN: Yes, it is.</span> <span id="s787">In Russia there are no Rabbis, there you go into the government office and you get married right there, on the spot.</span> <span id="s788">They write on a paper that you are married, and that is it.</span> <span id="s789">In Germany we went into the City Hall.</span> <span id="s790">They had a ceremony there and then they give you a marriage certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">JO: Were Bernice’s family able to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">BEN: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s793">JO: That is right, they could not travel.</span> <span id="s794">It was illegal to cross the borders.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">BEN: That is so, they could not travel from Poland to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">JO: How much longer were you there after the camp moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">BEN: Until 1949.</span> <span id="s798">In 1949 I finally went through the American consul.</span> <span id="s799">Then I knew that I am going to the U.S. My papers were in order.</span> <span id="s800">That gave us a date when we could go.</span> <span id="s801">Our son was born 7 months prior to that, still in Germany, so when we came to the U.S., he was 8 months old.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">JO: Were you pretty much in the DP camp, just waiting for your papers to come through?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">BEN: Yes, that was our main purpose for being there.</span> <span id="s804">If you wanted to go to Israel, you could go any day, anytime you wanted to go.</span> <span id="s805">Until May 1948 you couldn’t go there legally because the English wouldn’t let you in, but you could go there illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">JO: I believe President Truman had D.P. laws passed.</span> <span id="s807">(Is that what allowed you to come in?)</span> <span id="s808">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s809">That was in 1947, if I am not mistaken.</span> <span id="s810">That is when the law was passed and then the immigration started, to the U.S. and to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">JO: Did you arrive in N.Y.?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">BEN: No.</span> <span id="s813">We arrived in Boston.</span> <span id="s814">The first thing we saw when we arrived in Boston was a Polish store with a big sign: “We sell herrings!”</span> <span id="s815">That was kind of funny to see such a sign in Polish!</span> <span id="s816">The Joint (the Jewish organization I mentioned earlier) was waiting for us there.</span> <span id="s817">They were actually waiting for all the transports.</span> <span id="s818">We were on an army ship, the S.S. General Hershey.</span> <span id="s819">Instead of returning soldiers or sailors, there were like 2000 people.</span> <span id="s820">(When these General and Admiral size ships were used for troop transports, they carried about 4000 servicemen; but that did not include any families).</span> <span id="s821">It was like a cattle boat, however, everybody was happy that they were finally going somewhere, and were about to start a decent, new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">JO: How long were you at sea?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">BEN: 8 days.</span> <span id="s824">I was then 27 years old.</span> <span id="s825">Actually 8 or 9 days.</span> <span id="s826">It was not hard for me to take, but Bernice was sick from the time we crossed the English Channel until we were in the harbor of Boston.</span> <span id="s827">She was terribly seasick.</span> <span id="s828">In Boston, people from the Joint &amp; HIAS were waiting.</span> <span id="s829">They knew all about me because they had two tickets for my wife and me to go to New York, by train since my aunt wanted to see me.</span> <span id="s830">They also had 2 more tickets for us to go from New York to Mississippi.</span> <span id="s831">That was going to be my final destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">JO: So you were going to see both aunts?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">BEN: No.</span> <span id="s834">My aunt from M ississippi had sent me the papers, to come there.</span> <span id="s835">However, my aunt from New York, when she heard that I was coming, she sent me tickets.</span> <span id="s836">She wanted to see me in N.Y. since going to N.Y. from Mississippi would be a long extra trip, an expensive trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">JO: How long were you in Boston?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">BEN: Maybe two hours in Boston, at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s839">Many years later, I went to Boston and found that it is a beautiful city.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">JO: Then you went to N.Y.?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">BEN: Yes, we went to New York and at the railroad station, my cousins, a few cousins and my aunt were there.</span> <span id="s842">They took us to my aunt’s apartment.</span> <span id="s843">There, there were two cousins from Vilna, 2 young girls, who had survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s844">All their family was gone, everybody else had gone to the ovens.</span> <span id="s845">They had survived.</span> <span id="s846">They had gone through hell, including quite a few concentration camps.</span> <span id="s847">They were in N.Y.</span> <span id="s848">A cousin of ours from N.Y., he had been in the U.S. army, during WWII.</span> <span id="s849">He had happened to be in Belgium.</span> <span id="s850">He was talking to some people; survivors, and when they started talking - all of a sudden he found out that two of the girls he was talking to were his cousins.</span> <span id="s851">He had not known that they hd survived.</span> <span id="s852">They knew nothing about addresses or names of their aunt in N.Y.</span> <span id="s853">He called right away his mother and told her about the meeting.</span> <span id="s854">They sent the girls papers to bring them to the U.S. So, when we arrived in N.Y., they were there living with my aunt.</span> <span id="s855">That was quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">JO: Yes, it must have been!</span> <span id="s857">How long did you stay in N.Y.?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">BEN: We stayed in NYC for three days.</span> <span id="s859">A lot of people came to see us because every time somebody came, it was listed in the Jewish Press.</span> <span id="s860">So when they saw in the papers that we had arrived and where we were staying, they came and brought us flowers and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s861">So my uncle said: “Who are they and what did you do for the people so that they bring you so much candy and flowers!”</span> <span id="s862">He just couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s863">We had a nice reunion and stayed a few days and then we left for Mississippi.</span> <span id="s864">When we arrived in Mississippi, I could never imagine that my aunt and uncle would live in a small town like that.</span> <span id="s865">That was truly a little town, a really small place.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">JO: What was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">BEN: Itta Bena (1980 population of 2904).</span> <span id="s868">I believe that I mentioned in the previous interview that I was sick, that I burned my leg in Russia, when I worked in the smelter.</span> <span id="s869">When I was in the hospital, it happened and I thought about my relatives.</span> <span id="s870">I couldn’t remember the address exactly, but I always remembered that the name of the town was the first name of my sister and mine.</span> <span id="s871">So I just sent a letter from the hospital to Mr. Jack Protrick, Itta Bena, no street, no nothing, and THEY GOT THE LETTER!</span></p> <p><span id="s872">JO: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">BEN: We stayed with my relatives for a short time because I could not find any work in my trade.</span> <span id="s874">I was a printer by trade.</span> <span id="s875">My uncle found me a job in a little larger town, 7 miles away, in Greenwood, as a printer, in a newspaper.</span> <span id="s876">I went to work at night since I worked the 2nd shift.</span> <span id="s877">There was a sports reporter who also lived in Itta Bena.</span> <span id="s878">He used to take me to work.</span> <span id="s879">He also took me home again.</span> <span id="s880">I worked at that job for about 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s881">After that he gave me an envelope and I was polite and didn’t open it right away.</span> <span id="s882">So, when he left, I opened it up.</span> <span id="s883">He had paid me $17.00 for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s884">I had worked 40 hours a week.</span> <span id="s885">I came home and I showed the check to my wife.</span> <span id="s886">So she started crying.</span> <span id="s887">She said “That is what we came to the U.S. for?”</span> <span id="s888">for that kind of pay?”</span> <span id="s889">I said: “Don’t worry, I will find something better.</span> <span id="s890">Let me just look around.</span> <span id="s891">One night as we ere driving back to Itta Bena, he said “Ben, I have to ask you a question: how much is the boss paying you for work?”</span> <span id="s892">I said: “Why do you ask?”</span> <span id="s893">He said: “The reason I am asking is because the boss goes around all over town.</span> <span id="s894">He talks to the printers that he has a fantastic man, an excellent craftsman and that he doesn’t have to pay him anything.</span> <span id="s895">So this is why I am asking how much you are earning for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s896">I told him he gave me a check for $17.00 for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s897">The reporter stopped the car and he said: “What, how could he do it to you, going around talking that you are doing the best work he ever had done and taking advantage because you are a newcomer!</span> <span id="s898">He surely is taking advantage of you.”</span> <span id="s899">I couldn’t argue with him and said I would have to look for something better.</span> <span id="s900">He said: “I look for something else for you.</span> <span id="s901">Will you go somewhere else if I find you another job?”</span> <span id="s902">I said: “I will have to.</span> <span id="s903">I cannot live on $8.50 a week!”</span> <span id="s904">A week or so went by and the reporter was taking me to work one day and asked if I could go to Jackson, Miss. that Sunday.</span> <span id="s905">“I talked to the foreman in the big newspaper there, the Courier-Ledger, and he said that he would like to see you,” the reporter said, “he needs printers.”</span> <span id="s906">I went down there on a Sunday and talked to the foreman.</span> <span id="s907">The foreman told me “Ben, I can see that you are a printer.</span> <span id="s908">I look at your hands and I can see that you are a printer.</span> <span id="s909">We pay $1.55 per hour.</span> <span id="s910">That was in 1950.</span> <span id="s911">I will start you with $1.50 and if you know the work well, I will give you the other nickel.</span> <span id="s912">When can you come to work?”</span> <span id="s913">I told him I didn’t want to mess up the other man, but I would give two weeks’ notice and be in Jackson in two weeks.</span> <span id="s914">So, when I came back I told Mr. Blake the owner “Mr. Blake, I am giving you 2 weeks’ notice.</span> <span id="s915">Then I am leaving.”</span> <span id="s916">He said: “Why, didn’t I treat you right?”</span> <span id="s917">I told him I had a wife and a child and I could not live off my uncle’s charity.</span> <span id="s918">I had to make a living for myself.</span> <span id="s919">So he said: “I will pay you anything you want!</span> <span id="s920">You just mention the price and I will pay it.”</span> <span id="s921">I told him that it was too late and I had a job somewhere else.</span> <span id="s922">After I quit there I went to Jackson, Miss. and started working.</span> <span id="s923">After the 1st hour, the foreman walked by, looked at me working and said: ”You are getting the other nickel, and you can work as much overtime as you want.”</span> <span id="s924">So I worked 40 hours, regular pay, and 30 hours overtime, the first week.</span> <span id="s925">It was hard, but at least we saw results.</span> <span id="s926">An incident which I have to mention was very gratifying to my wife and to me.</span> <span id="s927">When I worked on that job the first day a man whom I didn’t know, watched me constantly working, to see what I was doing.</span> <span id="s928">At the end of the day, he came up to me and said: “Ben, I am quitting here.</span> <span id="s929">I am going to be a foreman in Tuscaloosa, Alabama for the newspaper.</span> <span id="s930">I like your work.</span> <span id="s931">If you come to work for me I will give you a quarter an hour more.</span> <span id="s932">Would you like to come to work for me?”</span> <span id="s933">I said: “No, I took the job here, and will stay here as long as they treat me right.</span> <span id="s934">If something happens, I will look you up.”</span> <span id="s935">He went on: “Do you have an apartment?”</span> <span id="s936">I said, “No, I am staying at the Y. I will wait until I find an apartment, then I will bring my wife here with my child.</span> <span id="s937">He said: “I am going away, and am leaving.</span> <span id="s938">I live in a pretty nice complex.</span> <span id="s939">Can you go with me after work and I will talk to the people there.</span> <span id="s940">There is a big list, a waiting list for people to get apartments there, but I know the management quite well, so I will see if I can get you that apartment.</span> <span id="s941">Do you have a refrigerator and a stove?”</span> <span id="s942">I said: “No, not yet, but one day I will buy them, as soon as I get my paycheck.”</span> <span id="s943">So he said: “Here is a brand new refrigerator and a brand new stove.</span> <span id="s944">Whenever you can afford to buy another one you go to this store where I bought it and buy one.</span> <span id="s945">They will crate it up and ship it to me.</span> <span id="s946">Use these as long as you need them.”</span> <span id="s947">That was the first experience I had in the U.S. where people were really nice and went out of their way to make a refugee, a newcomer, feel right.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">JO: Did you experience any anti-semitism when you arrived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">BEN: In the shop in Jackson, Miss. it was not truly anti-semitism, however, I had an experience with an older man.</span> <span id="s950">The first day I started working there, he came up to me and said: “Mr. Ben, refugees are not supposed to work in printing shops; they are supposed to be on farms.”</span> <span id="s951">I look at him and I did not know what to say so I sad: “Mr., I am a printer and I work in a printing shop; if you are a farmer, you can go to work on a farm!”</span> <span id="s952">That man did not talk to me for a year and one year later, when I quit this job in Jackson to move up to Dayton, he came up to me to apologize and he said “Mr. Ben, I am sorry that I spoke to you as I did.</span> <span id="s953">You are a printer and you should work in a printing shop!”</span></p> <p><span id="s954">JO: That was the only prejudicial statement which was made to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">BEN: That was the only one I can remember.</span> <span id="s956">I never had any problems.</span> <span id="s957">You know you hear all kinds of ethnic jokes, but they are never meant in malice, but that does not mean anti-semitism to me...it is just talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">JO: How did you wind up in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">BEN: When I worked for the Courier-Ledger in Jackson, I saw an advertisement in the paper that a printing house in Dayton “Dayton Typographic” is looking for printers.</span> <span id="s960">They circulated ads all over the country.</span> <span id="s961">In 1951 it was very hard to get printers, everybody was looking, so I wrote them letter.</span> <span id="s962">I asked them whether they had a position for me.</span> <span id="s963">I told them I was a newcomer to the U.S., that I had been here for only 1 year; that I was a printer, and that I would like to get a job, if possible.</span> <span id="s964">I received a letter from them asking me to come up and talk to them.</span> <span id="s965">They have plenty of jobs available, but they would like to talk to me to see if I know enough English and if I understand what is what.</span> <span id="s966">They are commercial printers.</span> <span id="s967">They wanted to be sure that I knew the trade and since the didn’t want to bring me up here just to send me back.</span> <span id="s968">So, on my vacation, I decided to come up to Dayton and talked to the people.</span> <span id="s969">The boss told me that I was fine; that he would like to have me in his shop, but that I would have to get a union card.</span> <span id="s970">The place where I was working in Jackson was nonunion.</span> <span id="s971">I went to the union here in Dayton and talked to the president.</span> <span id="s972">He told me that I would have to go back to my local in Jackson, Miss.</span> <span id="s973">There was a typographical union local in Jackson.</span> <span id="s974">That I had to apply in Jackson.</span> <span id="s975">He added: “If they want to give you a card, then come back here and we will see what we can do for you.”</span> <span id="s976">So, I went back to Jackson, and got a union card right away.</span> <span id="s977">Two weeks later, I left for Dayton.</span> <span id="s978">Here, I worked for this man for about 3 months; the old timers in the shop were getting a 6th day per week as overtime, and 2 hours overtime daily.</span> <span id="s979">I, on the other hand, was only getting the 2 hours of daily overtime.</span> <span id="s980">So naturally, I was unhappy.</span> <span id="s981">I told the foreman that I was not happy with that arrangement, but he didn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s982">At that time at the Dayton Daily News, you could work as much overtime as you wanted, because they had a lot of work, and not enough printers.</span> <span id="s983">So, I went over there.</span> <span id="s984">They told me: “Yes, you can come any day.</span> <span id="s985">We would like to have you.”</span> <span id="s986">So I didn’t decide anything.</span> <span id="s987">However, one day a printer passed by my press and said to me: “Ben you know what the foreman said about you?”</span> <span id="s988">I asked him what it was and he said: “That you stay here in the shop for life.”</span> <span id="s989">I said “You go tell the foreman that I am quitting!”</span> <span id="s990">He said: “What did you say?”</span> <span id="s991">I repeated it and added: “That is exactly what I said: tell him that I am quitting.”</span> <span id="s992">He went to the foreman and told him.</span> <span id="s993">The foreman came over and said: “What do you mean?</span> <span id="s994">You are quitting!”</span> <span id="s995">I said: “That is exactly what I said.</span> <span id="s996">I have asked you for the 6th day of work and you didn’t give it to me.</span> <span id="s997">So I went to the Dayton Daily News and they have an opening and with as much overtime as I need.</span> <span id="s998">I came here without a penny to my name.</span> <span id="s999">I came to this country without anything and I have to work hard to make it.”</span> <span id="s1000">He said “O.K. I’ll give you the 6th day.</span> <span id="s1001">I told him it was too late and I was going to the News.”</span> <span id="s1002">So I went to the News.</span> <span id="s1003">I worked there, my wages were higher, the overtime was as much as I wanted to work.</span> <span id="s1004">I worked there until the end of the year.</span> <span id="s1005">All of a sudden, after New Years, that is when the slow season started, they started laying off people in the Dayton Daily News.</span> <span id="s1006">The foreman laid off 20 people who had come on board after me.</span> <span id="s1007">I was the 21st to go.</span> <span id="s1008">He came to me and said “Ben, if I lay you off for two weeks, I have to lay off two more people, besides you.</span> <span id="s1009">I will hire you back.”</span> <span id="s1010">I said “Jim (Jim Mendenhall was the foreman), I have never been laid off in my life.</span> <span id="s1011">If you lay me off, you will never see me again!”</span> <span id="s1012">He said: “Forget it!</span> <span id="s1013">You stay and the other two guys stay, on account of you.</span> <span id="s1014">I don’t want to lose you.”</span> <span id="s1015">I stayed with them for 14 years.</span> <span id="s1016">Those were good years!</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">JO: Did you retire from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">BEN: I didn’t retire!</span> <span id="s1019">I worked for the News for 14 years and then I saw that a check is a check and you cannot make more out of it.</span> <span id="s1020">Another year, another $5.00 a week increase.</span> <span id="s1021">So I started thinking about going into business.</span> <span id="s1022">Some of my friends whom I had met here in Dayton were in the scrap metal business.</span> <span id="s1023">They made a better living than I did on the job.</span> <span id="s1024">So, I thought that I would try it out.</span> <span id="s1025">I tried it out and it worked out pretty well for me.</span> <span id="s1026">So, now I am in the scrap metal business.</span> <span id="s1027">I gave up printing and went into junk.</span> <span id="s1028">My daughter who was born in Dayton, one day came to me and said: “Dad, before this you worked for the Dayton Daily News.</span> <span id="s1029">That was such a nice job, a printer.</span> <span id="s1030">When the teacher asks what the fathers of the students are doing, I used to say that you worked for the Dayton Daily News, where he is a printer.</span> <span id="s1031">Now, what will I say?</span> <span id="s1032">That he is a junkie, that he works with junk?”</span> <span id="s1033">I answered: “Don’t worry, don’t tell them that.</span> <span id="s1034">If they ask you, tell them that your dad is an M.D.” She said, “An M.D. is a doctor.”</span> <span id="s1035">I said: “No, you tell them that it is a metal dealer.”</span> <span id="s1036">As you see, we do have a little fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">JO: Was that Mr. Appel who informed you about the scrap metal business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">BEN: No.</span> <span id="s1039">I knew Mr. Appel.</span> <span id="s1040">I knew other people here in town in the scrap metal business.</span> <span id="s1041">There were quite a few other people in that business.</span> <span id="s1042">I started on my own and it worked out.</span> <span id="s1043">I deal mainly with printers, because I know their language and I know the material, so most of my dealings are with printers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">JO: I guess that I just have one last question: I believe that you told me last time that your family was orthodox.</span> <span id="s1045">Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">BEN: No.</span> <span id="s1047">They were not orthodox.</span> <span id="s1048">They were observing Jews, it was a Kosher home.</span> <span id="s1049">The house was set up according to the rituals, the Jewish rituals, but I would not say that my father was orthodox.</span> <span id="s1050">That he went every morning and every evening to pray, and every Saturday to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1051">No.</span> <span id="s1052">That was not the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">JO: Did you manage, during the time you were in Russia, and during the time you were in Europe, after the war, to attend services and otherwise to observe your religion?</span> <span id="s1054">Was there religion in your life, besides your marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">BEN: Not in Russia.</span> <span id="s1056">We worked hard in Russia, it was a hard life, and there was not much thinking about religion.</span> <span id="s1057">After the war, when I came back and I saw what happened in Poland, and I saw what happened to my parents and relatives, I was mad.</span> <span id="s1058">I was truly mad.</span> <span id="s1059">I didn’t believe in a God.</span> <span id="s1060">I didn’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s1061">I didn’t believe that there is a God, so that something like this could have happened.</span> <span id="s1062">However, when I arrived in the U.S. and mellowed a little, things changed and today I am on the Board of the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1063">I have been on that Board for the last 25 years.</span> <span id="s1064">I also work with a lot of Jewish organizations in order to help other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">JO: What Temple do you belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">BEN: Beth Jacob Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1067">I have belonged there for the last 33 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">JO: Have you and Bernice always kept Kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">BEN: Yes.</span> <span id="s1070">We have kept Kosher most of the time.</span> <span id="s1071">Our daughter is very observant.</span> <span id="s1072">Our son is not so observant.</span> <span id="s1073">Our daughter and her husband are very observant.</span> <span id="s1074">To make them feel welcome in our house, we keep strictly Kosher; in this way, they are free to come and enjoy their mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">JO: What kind of organizations do you work with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">BEN: Right here, in Dayton, I have worked with the UJA (United Jewish Appeal), ORT (Organization for Technical Retraining), for the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s1077">I also was a member of the Typographical Union, and worked for them.</span> <span id="s1078">I am on the Board of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">JO: Do you have anything to do with refugee organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">BEN: We helped when the Russian refugees started coming in the late ‘70’s.</span> <span id="s1081">I tried to help those who came to Dayton as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1082">I am also on the Board of the Refugees from Poland, the displaced persons from Poland.</span> <span id="s1083">I always have worked with them.</span> <span id="s1084">We have Memorial Services here, which I started with two other people.</span> <span id="s1085">In 1963 we started the memorial Service to the memory of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1086">I have also worked with the Jewish Federation of Greater Dayton to build a memorial.</span> <span id="s1087">I was one of the first people to start talking about that.</span> <span id="s1088">We built the memorial on the grounds of the Jewish Federation, the Jesse philips Building of the Jewish Community Center (JCC) of Greater Dayton.</span> <span id="s1089">That memorial was dedicated last year, in 1983.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">JO: Do you feel that anything like the Holocaust can happen in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">BEN: It can happen anyplace, not only in this country, anyplace.</span> <span id="s1092">If a strong person, who is a good speaker, and times are economically bad.</span> <span id="s1093">If the financial, the economic situation of the country is bad, a person can always arouse other people to do things they never dreamed of doing; then you take normal people and turn them into beasts.</span> <span id="s1094">This first Holocaust showed that people, who never had dreamed of being murderers, they were educated, cultured people, and got turned into animals, into beasts.</span> <span id="s1095">IT CAN HAPPEN ANYPLACE, providing there is a leader and times are bad.</span></p></body></html>
