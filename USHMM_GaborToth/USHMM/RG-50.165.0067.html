Austria and there was a big stadium...where they were making bread for the front and we loaded bread...on the trucks... we were in seventh heaven...we were able to eat a piece of bread...we were there for about a week...they we were marched deeper and deeper into .....Austria...for about two days without nothing.</span> <span id="s211">No food at all . . . we were eating grass...they took us into

id="s217">He was much taller than me.</span> <span id="s218">About 6' 1" or 6' and he was a giant of a man...he could qualify for anything, you know, such a SMART…and he was lying there and when I saw him I started to cry...I started to cry so - and he's asking me - and he’s recognize me and he saw me he saw me and he says, "Why, why you crying?</span> <span id="s219">Do I look so bad?”</span> <span id="s220">Do I look so bad?</span> <span id="s221">Do I look so bad?"</span> <span id="s222">And he was a skin and bone...so then, the next day he died.</span> <span id="s223">Like that he died...then they took us...by the hundreds they marched us...not far from Mauthausen ...a huge building...with dirt floor…everybody was sick already...an epidemic of typhus.</span> <span id="s224">They were dying like fleas...we stayed outside under a tree.</span> <span id="s225">It was April.</span> <span id="s226">It was still icy, rain, icy rain falling, you know.</span> <span id="s227">At night, you know, we were staying there under the tree and making a fire.</span> <span id="s228">We could-they allowed us and there was wires all around, the guards standing, standing around the camp, you know, there was this small, outside this, ehr, this with the wire there was a road brought us - we came in there, that road.</span> <span id="s229">Outside there was this building there where the guards stayed.</span> <span id="s230">There was, I think, a kitchen that, too, sometime they brought us in some beet soup.</span> <span id="s231">Beet-I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s232">Water.</span> <span id="s233">Nothing but - there was also there they brought us in once, I think, I remember they gave us, I think, ehr, I remember on the third day they came, they gave us, they sliced up a bread, also divided it into slices.</span> <span id="s234">I don't remember how many people a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s235">And, uh, there people were dead all over the place.</span> <span id="s236">They were dying like fleas.</span> <span id="s237">And the more I remember, a couple of days there was rain, the weather was so bad, I don't now how long it lasted.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A day or two.</span> <span id="s239">Rain, rain.</span> <span id="s240">And then all of a sudden it cleared up, and, the-sun-the sun came out.</span> <span id="s241">This-and we were-I'm staying outside already.</span> <span id="s242">I was staying-we were-didn't go inside the building because there was no room.</span> <span id="s243">There was dying, people dead allover the place there.</span> <span id="s244">Dead.</span> <span id="s245">You know, you lie down and you huddle together to keep warm, you know, so you could get up in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Or next to you, and, each side was dead.</span> <span id="s247">You know, you were in the middle, still moving, you know.</span> <span id="s248">People were hanging down from the-there was there these beams you know, open beams, you know, they were hanging down from beams, sitting up there, you know, trying to-there was no windows, you know, the windows
