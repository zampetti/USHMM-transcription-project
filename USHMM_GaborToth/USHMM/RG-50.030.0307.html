you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is _______________ and they used to call us Willy or Wilek.</span> <span id="s13">Loew was L‑OW, but when I came to the United States it was changed to L‑O‑E‑W.</span> <span id="s14">So the name actually here in the United States is William Loew, but my friends back at home they remember me as Wilek.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in Lwów, Lemberg.</span> <span id="s16">Lemberg is basically a German name for Louve and my parents came from probably Austria.</span> <span id="s17">I'm not quite sure, but from Austria and we settled down in Lwów.</span> <span id="s18">That was Galicia at the time and also known as a Austria Hungarian empire.</span> <span id="s19">The time in the ____________ when I was born I had basically a nice family, a wonderful family.</span> <span id="s20">Let me speak about my brothers.</span> <span id="s21">I had an older brother we used to call Eli.</span> <span id="s22">The oldest one was Abe.</span> <span id="s23">We had a very close family.</span> <span id="s24">My mother was verywas a housewife but also dealing in business.</span> <span id="s25">Our business was we had a brewery a mead brewery which is a honey wine.</span> <span id="s26">The business was quite prosperous.</span> <span id="s27">For one thing, our business has been derived from previous generations.</span> <span id="s28">We started, but not my father but my grandfather and my uncles they started in 1870.</span> <span id="s29">As a matter of fact I still have one of the labels of our original wines which is a honey wine.</span> <span id="s30">Our family was approximately 80 persons strong counting my uncles, my grandfathers from either side, my mother's and my father's side.</span> <span id="s31">We were more numerous on my father's side than on my mother's side.</span> <span id="s32">My mother's maiden name was Margulies and some of her brothers went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s33">At that time in 1932, 1933 and the remainder stayed there in ____________ at that time.</span> <span id="s34">We stayed and we tried to continue our business.</span> <span id="s35">My father died when I was four years old.</span> <span id="s36">He died probably 1929 so my mother actually took over the business.</span> <span id="s37">I don't think she was a good business woman from what I recall.</span> <span id="s38">The business continued.</span> <span id="s39">We had my oldest brother could not get into a university in _____________ because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he had to move out from Louve to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s40">So, he studied there.</span> <span id="s41">This was expensive to study in Warsaw because the money that we had from the business was not that prosperous.</span> <span id="s42">I'm not quite sure the reason for it but I think that my mother wasn't as aggressive in the business as she should be.</span> <span id="s43">So, if I recall sometime in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and we were no longer in the business of honey wine.</span> <span id="s44">But my uncles they continued to be in business.</span> <span id="s45">At that time in that previous years, we used to export our wine to different areas of Poland that we know and also to other countries.</span> <span id="s46">The Jewish life in Louve was the best that can be said back in '37 '38 from what I can recall was lukewarm.</span> <span id="s47">It wasn't very bad.</span> <span id="s48">It wasn't very good.</span> <span id="s49">We did have our quotas going to school as a matter of fact when I went for my exam to enter the gymnasium even though the gymnasium was ten blocks away from me, I couldn't get in because I had a quota.</span> <span id="s50">I passed I understand my entry exam, but I couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s51">That was back in 1938.</span> <span id="s52">So, in order to continue my studies I had to move on somewhere else and I had to go to another gymnasium back on Louve on _____________ Street.</span> <span id="s53">It was known as the Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s54">Going back to '38, '38 was a fairly peaceful years for our family but it was a hardship because we couldn't meet the loans that my father apparently incurred.</span> <span id="s55">So, things were difficult.</span> <span id="s56">My oldest brother Abe who was in Warsaw, he finished his master's degree and he came back home and he tried to stabilize, because he was basically the oldest in our family, he tried to stabilize the family.</span> <span id="s57">Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his own good.</span> <span id="s58">He was not part ofhe would try to help stabilize the family but we used to love each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year old boys used to do.</span> <span id="s59">Abe on the other hand was much older that we were.</span> <span id="s60">He was older than I by ten years so he was more a serious person and he had very little in common with us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many ways.</span> <span id="s61">In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were quite a few refugees who would be coming from the western part of Poland especially those Jews who were exiled from Germany who came from Poland and somehow they didn't stay long enough in the western part of Poland and they kept on moving and settled down in our place in Louve.</span> <span id="s62">This was in '39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they came the German Jews in thousands and settled down in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did you work in the winery?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s67">We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our enterprise, or the winery, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't work.</span> <span id="s68">The only time I went to the cellar or to the winery is to see the process of making wine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists in the winemakers.</span> <span id="s69">They were there, of course, I recall we had a winery that took space a whole block because that whole block used to belong to us.</span> <span id="s70">Underneath in the cellar under the whole block was the whole winery.</span> <span id="s71">I recall that barrels where the wine was stored for aging was stacked four or five barrels stacked high.</span> <span id="s72">They were smaller.</span> <span id="s73">They were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the United States but I recall they were maybe 35 gallons.</span> <span id="s74">This was the standard barrel at that time to age honey wine.</span> <span id="s75">I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma contributed from the honey it was still there.</span> <span id="s76">But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and I don't know who took over our business.</span> <span id="s77">It could have been that my uncles had took it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: You lost your father when you were four years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Do you remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s82">There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old.</span> <span id="s83">He had a beautiful flag, eight or nine rooms and each room was designated for a certain purpose.</span> <span id="s84">Beside the bedroom and the dining room we had what we used to call salon which is a large area and we had a special reception place for certain events or for our friends of the family.</span> <span id="s85">So, we had a fairly large flag.</span> <span id="s86">My grandfather who actually brought me up because I lost my father when I was four, he used to live with us and my aunt Miriam she was a sister of my mother and we stayed together.</span> <span id="s87">That was my family, the immediate family.</span> <span id="s88">Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my aunt Miriam and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s89">My grandfather brought me up.</span> <span id="s90">He was in a way a philosopher on his own.</span> <span id="s91">He was a self taught mathematician.</span> <span id="s92">He was a true philosopher.</span> <span id="s93">Not only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own mind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights.</span> <span id="s94">He would get up in the morning four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s95">I knew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing.</span> <span id="s96">Whenever he woke up he would start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any coughing any more.</span> <span id="s97">So, he did traditional things with him.</span> <span id="s98">He would get up and go to our synagogue.</span> <span id="s99">We used to call it a ____________.</span> <span id="s100">He would stay there until from four to seven, seven thirty and by that time he would come home and wake us up and go and prepare ourselves to go to school.</span> <span id="s101">My grandfather, he was very helpful.</span> <span id="s102">He actually prepared me for my bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s103">He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of course other languages like Polish and Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s104">But his special language was Hebrew and German.</span> <span id="s105">By profession he was a printer.</span> <span id="s106">He came from ____________ which is south of Louve.</span> <span id="s107">He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in Romania.</span> <span id="s108">I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister, but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from _______________ which is from Romania, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's side that they live in Romania.</span> <span id="s109">He had a good life what I recalled even though it was difficult from a national point of view, but it was close.</span> <span id="s110">We were one family.</span> <span id="s111">We had a good rapport and a good relationship with our uncles.</span> <span id="s112">The other brewery in ___________ that was right across our street so we had a major industrial park if you will of breweries.</span> <span id="s113">It was the Isaac Brewery and there was the ___________ Brewery and then there was a ___________ Brewery and we were all together in it.</span> <span id="s114">It was good.</span> <span id="s115">I recall the way we were distributing our wine to different stores.</span> <span id="s116">We had a wagon and horses and we would be delivering wine so often.</span> <span id="s117">I used to like to go to the barn and every so often just to be together with the horses.</span> <span id="s118">So, the whole ___________ where we used to live, we used to live on _______________ which is a normal whole block that compares with any block in the United States, it was all one brewery.</span> <span id="s119">We were sort of like a corner house which was a three story corner house that borders on _____________ and _______________.</span> <span id="s120">That was the main road in the Louve that carried on for a number of miles.</span> <span id="s121">The ______________ is sort of almost like a district, an area where Jews used to live.</span> <span id="s122">It was a dominant area for Jewish life.</span> <span id="s123">It had many synagogues.</span> <span id="s124">In all, the Jewish people used to congregate right there.</span> <span id="s125">I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but there are basically, it was the majority in _______________.</span> <span id="s126">The minority in that area were mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles.</span> <span id="s127">There were more Ukrainians in our area than there were Poles.</span> <span id="s128">This is not to say that this was typical for ____________.</span> <span id="s129">In our area it was typical.</span> <span id="s130">The main activity in ______________ was on Friday where all the peasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly.</span> <span id="s131">We had a farmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce.</span> <span id="s132">The potatoes for winter time.</span> <span id="s133">The cabbages, all that stuff because _______________ was the main outlet for those farmers.</span> <span id="s134">Of course, we were doing also business at the same time.</span> <span id="s135">They were also purchasing wine.</span> <span id="s136">It wasn't a trade off.</span> <span id="s137">It was just a matter you would be buying for a certain period of time.</span> <span id="s138">My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but for the groceries she would go to a special store where it would specialize in Jewish food.</span> <span id="s139">It was a vibrant area for Jews to live.</span> <span id="s140">It was very interesting and when the market the farmer's market was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would see everything was depleted.</span> <span id="s141">The whole area was quiet because Friday night we would be going to synagogue, so the area was depleted.</span> <span id="s142">Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was still kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping.</span> <span id="s143">So the whole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much quieter.</span> <span id="s144">Although the Jewish life continued.</span> <span id="s145">When the life in those days and I'm saying '38 and '39 was quite active it was also troublesome.</span> <span id="s146">Because we wouldn't be completely free of any problems.</span> <span id="s147">Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our lives.</span> <span id="s148">The rumors were obviously of what happened in Germany and what happened in some other countries like in Romania or Russia although we knew very little of Russia but there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that affected us automatically.</span> <span id="s149">There was a movement in Polish society to promote the anti‑semitism.</span> <span id="s150">There was a part of that and anti‑semitism was very dominant already in Louve and it was moving toward the end that we were worried.</span> <span id="s151">We didn't know whether we had to take any action.</span> <span id="s152">In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming.</span> <span id="s153">In 1939 it was a year that we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out.</span> <span id="s154">I don't remember _____________ other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where the _______________ was bombarded.</span> <span id="s155">All the houses, one bomb hit our house.</span> <span id="s156">We were then in our basement, actually in the cellar was where the winery was, but we no longer had the winery but we had the cellar.</span> <span id="s157">A bomb hit just a part of our house, just a part of it, but it wasthe damage was done not directly to our houses in general, but the staircase, for example, which were concrete staircases, were they were marked and there were some splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was damage in it already.</span> <span id="s158">When we were in the cellar we had some other friends and some people were in the cellar and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while that I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage.</span> <span id="s159">We didn't see any fire.</span> <span id="s160">Nothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some other buildings that were attached to our house and we checked that and I remember my brother said well, there's not much damage to our hiding place.</span> <span id="s161">So, that I recall that we were hit by a bomb.</span> <span id="s162">Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the beginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that Poland was divided into two major areas with the lights somewhere west of Louve and the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s163">This was a new era that we began.</span> <span id="s164">The Russians occupied the eastern part of ____________ and __________ was part of that territory.</span> <span id="s165">I recall when the tanks were rolling down from ____________ coming from ______________ and they were huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge tanks and apparently they didn't have to fight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate area.</span> <span id="s166">If they were they were somewhere else.</span> <span id="s167">So, there was no conquest to be bragged about.</span> <span id="s168">They kept on moving, and they occupied _______________ and our immediate lifestyle had not changed other than that in the next few weeks there was a proclamation of I think it was in a few weeks that all the major homes and businesses were confiscated and we had a new regime and so on.</span> <span id="s169">This was the Soviet territory.</span> <span id="s170">So that means that our house no longer belonged to us.</span> <span id="s171">And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because this was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with money for the loans we had incurred some years ago.</span> <span id="s172">So, that was a relief in a way.</span> <span id="s173">The big question was how do you make a living.</span> <span id="s174">My mother didn't see how her facial with the army showed that she was concerned about those things.</span> <span id="s175">Eli was basically two years older than I was.</span> <span id="s176">He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to find himself, and he tried different approaches.</span> <span id="s177">He didn't feel like going to the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s178">He never cared for that.</span> <span id="s179">My older brother Abe was concerned because he was one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the intelligencias for reasons that I don't understand.</span> <span id="s180">They would put them in prison which was onI recall that prison being called ______________.</span> <span id="s181">Whether they were arrested or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at home.</span> <span id="s182">During that period of time, 1939 and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as Eli.</span> <span id="s183">I continued to study.</span> <span id="s184">I continued to go to school, the gymnasium until that time.</span> <span id="s185">The subjects my studies were now basically new.</span> <span id="s186">First of all since Jewishthis was a Jewish gymnasium, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s187">That was a surprise.</span> <span id="s188">In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with the Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay.</span> <span id="s189">My mother also makes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language.</span> <span id="s190">She used to, back in '39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English.</span> <span id="s191">I was better in English than I was in French.</span> <span id="s192">That's how I picked up some of my English language.</span> <span id="s193">But in the Jewish gymnasium we picked up two more languages and I was quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew alphabet.</span> <span id="s194">You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it.</span> <span id="s195">In the Russian language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware of that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that we picked up two more languages.</span> <span id="s196">The life under the Russians don't have too many bad recollections other than that during that period of time more since Poland was divided into two areas, the German area which is the line, quite a few refugees were coming more so from the western part of Poland to our area.</span> <span id="s197">Of course the Germans occupied the western Poland so they were directly under the German authority.</span> <span id="s198">And Jews were fleeing from that area.</span> <span id="s199">I recall that in my class in ____________ we received at least three German students one was from ____________, one was from Berlin, two were from Berlin and one from ______________.</span> <span id="s200">And there was another fellow who was also a student.</span> <span id="s201">He was from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s202">I don't know he escaped probably from Czechoslovakia, but not Czechoslovakia per se.</span> <span id="s203">He was from the Bohemia part that was occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s204">He escaped into Poland and then to the western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s205">He came to us to the Russian occupied part.</span> <span id="s206">In all, they were very jolly fellows.</span> <span id="s207">I was 14 or 15 at that time and of course the fellows from Berlin they tried to speak either Polish or Russian and they had a horrible accent and they just couldn't get through because their Russian language and the German language they just don't put together.</span> <span id="s208">They used to pronounce things in German that the pronunciation it was funny for us to listen to them, but the were wonderful fellows, very, very good boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No, they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family escaped Germany to Poland so there were no problems with the family and they hardly spoke about any events that involved them.</span> <span id="s211">They were boys.</span> <span id="s212">They were my age.</span> <span id="s213">They were more interested in soccer games.</span> <span id="s214">They were more interested in learning the language, how to deal with us because we were actually ____________ and they were the Germans so we were basicallythey were not even of Jewish nature.</span> <span id="s215">We were Jews.</span> <span id="s216">We knew the Hebrew.</span> <span id="s217">We knew the laws.</span> <span id="s218">They were not that much involved.</span> <span id="s219">They didn't care about that.</span> <span id="s220">Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives.</span> <span id="s221">We were not frightened to bring them into our way of life.</span> <span id="s222">They had their way of life.</span> <span id="s223">So, they did not mention anything of their event.</span> <span id="s224">The refugees who were coming in more and more from the western part, from Poland, we felt that we better slowly but surely being overwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the western part of Poland was just bad.</span> <span id="s225">They were claiming that the concentration camps are being established.</span> <span id="s226">they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on.</span> <span id="s227">We thought in ___________ because we knew about persecution that persecutionbecause we didn't have the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the Ukraine, but these were true persecutions they were telling us.</span> <span id="s228">We didn't understand what a concentration camp means.</span> <span id="s229">It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that.</span> <span id="s230">It wasn't a part that he would accept that, it just wasn't acceptable.</span> <span id="s231">We didn't know what people would do in concentration camp let alone the establishment and how do you so things people ignored that part.</span> <span id="s232">But as they were coming, more by thousands, the shed that we used to have at home, we have opened up, the salon and the special section room.</span> <span id="s233">We gave it up for them to dwell on it, to live in there.</span> <span id="s234">We had a large kitchen and we offered them everything we had.</span> <span id="s235">They stayed with us.</span> <span id="s236">Some of them took to work.</span> <span id="s237">Some of them moved out on their own, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who came who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left some other people back home wherever their home was.</span> <span id="s238">There was quite a few from _____________, from Warsaw fromI don't recall the small towns in the western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s239">So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a knock at the door, we had a big house in ____________.</span> <span id="s240">It was the Russians came in and they forced themselves into our place and they basically took all of these refugees.</span> <span id="s241">That was traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major expulsion of the refugees from ________________ to Russia.</span> <span id="s242">And we befriended some people there, so we were not far away from the main station.</span> <span id="s243">I run into that, and they put them in boxcars and a cattle trains, cars and they were locked up over there.</span> <span id="s244">That's how they were going to transport them from _______________ to east to Russia.</span> <span id="s245">We couldn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s246">I knew they were crying, really crying.</span> <span id="s247">What did they do wrong?</span> <span id="s248">These were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the Jews.</span> <span id="s249">They didn't kill them, but they put them away.</span> <span id="s250">We found out later that they were sent to ____________ and to different parts of Russia.</span> <span id="s251">I never met them again.</span> <span id="s252">Life in ________________ continued after that expulsion until another war broke out and that was in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded ________________.</span> <span id="s253">Can we stop for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: So when the Germans occupied ________________ there was a part that we didn'twhen I saw we, I'm talking about the family.</span> <span id="s257">The family, my mother or my brothers and I was just a boy listening to what's happening, what surrounds us.</span> <span id="s258">We were concerned yet there wasn't much that we could have done even though that it would be an immediate danger.</span> <span id="s259">Our immediate danger would have been from the local people that we would be threatened by.</span> <span id="s260">As I mentioned before we lived in _______________, which the majority of people were actually Jewish people, but also the minority were the Ukrainians and Poles.</span> <span id="s261">We were not quite sure how to take it, what really happened, although we heard a lot that the Germans are very threatening people.</span> <span id="s262">We soon found out that the first few weeks in Louve after the German occupation of Louve, there were quite a few robberies and personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s263">Some of them were maybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out.</span> <span id="s264">It was very dangerous to walk on the street.</span> <span id="s265">Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow the Jews to walk after certain hours, evening.</span> <span id="s266">That was maybe just as good, but the problem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main robberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began.</span> <span id="s267">It was the night first 1:00, then 2:00, then 3:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s268">They would rush into the house and if they couldn't find anything, they would destroy or maim people.</span> <span id="s269">Only during the night could you hear the night cries, the night help rescue, seeking help.</span> <span id="s270">This was horrible right during the night.</span> <span id="s271">We, at home we were basically safe because on the first floor we had a tenant that used to live and apparently he was a ___________.</span> <span id="s272">He was half German and half Polish, I think.</span> <span id="s273">They occupied that level and they actually controlled the gate, not that he would help us directly but people know that somebody'sSnyder I think was his name, he lived in that house, so we were basically protected.</span> <span id="s274">But you could hear at night the horrible screams being robbed and maimed and so on.</span> <span id="s275">It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better because every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point and I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the premises, the homes, where we used to live, and move into a small ghetto that was _________________.</span> <span id="s276">To find a dwelling and to move out, and we didn't have that much time.</span> <span id="s277">The furniture, the paintings, the rugs that we had, some of that Snyder took in his possession.</span> <span id="s278">He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them.</span> <span id="s279">All the beautiful paintings my father bought in Vienna, and the rugs.</span> <span id="s280">It's immaterial now, but at that time it meant a lot to us.</span> <span id="s281">So, we moved out with a basic one couch and some of the belongings that we had from the whole flat.</span> <span id="s282">It was my mother, myself, I'm not sure if Eli was there.</span> <span id="s283">My oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer with us.</span> <span id="s284">He was taken away just before we moved out to that small ghetto.</span> <span id="s285">He apparently went to a hospital to get some medicine.</span> <span id="s286">He never came back.</span> <span id="s287">He had to go downtown to where later on it became the major ghetto.</span> <span id="s288">It seems to me it was close to the _____________ ghetto.</span> <span id="s289">He went there and he never came back.</span> <span id="s290">We didn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s291">We heard that later on one hospital was emptied by Gestapo or by people who worked with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s292">They took them away.</span> <span id="s293">I'm not quite sure when _______________ was established.</span> <span id="s294">____________ wasn't even at that time a bad word.</span> <span id="s295">But we heard ______________.</span> <span id="s296">______________ is an area where Jews were killed and it was adjacent to _______________ camp.</span> <span id="s297">But we heard that word ______________.</span> <span id="s298">So, he was not with us.</span> <span id="s299">Eli was in and out of our area, our home.</span> <span id="s300">Not quite sure what he was doing.</span> <span id="s301">I'm sure he was trying to survive, trying to find some angles to get out of a bad situation.</span> <span id="s302">We moved out to that small ghetto.</span> <span id="s303">A secretary to our business who used to be our secretary, she used to live in that area, in that small ghetto in a free standing home and she offered her house to my mother.</span> <span id="s304">I don't know the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a house to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an area because you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one area to another area where you have a comparable exchange of dwellings.</span> <span id="s305">It wa questionable, but we had it.</span> <span id="s306">With our house in that free standing house and I recall there were maybe three rooms perhaps and there was another family that moved in with us.</span> <span id="s307">Now, it was a period of time that we acclimated ourselves into this new ghetto.</span> <span id="s308">The faces that we didn't know before all of a sudden we knew them very well.</span> <span id="s309">They were all Jews.</span> <span id="s310">The way I understand that a Jewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the ghetto and our _______________ ghetto.</span> <span id="s311">We were not much concerned with them, other than there was another area that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to us.</span> <span id="s312">We all of a sudden have a new life in a new ghetto, new people, new surroundings.</span> <span id="s313">The future, who knows what it's going to bring.</span> <span id="s314">The rumors were actually in that ghetto that those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you better have a place to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that will help you survive.</span> <span id="s315">Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the point where you had to survive somehow not knowing of camps or anything of that that we are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives.</span> <span id="s316">That didn't grasp yet.</span> <span id="s317">We weren't involved in that.</span> <span id="s318">We were involved mostly in our personal belonging, in our personal lifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a human being.</span> <span id="s319">The ghetto didn't mean to us that this was the end of our line.</span> <span id="s320">It was perhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s321">You were not directly confronted with the physical abuse, the physical maiming of people.</span> <span id="s322">The rumors were you better get work.</span> <span id="s323">That was in '41.</span> <span id="s324">I was 16 years old, and I wasn'tdidn't know where to find work.</span> <span id="s325">Where do you find work in ghetto and I run across a friend of mine who told me that there is a place on _____________ Street whoand they called it ____________ that they're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough.</span> <span id="s326">I didn't know what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into.</span> <span id="s327">I went back to my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for some workers and whether she would allow me to go interview.</span> <span id="s328">My mother didn't think that she objected other than she warned me be careful.</span> <span id="s329">I went there.</span> <span id="s330">I went to ____________.</span> <span id="s331">They called it later on __________________.</span> <span id="s332">______________ is a factory or was a factory that made tar paper for the roofs and the way they were doing is you roll out a three foot section of paper and you dunk it into asphalt.</span> <span id="s333">Later you roll it out and there are some people who were using dry sand and covering the wet asphalt and that becomes a tar paper.</span> <span id="s334">What they were looking for workers who could carry balls of paper 75 to 80 kilos of paper to go from one place, say from a truck to the depot that they had right in the back, or storage place, and I wasn't sure that I could do that, but if that meant to have an i.d. and be protected I better do it.</span> <span id="s335">I walked into the office and told them that I would like this work if they could have me.</span> <span id="s336">There was man called Fessel.</span> <span id="s337">He was a Jew from Slazia, it was in Poland, and he looked at me and close to him there was a foreman, a Polish foreman.</span> <span id="s338">I forget his name and he asked me can you use this young fellow and he says yes I can only if he can carry that ball.</span> <span id="s339">He took me out and tested me out, and he selected the largest ball, 75 kilos.</span> <span id="s340">Every ball was numbered and I picked it up and I carried it and I dropped it the place where he wanted me to drop it and he hired me on the spot.</span> <span id="s341">You can work with us.</span> <span id="s342">It was basically not a relief for me other than that I felt that I'm employable.</span> <span id="s343">I went back home told my mom that I have a job and maybe we'll be more secure.</span> <span id="s344">From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working every day with them going back from ghetto to ______________ or ______________.</span> <span id="s345">It's maybe a 20 minute walk, maybe 30 minutes.</span> <span id="s346">So, at that time, I was going back and forth and my mother all day long I would be working and evening I would be coming home.</span> <span id="s347">At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the place I used to work, like tomatoes and maybe bread although we could buy some bread but we were rationed in ghetto.</span> <span id="s348">So, it was helpful.</span> <span id="s349">I don't recall at what point they have established living quarters in ________________.</span> <span id="s350">It was some time later thanI'm trying to recall something which I'm not quite at ease with me.</span> <span id="s351">Let me say the time sometime in August of 19it was in '42 already.</span> <span id="s352">I did work a number of months.</span> <span id="s353">It seems to me going back from ghetto to _________________ and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I cannot recall.</span> <span id="s354">The image that comes to my mind now is August the action.</span> <span id="s355">We called it ____________, where that small ghetto in _______________ was basically almost evacuated.</span> <span id="s356">Practically all the Jews were taken and I was at that time in ________________.</span> <span id="s357">_____________ was located on Żółkiewska Street.</span> <span id="s358">The main entrance was from ____________ which was the main thorough between north and south.</span> <span id="s359">And it was the area which would be within a couple blocks of where my home used to be, a couple blocks from my uncle's it used to be and so on.</span> <span id="s360">There was a time I recall when the action came about in the ____________ ghetto and it was close to evening.</span> <span id="s361">Somebody rushed into the factory one of our workers.</span> <span id="s362">They were moving them out to the street.</span> <span id="s363">We moved out, I moved out immediately to the gate to see what we wanted to see.</span> <span id="s364">We saw what we didn't want to see, thousands and thousands of ghetto people were moving and going to _______________ Street.</span> <span id="s365">I looked and I saw some of my friends.</span> <span id="s366">My friends, dear friends that I used to play with.</span> <span id="s367">Some acquaintances.</span> <span id="s368">I was looking for my mother.</span> <span id="s369">I didn't see her, didn't find her.</span> <span id="s370">It was maybe twenty rows and miles of people.</span> <span id="s371">They were slowly marching.</span> <span id="s372">They were guarded by Ukrainian _______________.</span> <span id="s373">I didn't see any Germans.</span> <span id="s374">Maybe in the back, but I didn't see them.</span> <span id="s375">Mostly Ukrainian on each side.</span> <span id="s376">I didn't see the front either.</span> <span id="s377">I came right in the middle.</span> <span id="s378">I didn't see the beginning the march, I didn't see the end of the march.</span> <span id="s379">I just kept on seeing the area where it was visible to me from that narrow gate.</span> <span id="s380">They didn't see me.</span> <span id="s381">I saw them because the gate was actually locked, the _____________ gate.</span> <span id="s382">It was going on for hours and hours because there was a slow march.</span> <span id="s383">Finally it ended.</span> <span id="s384">People were looking from the windows because all _______________ was inhabited by Ukrainians and Poles, second third stories, they're all looking at them.</span> <span id="s385">It was a very grim sight.</span> <span id="s386">I don't recallit was the following day that I decided to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s387">Although they warned me not to go, they I mean Fessel and the director of the factory.</span> <span id="s388">At that point in time I did already have my i.d., the identification card.</span> <span id="s389">I don't recall whether I had to wear a band or not.</span> <span id="s390">I probably did, but I don't recall that.</span> <span id="s391">But I got into ghetto because I wanted to see what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s392">I rushed into the house.</span> <span id="s393">The house was empty but the hiding place where we had the hiding place for my mother was a couch.</span> <span id="s394">A couch consisted of a frame and on top of the frame there was this soft part which is the couch.</span> <span id="s395">You couldn't tell whether that couch was separate for anyone else it was one part.</span> <span id="s396">The frame and the couch, the upper part was one unit.</span> <span id="s397">That's why when there was any action, my mother would be hiding there.</span> <span id="s398">I would make sure of that.</span> <span id="s399">When I got home, the upper part was moved so I was scared of that.</span> <span id="s400">When I cried out for my mother she came to life.</span> <span id="s401">She was there.</span> <span id="s402">She was on the inside of the couch so even it was moved, she was in that area.</span> <span id="s403">She was wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blanket.</span> <span id="s404">So even though they were looking for her, they didn't find her.</span> <span id="s405">She was there, so we had our moment, with my mother.</span> <span id="s406">A number of weeks went by before another action came about.</span> <span id="s407">I think during that action I lost my mother, and I don't know how they got her.</span> <span id="s408">So, she was gone.</span> <span id="s409">Eli was gone, Abe was gone.</span> <span id="s410">It was a part of that they have then decided to establish a living quarters, I think, on the premises of __________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Can I ask you something before we get to the living quarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: What happened to your grandfather and Miriam?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: My grandfather died during the Russian time.</span> <span id="s415">He diedI don't recall but it was during the Russian occupation and he was buried in a grave yard.</span> <span id="s416">We felt that this was a very timely death for my grandfather to die, not to see everything.</span> <span id="s417">But it was definitely during the Russian occupation that we were not harassed at that time.</span> <span id="s418">Aunt Miriam she stayed with us.</span> <span id="s419">Aunt Miriam did not have a good rapport with my mother, but at the time of that bad time, they changed their minds or they have relaxed their anger or whatever it was, they were back together, at least on a talking basis.</span> <span id="s420">If I recall, she moved with us to the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s421">At what point she was taken I don't recall.</span> <span id="s422">But I don't recall her that much although I really liked her.</span> <span id="s423">She was one of the intellegencias, but she was a strange person to many eyes, but not to me.</span> <span id="s424">I was her favorite, but what happened to her, I don't know.</span> <span id="s425">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s426">Whether she was taken, the action I don't know because from there on I did not see her.</span> <span id="s427">I don't recall where she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Tell me something about Eli and your family?</span> <span id="s429">Were you angry at him for not sticking with your mother at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No.</span> <span id="s431">Eli was very special to me.</span> <span id="s432">He was 17, 18 at that time and he had his own friends.</span> <span id="s433">He had many girlfriends.</span> <span id="s434">He always looking for money.</span> <span id="s435">He needed money.</span> <span id="s436">I was more of a family son.</span> <span id="s437">I was closer to my mother and assuring that everything was under control and Eli was not the opposite of me and he wasn't completely with me as I would like him to be.</span> <span id="s438">Abe was completely different.</span> <span id="s439">He was much older than we were.</span> <span id="s440">He was ten years older.</span> <span id="s441">He had his own friends.</span> <span id="s442">He had very little to do with us.</span> <span id="s443">He would want to talk to me other than in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s444">He despised Polish language, so he would only speak Hebrew to me, and I had to respond to him also in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s445">Although my Hebrew wasn't that good, but I carried on a conversation with him.</span> <span id="s446">It was something that I wanted to impress my brother Abe at one point in time there was a Serbian or Yugoslavian king or Rumanian king that abdicated sometime in 1938 and I tried to tell him this in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s447">I don't know whether he responded to me, but this was the time I recall an event that I tried to impress and I wanted his assurance.</span> <span id="s448">Abe was a little bit on the snobbish side because he was always with his friends talking about zionism, talking about the world's affairs.</span> <span id="s449">He tried to settle all the world's affairs.</span> <span id="s450">Eli was completely different from both of us.</span> <span id="s451">He was more or like a happy go lucky fellow.</span> <span id="s452">He wanted to live now not tomorrow.</span> <span id="s453">Now is the day.</span> <span id="s454">Since he didn't have that much, he would take certain things from home and sell it to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with him.</span> <span id="s455">I wasn't angry with him, but I tried to preserve things that the family had.</span> <span id="s456">He understood that very well, but he was my favorite brother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used to give me some secrets and at night he used to take me outside the house and we would be smoking.</span> <span id="s457">So, I kept things in secret.</span> <span id="s458">He was very good natured, though.</span> <span id="s459">He cared about us.</span> <span id="s460">Now, Eli was taken away from us some time.</span> <span id="s461">I really don't know when.</span> <span id="s462">He was taken away from that small ghetto.</span> <span id="s463">Now I heard that Eli was in concentration camp in _________________.</span> <span id="s464">We weren't sure that this was a death camp, but it was very fearsome place to be in.</span> <span id="s465">The fact that we heard that ____________ and people are being killed there.</span> <span id="s466">Even though that I heard that Eli is there, I felt always that when Eli is in a tight spot he always will get out.</span> <span id="s467">At least I hoped so.</span> <span id="s468">When ____________ established the living quarters, I was one of them.</span> <span id="s469">We were a crew of 40 Jews only men.</span> <span id="s470">It was a place where we felt was a very safe place at least for the time being.</span> <span id="s471">Even it was safe place that we had within the 40 people there were certain groups that were more confined with each other than others.</span> <span id="s472">Probably psychologists would love to study those groups.</span> <span id="s473">I was basically with a group of boys my age.</span> <span id="s474">The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do we get some cigarettes.</span> <span id="s475">That was the main thing at that time.</span> <span id="s476">The ghetto was gone.</span> <span id="s477">There was nothing that I can do any more in ghetto.</span> <span id="s478">I didn't want to go anymore there.</span> <span id="s479">As a matter of fact it was a Jew free area.</span> <span id="s480">The only thing that was dominant was actually the downtown ghetto on _____________ Street and ______________ Street.</span> <span id="s481">That was the area.</span> <span id="s482">I did not know too much about things that surrounded us because we were confined in a given area and the only thing that we heard was the rumors that would come in.</span> <span id="s483">Even papers didn't come in.</span> <span id="s484">We didn't have any papers.</span> <span id="s485">So, the 40 Jews, even though we were together, they had such secrets.</span> <span id="s486">I didn't know what the secrets were.</span> <span id="s487">I learned later on apparently they built an extra wall.</span> <span id="s488">There was a basement where we used to live.</span> <span id="s489">On top there was the factory and the basement was the living quarters and in that basement they erected a wall which was done sometime probably before the action in August.</span> <span id="s490">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s491">Nobody let me know that.</span> <span id="s492">So, a lot of thingsin a way I was a little angry that they didn't let me know that because I could have brought in my mother, into the hiding place.</span> <span id="s493">It was a hiding place.</span> <span id="s494">It was a whole wall and in that false wall, false partition, it was covered with wood, piles of cut wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00 they would remove the wood and people would walk out for fresh air.</span> <span id="s495">Even at that time I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s496">I found that out later.</span> <span id="s497">When I was living in time where maybe I was too ambivalent, to naive of knowing what was going on.</span> <span id="s498">But, they were Jews.</span> <span id="s499">Families of some of these 40 people and when I learned later on that there is a hiding place and I just hoped that Eli would be alive so I could bring him here.</span> <span id="s500">My work at that factory consisted of working first with the bales, carrying the bales and sometimes just dusting the asphalt with the dry sand.</span> <span id="s501">But then later on since I liked so much horses, we had a wagon there with horses that we would transport asphalt into the factory.</span> <span id="s502">There was one fellow who was we used to call the foreman.</span> <span id="s503">He took care of the horses and the wagon and he would transport the goods, certain asphalt and some of them he would bring also some sand to the factory.</span> <span id="s504">His name was _____________.</span> <span id="s505">And he selected me to be his helper to care for the horses and so on.</span> <span id="s506">I really enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s507">I'd rather work with horses than work in the factory.</span> <span id="s508">The foreman of the factory liked also bunnies, rabbits.</span> <span id="s509">He had a cage of rabbits in the stall in the barn and he asked me to take care of them.</span> <span id="s510">So, I had the horses now and I had the rabbits and I used to take care of them.</span> <span id="s511">It was pleasant.</span> <span id="s512">I liked to work with animals and at the same time I was the helper of _____________.</span> <span id="s513">I used to call him _________.</span> <span id="s514">He was a very nice fellow.</span> <span id="s515">A very straightforward fellow.</span> <span id="s516">He was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s517">He did not see me as a Jew.</span> <span id="s518">I was Wilek to him and he was _____________ to me.</span> <span id="s519">I didn't care that he was Ukrainian even though that I knew that the Ukrainians killed Jews and abused Jews and vice versa.</span> <span id="s520">He saw me as Wilek, a fellow.</span> <span id="s521">So, he was very nice to me, he was human.</span> <span id="s522">We liked each other.</span> <span id="s523">So, I was his assistant in doing anything that the factory needed, to take care of.</span> <span id="s524">Caring for the animals but also transporting asphalt.</span> <span id="s525">This was going on for a number of months.</span> <span id="s526">Now, I had an opportunity to go out of the factory with him and see what was going on.</span> <span id="s527">Now, when I drove with him on the wagon, I did not have a band, I don't think so because I was part of the ___________________.</span> <span id="s528">So, we used to drive oh maybe a kilometer or so to get the asphalt.</span> <span id="s529">We had a refinery not far from us within a kilometer or so.</span> <span id="s530">And that refinery there was an area where there was a refinery, there was also a slaughter house for animals.</span> <span id="s531">In that refinery, the bi product of the refinery is asphalt and they would pour out the byproduct into an area, a depleted area a narrow area not too deep and what we would be doing is we would be cutting them in blocks because they were solid and carry them on top of the wagon and bring them back to the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: So we used to bring the asphalt back to the factory and of course in the process of asphalt being liquified later on in huge ovens and that's how we get the process of that tar onto the paper.</span> <span id="s535">That was my work in _______________, working with ___________ day in and day out.</span> <span id="s536">We were able to drive from our factory to maybe two or three different streets, and of course at that time Louve, that area any way, was already Jew free.</span> <span id="s537">There were no Jews there anymore.</span> <span id="s538">Perhaps some were hidden, but there were no visible Jews.</span> <span id="s539">The place was basically very quiet.</span> <span id="s540">It wasn't vibrant as it used to be the times that I recall back in '38 and '39.</span> <span id="s541">We were doing this a number of months and Peter and I we were very much befriended.</span> <span id="s542">We were talking about at times that it could happen that one of these days they will take me away.</span> <span id="s543">The discussion was how do I survive.</span> <span id="s544">How do I get out of this place.</span> <span id="s545">I did not have good moves ahead of me.</span> <span id="s546">I did not see too many visions, what is a good way of doing it.</span> <span id="s547">In back of our factory there were tracks and those tracks you could see every so often Hungarian troops going somewhere and the thought that came to my mind, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some Hungarian language and just jumped in the cart and said hey, I'm one of you.</span> <span id="s548">But it was just a dream.</span> <span id="s549">Back with Peter, I told Peter what's a good way of surviving.</span> <span id="s550">He didn't give me a good answer.</span> <span id="s551">One day he came and told me, you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wife.</span> <span id="s552">I thanked him for the offer or his thoughts.</span> <span id="s553">We had a farmer that would deliver some produce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours.</span> <span id="s554">He looked me up in ________________, and he told me that if you need a place come to us.</span> <span id="s555">So, in that preparation I was very glad that he offered me a place to hide because I was at his house back on the farm a number of years ago, a number of times on my vacation.</span> <span id="s556">He would take me in to ____________.</span> <span id="s557">He had great piergos, it's dumplings with good stuffing.</span> <span id="s558">His wife used to make.</span> <span id="s559">I used to ride on the horses with him and take care of his cows.</span> <span id="s560">It was just fun for me to do that at that time.</span> <span id="s561">So, he came back, and he looked me up and he offered me, I had hope.</span> <span id="s562">There's a place to go.</span> <span id="s563">I had a duffle bag, a leather duffle bag and I put in some of my clothing, some of my things for him to have it just in case I do get to escape and get to his place.</span> <span id="s564">So, at least I have a place to go.</span> <span id="s565">Meanwhile I was working with Peter.</span> <span id="s566">Because I wasn't sure where his farm was, I knew but I really didn't know where his farm was, and one day, Peter looks at me and says Wilek come over here.</span> <span id="s567">Do you see this lady?</span> <span id="s568">There was a lady that was limping that was going to the office.</span> <span id="s569">I said yes I see her.</span> <span id="s570">I remember her.</span> <span id="s571">I remember her well.</span> <span id="s572">He told me that he delivered a wagon of potatoes there.</span> <span id="s573">That was some time early part of 1943 that he delivered a wagon of potatoes.</span> <span id="s574">It was a custom to buy potatoes in huge quantities for winter time and so on.</span> <span id="s575">That was the way we did that in Louve.</span> <span id="s576">I asked him what makes him think that she's the one.</span> <span id="s577">I mean how do I know.</span> <span id="s578">I don't know but remember her and I'll give you an address that in case something happens here, you go there.</span> <span id="s579">Because he felt at that time that the director Fessel is grooming her or grooming this place for him to hide.</span> <span id="s580">I took this as a good omen and I felt maybe he's got something there.</span> <span id="s581">It was a certain time within that period of time.</span> <span id="s582">It was just before the Warsaw ghetto that it was in April sometime that I remember that two partisansa partisan is a person who's a guerrilla warrior.</span> <span id="s583">They used to belong to a Polish underground, and they spoke to our leadership in __________ to join their partisan group.</span> <span id="s584">I'm not quite sure what transpired but I think our leadership rejected them.</span> <span id="s585">They didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s586">It was during that period of time that things are getting closer and closer of annihilation of the Jewish population in Louve.</span> <span id="s587">We knew about Warsaw and we knew they were fighting.</span> <span id="s588">We also knew that the downtown ghetto is getting tighter and tighter.</span> <span id="s589">Very few Jews you could see being escorted on the street, less and less because until that time you see a group escorted by the militia.</span> <span id="s590">People from ghetto to work from work back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s591">Of course we were stationary.</span> <span id="s592">The group of the 40 Jews.</span> <span id="s593">We were stationary.</span> <span id="s594">We live right then and but we see them once in a while and sometimes I saw on my wagon these groups going back and forth.</span> <span id="s595">I mentioned before this slaughter house and there was one Jew who used to work there and as we were cutting the asphalt and that Jew across the field would look and wave to me and I would go there talk to him and ask him what his business was while he goes back and forth from the slaughter house back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s596">But at the same time, he offered me some meat to take it with me so I would bring that meat back home.</span> <span id="s597">Home meaning my ____________ people.</span> <span id="s598">I would bring that.</span> <span id="s599">Occasionally I would be going from ______________ to ghetto just to go there.</span> <span id="s600">I didn't have anyone there.</span> <span id="s601">Maybe I would be going with a friend of mine because he wanted to accompany, but I recall everytime I would be going there, I wouldn't be going there too often, but I was given an armband with a W letter which was for _____________ meaning that we were working for the ___________, the army, even though that manager of our factory was a captain in air force which doesn't make sense but that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s602">He apparently was very good, very good.</span> <span id="s603">A reasonable human being.</span> <span id="s604">He had an excellent rapport with Fessel.</span> <span id="s605">He was I think captain in the air force.</span> <span id="s606">He was the one who would warn us when major problems occurred.</span> <span id="s607">At one point, he would warn us that we were about to be picked up by the guards.</span> <span id="s608">We would move out.</span> <span id="s609">The way I dressed myselfI was dressed myself as a typical farmer.</span> <span id="s610">This is the way I could disguise myself the best, with long boots, with special boot type slacks.</span> <span id="s611">They're specially curved that the boot accepts the slacks and with a hat and a cigarette in my mouth.</span> <span id="s612">I used to roll my own cigarettes so I was a typical farmer.</span> <span id="s613">The first time that we were going to be picked up I just left.</span> <span id="s614">I had no where to go.</span> <span id="s615">Ghetto was opened.</span> <span id="s616">You could go in to ghetto but who wants to go into ghetto.</span> <span id="s617">So I went downtown on ______________ Street where I used to go with friends of mine and prominent the area when we used to be young boys and free of troubles.</span> <span id="s618">It was like three or four o'clock or two o'clock, something right afternoon that I ran off from ________________ and there was very little you could do downtown other than be picked up by Ukrainians or somebody who recognized me.</span> <span id="s619">I was not, but my safe thing was to do was go to a movie house, so I went to a movie house just to kill time.</span> <span id="s620">After that time thinking just a few minutes ahead, what am I going to do next?</span> <span id="s621">I didn't have the answer.</span> <span id="s622">I had to do things that were natural in that point in time.</span> <span id="s623">I saw a movie, another movie, it was newsreel of cutting.</span> <span id="s624">This was where the Germans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were killed.</span> <span id="s625">The Russians claimed that the Germans killed them.</span> <span id="s626">The Germans claim that the Russians killed them.</span> <span id="s627">This was the time that Saw that excerpt.</span> <span id="s628">I was all engrossed in that because for the first time I hear there was a cutting, there was a slaughter of Polish officers but from the German side.</span> <span id="s629">After the movie, I went out and I don't know what time it was but I saw a column of Jews were going to ghetto.</span> <span id="s630">I put my armband and I joined them.</span> <span id="s631">That is the only place that I can go right now short of being right down town without Jews.</span> <span id="s632">So, I joined them and I went over there to ghetto.</span> <span id="s633">There was probably a few weeks after the Warsaw ghetto or around that time.</span> <span id="s634">I knew that I had to do something very drastic soon, but didn't have the opportunity yet.</span> <span id="s635">I went back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s636">The ghetto was so crowded I did not feel so crowded in my life because that was the first time I was exposed to that.</span> <span id="s637">In other words, living in ________________ in my own bunk in the basement with only 40 Jews was a paradise from what I have seen over here.</span> <span id="s638">People were living in the street.</span> <span id="s639">Just a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s640">No clothing, torn clothing, and a lady that I recognized who used to live on the same street, she was a daughter of a grocer.</span> <span id="s641">A very pretty young lady, she was probably in her 30s, I think.</span> <span id="s642">She became a prostitute in ghetto.</span> <span id="s643">But she took me in immediately.</span> <span id="s644">She was my neighbor, and she gave me some slotties and I left went to another place to another friends, the same surroundings, and I walked into an area where some older young men were looking for how do you get out of ghetto.</span> <span id="s645">How do you join the partisans.</span> <span id="s646">And I was right in the midst of it.</span> <span id="s647">On suggestion was we get a whole group with the armbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort that group all the way down ____________ all the way down because nobody is going to ask where are you going with this Jewish group.</span> <span id="s648">That was one of the questions.</span> <span id="s649">The other question is where do you the uniforms.</span> <span id="s650">Where do you get the arms, and so forth.</span> <span id="s651">It was a round robin exercise, how to you survive yourself.</span> <span id="s652">The following day I got word that we are safe.</span> <span id="s653">In other words I could go back to _____________ and resume my work.</span> <span id="s654">I went back.</span> <span id="s655">I went back to _____________ and resumed the work, but now I felt very strong.</span> <span id="s656">It's only time before things happen.</span> <span id="s657">There was another major action sometime later, I forget when in '43, whether it was June or July, a major action and I was told that Eli was there.</span> <span id="s658">He returned that he knew about me and during the action this was on that day someone else was going to go to ghetto also because of action, rescuing someone.</span> <span id="s659">I joined them.</span> <span id="s660">I said I want to go with you.</span> <span id="s661">I went and I took an extra armband for Eli just in case I catch him.</span> <span id="s662">I went over there and they told me the address and I went to that place and there was a lady there, an empty house basically and asked her about Eli.</span> <span id="s663">She said he was here, but they picked him up.</span> <span id="s664">I came too late.</span> <span id="s665">I was downhearted.</span> <span id="s666">There was a place that very few people should be going through this exercise.</span> <span id="s667">As I was walking on the street, there was one fence there and I hear right on the other side of the fence, people were praying with a loud voice.</span> <span id="s668">During the action and I kept on walking because I had to get out of that area.</span> <span id="s669">They will pick me up but I was secure because I did have the armband and I had the W and I had the identification stamp.</span> <span id="s670">I forget the stamp.</span> <span id="s671">It was a swastika stamp and I think it was a red stamp which was the most recent stamp.</span> <span id="s672">So I was safe.</span> <span id="s673">I went through and I got the other people who went with me from _____________ and we made our exit in a hurry.</span> <span id="s674">At that time, I didn't see any buses anymore or any trucks anymore.</span> <span id="s675">They finished the action for the moment so we took our exit out.</span> <span id="s676">I went back to ______________.</span> <span id="s677">Eli was gone.</span> <span id="s678">They took him away.</span> <span id="s679">So there was nothing I can do at this point.</span> <span id="s680">He's gone.</span> <span id="s681">The whole family is gone as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s682">Now, a few months went by now and they were talking now about the liquidation of ghetto.</span> <span id="s683">I don't recall when they had liquidated the ghetto other than one point in time just prior that we were to be picked up they pronounced that Louve is Judenfrau, Jew free.</span> <span id="s684">No Jews live anymore in Louve.</span> <span id="s685">Now, the more I'm thinking from there on, I'm thinking more and more about this lady, the limping lady.</span> <span id="s686">Peter gave me that address and he told me exactly how to go there to get to that place.</span> <span id="s687">There was sometime in the morning, I forget when.</span> <span id="s688">It was a beautiful morning as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s689">The sun was out, nice and chilly.</span> <span id="s690">Whether it was September or October, I don't know.</span> <span id="s691">It was sometime in the fall one day we were told that 1:00 we would be picked up.</span> <span id="s692">Now, time was early in the morning, maybe eight, nine, ten.</span> <span id="s693">I don't know.</span> <span id="s694">I knew immediately that something is going on because Fessel and Horowitz they were all dressed up.</span> <span id="s695">They're ready to move out.</span> <span id="s696">They were not moving yet, but they were ready to move out.</span> <span id="s697">I didn't even try to look down in the basement what is going on regardless even though you have a hiding place, I wasn't about to stay there.</span> <span id="s698">I decided to go, to move because I didn't see any future in hiding in that place.</span> <span id="s699">Sooner or later, probably sooner than later we were going to be discovered, so I didn't take this place as a safe one.</span> <span id="s700">My point was is to get out.</span> <span id="s701">The question when, that is within an hour or so.</span> <span id="s702">I went to Peter.</span> <span id="s703">I said goodbye to him and I moved out.</span> <span id="s704">That was the last time I saw Peter.</span> <span id="s705">He wished me luck and I went out.</span> <span id="s706">I kept on walking.</span> <span id="s707">I don't remember all the streets that I went through, I just followed certain streets and I went through a place a main thorough and right on the street a friend of mine, well, not a friend but an acquaintance.</span> <span id="s708">A fellow I went to school with, to public school, Sayer his name was and he saw me.</span> <span id="s709">He looks at me.</span> <span id="s710">Of course he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my question is is he going to betray me.</span> <span id="s711">I didn't think so.</span> <span id="s712">He grabbed me and we went to a gate, to a house and I told him I need your help.</span> <span id="s713">What do you need?</span> <span id="s714">I said I need you to be here at a certain time, about three o'clock.</span> <span id="s715">I don't know what time it was then but there was plenty of time.</span> <span id="s716">I thought I'd need him to go to the station to get my ticket because I had my farmer in mind.</span> <span id="s717">But I was on my way to that lady.</span> <span id="s718">Just in case I didn't get any results there, I'd have a chance to go there and I needed him to help me out to buy a ticket, a train ticket.</span> <span id="s719">I wasn't sure how to buy it.</span> <span id="s720">I wasn't sure that part how to buy the ticket, but besides I needed his help anyway if he could offer me or at least not to betray me.</span> <span id="s721">He said I'll be here at 3:00.</span> <span id="s722">What else do you need.</span> <span id="s723">I told him I didn't need anything other than to help me to go through that period of that hour or two.</span> <span id="s724">I kept on walking.</span> <span id="s725">I didn't think that I would be betrayed by Sawyer.</span> <span id="s726">I didn't think so even though he was Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s727">So, I kept on walking and I went to that place.</span> <span id="s728">At first I didn't recognize the house because he described me a certain house but when I looked at those houses, they all looked the same.</span> <span id="s729">Across the field there was barracks where the Ukrainian militia used to live.</span> <span id="s730">There was an area where I felt well, you do or you don't.</span> <span id="s731">I went to one house and I askedher name was Maria, and I knocked at the door, is Maria home?</span> <span id="s732">The person says no Maria here.</span> <span id="s733">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s734">Then I went to another door.</span> <span id="s735">It must have been one of those houses so I went to another house.</span> <span id="s736">The next time and she opens the door.</span> <span id="s737">Maria was there.</span> <span id="s738">Now, Maria doesn't know me.</span> <span id="s739">I know Maria.</span> <span id="s740">She was limping.</span> <span id="s741">She was a good looking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish.</span> <span id="s742">I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel.</span> <span id="s743">She says no Fessel in this house.</span> <span id="s744">I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his workers is here.</span> <span id="s745">She says no Fessel is not here.</span> <span id="s746">I said okay.</span> <span id="s747">I took off.</span> <span id="s748">Maybe I was misled.</span> <span id="s749">I took this as a true sign I was misled my next option is to go to my farmer.</span> <span id="s750">I kept on tracing my steps back, the same way and I was going to see Sawyer.</span> <span id="s751">As I walked down I'd say a good half a mile down the road, I hear some hollering behind me.</span> <span id="s752">It was Maria with her limping legs was after me.</span> <span id="s753">She was hollering for me to stop.</span> <span id="s754">I finally stopped and went back, kept on walking towards her and she looked at me.</span> <span id="s755">You're so stupid and some other expletives.</span> <span id="s756">Come back with me.</span> <span id="s757">And probably I was stupid and she took me back and walked me right into this room in this house where Fessel was.</span> <span id="s758">Now, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name, how I got the address because if I could find them someone else could find them.</span> <span id="s759">Obviously true, Peter could find them.</span> <span id="s760">This was their main concern.</span> <span id="s761">They weren't concerned about me but about Peter.</span> <span id="s762">Peter as far as I have never seen him drunk.</span> <span id="s763">And Peter he was such a friend that he would never betray me.</span> <span id="s764">So there was no concern.</span> <span id="s765">I wasn't concerned, they were.</span> <span id="s766">The group consisted of Fessel and his brother.</span> <span id="s767">His brother was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain.</span> <span id="s768">He had a German overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow.</span> <span id="s769">It was Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got in there probably through a different route, but the route that I know how Fessel got into this house was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his personal secretary in ___________.</span> <span id="s770">So at least two people from our factory, his brother which I never saw him before, his lady friend.</span> <span id="s771">That lady friend was a sister of that other couple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he came about there.</span> <span id="s772">Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria.</span> <span id="s773">So we had like seven people there.</span> <span id="s774">I think there was seven, I was the eighth one.</span> <span id="s775">It was a time where they were concerned about their security because of Peter.</span> <span id="s776">The question was whether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place home and tell him no one was there.</span> <span id="s777">So, I could go and apparently go back home to their place to secure their hiding place.</span> <span id="s778">It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put me in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number of miles to his place.</span> <span id="s779">They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was more of a friend of mine than of theirs.</span> <span id="s780">They left it at that.</span> <span id="s781">So, now I was not one of them, but at least I was in a safe place for the time being.</span> <span id="s782">The area we were in one room I think maybe it was another room, but basically I was in the front in the large room that was together with this hiding family.</span> <span id="s783">We had a trap door to the basement which was not in the walking place but in a crawling space.</span> <span id="s784">We had a special area that was covered with a rock in case something happens we all go inside and hide ourself there.</span> <span id="s785">We had our food.</span> <span id="s786">Apparently Fessel had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently paying also Maria.</span> <span id="s787">I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money.</span> <span id="s788">I didn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either.</span> <span id="s789">So, I thought things were taken care of by Fessel.</span> <span id="s790">The other couple they also were from Louve, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names because they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort of in a group relationship, you were strangers.</span> <span id="s791">Maybe you had one thing in common, we are all Jews and we want to survive.</span> <span id="s792">There was one thing in common but different interests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing.</span> <span id="s793">So, the dynamics of our group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations.</span> <span id="s794">I could take part of some of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group.</span> <span id="s795">There was a point in time the ghetto was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the concentration camp ____________ is being liquidated.</span> <span id="s796">The rumors were also that the Russian army is moving toward Poland, closer and closer.</span> <span id="s797">They weren't talking about immediate occupation or immediate conquer of the territory but it was close enough that you need to make a decision.</span> <span id="s798">Whether to stay in the hiding place or to move on.</span> <span id="s799">I did not take any part of the decision because my action was always to stay in the hiding place.</span> <span id="s800">So that wasn't an option that would be denied to me.</span> <span id="s801">The other option was whether or not to escape Louve all together.</span> <span id="s802">There was a young couple who would be coming and in keeping in touch with us.</span> <span id="s803">They had Gentile papers and they had excellent Gentile features and they would be the ones with whom we had contact with the outside.</span> <span id="s804">They would know how to prepare the papers, Gentile papers and how we could be rescued.</span> <span id="s805">Now the question was should they take me into the rescue effort moving out of Louve.</span> <span id="s806">They weren't even talking about Hungary at that time at all.</span> <span id="s807">The question was they're going to be moving out, should they take me with them.</span> <span id="s808">I confronted that part with Fessel and I told Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I would like to be with them.</span> <span id="s809">I could always stay here, but I want to get out of Louve in general.</span> <span id="s810">This is a horrible place.</span> <span id="s811">I don't want to be here, even in hiding.</span> <span id="s812">He said well, we'll have to see what our resources are.</span> <span id="s813">We'll have to see if we can give you some papers.</span> <span id="s814">He apparently was good enough to do that for me.</span> <span id="s815">I was told that their plan is to escape ultimately to Hungary from Louve to _________ from ____________ to _____________ Mountains, through Slovakia to Hungary.</span> <span id="s816">That's the plan.</span> <span id="s817">I walked with them all the way.</span> <span id="s818">I'll go with you anyplace you go.</span> <span id="s819">I felt that I could be of help to them if they needed me.</span> <span id="s820">The time came sometime in the early part of December I think, maybe it was in December, that we got our papers, the Gentile papers with our photographs and the stamps and the my name was ____________________.</span> <span id="s821">I took the name of an acquaintance of mine from _____________.</span> <span id="s822">He was a very nice fellow and I thought he ought to have my name.</span> <span id="s823">So, from there on, my name was _______________ from then on until my liberation.</span> <span id="s824">My religion was catholic, and everything else was true on those papers.</span> <span id="s825">My birth and where I was born, and everything else except my name and my religion.</span> <span id="s826">From there on, there was at night prior to that by the way that was something very interesting happened that I recall.</span> <span id="s827">You know when you are in hiding for so many months you don't know how to purchase things.</span> <span id="s828">How to deal with the outside although we are informed by Marie where things are, how to get to the station, because now we have to move from Louve, buy a ticket, and these are small items but very crucial items.</span> <span id="s829">Get out of the house, buy a ticket, go into the main station, buy a ticket and go to ______________.</span> <span id="s830">Finding the place, and find a place and maybe a reservation for the train or not.</span> <span id="s831">That we did not know.</span> <span id="s832">Maria was not about to buy any tickets for us, so they asked me whether I could go on an exercise to the main station, look around, see where the purchase ticket box is, see if there is anything unusual and go buy the tickets.</span> <span id="s833">Well, I went there.</span> <span id="s834">One night they left me and I had to go from the place at night walking through the fields, through the barracks of the militia and there is a small station.</span> <span id="s835">I got to the station and I got to the main station and to see where I could buy tickets.</span> <span id="s836">I went to the main station, bought a ticket.</span> <span id="s837">On the way back to our place and to see the temperament and the environment we would be going through.</span> <span id="s838">When I came back, all the inhabitants of our hiding place were outside just in case to run in case they caught me and brought militia with me.</span> <span id="s839">They were relieved.</span> <span id="s840">I came back.</span> <span id="s841">Gave them the report and they were ready to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s846">I never asked her.</span> <span id="s847">The only thing that I could stipulate was that she was prearranged prior to that.</span> <span id="s848">The fact that I saw her one day in a factory walking towards the office that means she was prearranged.</span> <span id="s849">She was given I'm almost sure that she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel.</span> <span id="s850">I know other things that during my stay in the hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that was the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with Fessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always be the winner on that evening.</span> <span id="s851">He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game was over, he would be coming out with money.</span> <span id="s852">He knew about us obviously, so he was paid that way through winning in this game.</span> <span id="s853">Other than that, I don't have any other facts, but Maria a person of no wealth.</span> <span id="s854">She had this house and she was with Usak who told me where she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what was the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of human compassion.</span> <span id="s855">Maybe it was a combination of both.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Was this a very lonely time for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active.</span> <span id="s858">I was very active.</span> <span id="s859">My mind was always going regardless what was goingwhat surrounded me.</span> <span id="s860">My question was to myself how do you get out of this place.</span> <span id="s861">I was fierce about it.</span> <span id="s862">I was driven by that.</span> <span id="s863">How do you get out and stay alive.</span> <span id="s864">Because I felt that I had to say something later on.</span> <span id="s865">Maybe this is why I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had to say it, to say that part.</span> <span id="s866">So lonely, no I wasn't lonely.</span> <span id="s867">I was too dynamic to be lonely.</span> <span id="s868">So, when they saw me coming back from that train station and they greeted me with enthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our things whatever I had.</span> <span id="s869">I don't think I had anything with me.</span> <span id="s870">I just had just my hat, my jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go.</span> <span id="s871">We went through the main station, got our ticket.</span> <span id="s872">There was a direct train to ___________.</span> <span id="s873">It was all night.</span> <span id="s874">We went through over night and the following day we were already in ______________.</span> <span id="s875">We were picked up by the smugglers.</span> <span id="s876">Now, let me back off just a bit.</span> <span id="s877">That couple who used to come who had their connection from outside, brought the papers for all of us.</span> <span id="s878">That couple that I forget their name, were left behind because that's what they chose, to stay.</span> <span id="s879">All of us left, including the lady friend of Fessel's brother.</span> <span id="s880">By the way, she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s881">She was big and my estimation was that she was in the eighth month of pregnancy, but she was walking and she was also determined to survive.</span> <span id="s882">We were on a train and got picked up later on in _____________ by the smugglers who were previously arranged by this couple who gave us all the false papers.</span> <span id="s883">We went to a place.</span> <span id="s884">I forgot this area at the time where it was that they took us.</span> <span id="s885">I remember that we had our lunch with Polish kielbasa.</span> <span id="s886">We had a piece of bread and that evening or that night, we were going to move out of _____________.</span> <span id="s887">Because everything else was prearranged.</span> <span id="s888">It was sometime December or it was early part of January.</span> <span id="s889">I don't know that period of time.</span> <span id="s890">It was 1944, January or 1944 or December 1943 but very close to that time.</span> <span id="s891">I want to say that I am close right on the verge between December and January.</span> <span id="s892">It was very cold and we took a train from _______________ to a small village close to Tatra Mountains.</span> <span id="s893">It was basically a ski resort and we departed from there.</span> <span id="s894">We picked up and we kept on walking.</span> <span id="s895">It was an area probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police.</span> <span id="s896">By the way, this area was strictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and border police.</span> <span id="s897">The smugglers were actually Polish.</span> <span id="s898">I forget their name.</span> <span id="s899">I forget even their faces but we got through and we kept on walking through the Tatra mountains.</span> <span id="s900">The episode that I recall was walking in the snow.</span> <span id="s901">It was so called and also the snow was very deep.</span> <span id="s902">The surface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into a trap because you couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s903">It was a very difficult walk.</span> <span id="s904">Now, the lady who was pregnant she had a horrible time walking.</span> <span id="s905">At least I had boots but I don't recall if she had boots.</span> <span id="s906">So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her.</span> <span id="s907">No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph.</span> <span id="s908">The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart problem.</span> <span id="s909">He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that mode.</span> <span id="s910">I was young.</span> <span id="s911">I felt good.</span> <span id="s912">I was strong and I tried to help her.</span> <span id="s913">I did help her.</span> <span id="s914">I kept on walking with her.</span> <span id="s915">At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and embracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us.</span> <span id="s916">At one point in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to help her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they wouldn't survive the trip.</span> <span id="s917">I couldn't leave her.</span> <span id="s918">I had to walk with her and I walked her and a long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out.</span> <span id="s919">Such a shame, but we survived.</span> <span id="s920">We went through the Tatra mountains and got into Slovakia.</span> <span id="s921">At least we were there.</span> <span id="s922">We were so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us.</span> <span id="s923">They took us into a place which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified ourselves as refugees from Poland, so we were all Polish.</span> <span id="s924">So, from this police area I think they took us into a school.</span> <span id="s925">We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for.</span> <span id="s926">I don't recall how long we stayed there.</span> <span id="s927">There was another couple from Poland, independently they came in.</span> <span id="s928">They were refugees.</span> <span id="s929">One was a professor I think, a Polish professor with his wife, and some other people.</span> <span id="s930">At that point they took a picture of us that I had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time later.</span> <span id="s931">The object has to move from Slovakia now to Hungary and within a few days I think we were moved from Slovakia to another border town which I have a hard time remembering.</span> <span id="s932">It was _____________ comes to my mind.</span> <span id="s933">Maybe I'm wrong but ________________ was the border.</span> <span id="s934">There were some Jewssee Hungary at that point in time was not occupied.</span> <span id="s935">It was the early part in January.</span> <span id="s936">If I recall well, when I was already in Hungary, Hungary was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later part of January but not the early part.</span> <span id="s937">We were brought in and ________________ and there was a Jewish couple that took us in for that evening.</span> <span id="s938">It was a Friday I think and the reason I remember was because there was shobotz and they offered us __________.</span> <span id="s939">A ________ is a meal a Jewish meal with beans and chicken and carrots and all that good stuff.</span> <span id="s940">It was very good, very tasty.</span> <span id="s941">This was the first time I was exposed to it.</span> <span id="s942">I was very grateful for it.</span> <span id="s943">The following few days from __________ because we wanted to g into Budapest and that was our goal because from there on Fessel had his plans.</span> <span id="s944">I had my plans so once I got into Budapest which we got into Budapest within a week or so.</span> <span id="s945">I don't remember that period very well, but I remember that we were in Budapest and the question was we were not occupied at that time so we were free and I identified myself with the Polish organization with all there were different refugee camps, not camps but offices and you reported yourself that you are one of them.</span> <span id="s946">Whether they helped us or not I don't recall.</span> <span id="s947">It was immaterial to me.</span> <span id="s948">What I wanted to do to identify myself that I am a Polish refugee and to be on their books.</span> <span id="s949">From there on it was just a matter of finding out your level of survival.</span> <span id="s950">Where do you go from there.</span> <span id="s951">The trigger point was the time when the Germans again invaded Hungary.</span> <span id="s952">That was the trigger point, be on the run.</span> <span id="s953">You had to run again, and where to you run.</span> <span id="s954">By that time I had already met some people, not friends, but acquaintances, we became friends because they were in the same shoes.</span> <span id="s955">The same problem, where do you run.</span> <span id="s956">One thought was to run to get into Turkey.</span> <span id="s957">The way you could get to Turkey was through Rumania.</span> <span id="s958">The other thought was to run to Switzerland, means you had to go through Austria.</span> <span id="s959">Which route do you explore.</span> <span id="s960">You explore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other.</span> <span id="s961">I felt to be in Switzerland would be a good deal to do, but to go you had to Austria.</span> <span id="s962">That was bad.</span> <span id="s963">A better way is to go through Turkey through Rumania.</span> <span id="s964">I had friends that became my friends that were in the underground movement and I joined them.</span> <span id="s965">Some of these people were mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s966">Some Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going to run somewhere.</span> <span id="s967">I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the Polish underground which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be comfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group.</span> <span id="s968">Even that group, I have some Polish members.</span> <span id="s969">I was in a cell.</span> <span id="s970">Seven people, we had seven people in our cell.</span> <span id="s971">I wasn't given orders to carry out.</span> <span id="s972">Basically I was a courier for them, transferring papers from place to place, mainly from Buddha to Paris and from Paris to Buddha and so on.</span> <span id="s973">At one time I had to go outside Budapest, but this was a short trip and I came back.</span> <span id="s974">One time I had to carry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about it.</span> <span id="s975">I'm doing something about it.</span> <span id="s976">Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers, false birth certificate, false statements of good standing of a given community and so on.</span> <span id="s977">Church papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s978">Not specifically for Polish refugees.</span> <span id="s979">We were all saved so called.</span> <span id="s980">The question now is how do you help out the Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s981">They needed the papers.</span> <span id="s982">They did not have the flexibilities that we did have because we were right outside.</span> <span id="s983">There was a time that they were mostly almost confined to the house ghettos.</span> <span id="s984">They already had the stars.</span> <span id="s985">They had to carry, we did not.</span> <span id="s986">We were free.</span> <span id="s987">I happened to get myself with the underground and they advised me to have two or three residents in Budapest, having a place to live in Buddha, in Pessin Buddha I had to places where to live and when I chose a place to live, I used to live always with a Christian family.</span> <span id="s988">I was safe there.</span> <span id="s989">Although I tell you I feel at time whenever there was a knock at the door, there was always a heart beat, an extra heart beat that I have developed later on in my life because somebody is knocking at the door at the wrong time and maybe for the right purpose or for the wrong reason as far as I am concerned.</span> <span id="s990">So, there were time when they were raiding some areas, but this was in Gentile areas.</span> <span id="s991">I never lived with Jewish families, not in Budapest.</span> <span id="s992">But there were raids just in general and I was one of them, but I never had an occasion to be examined and to be found that I had any problems with them being either question whether I was a Gentile or not.</span> <span id="s993">As a matter of fact, I used to go with those families to the church every Sunday morning, and to be one of them.</span> <span id="s994">It was that kind of life that we tried to provide papers to the Jewish people in Budapest.</span> <span id="s995">Papers, birth certificates, status certificates and so on.</span> <span id="s996">Being in Budapest right in the midst, I'm almost angry with myself not knowing of ______________.</span> <span id="s997">I never heard of him, even in the close circuits that I was that we knew how to survive things.</span> <span id="s998">No mention about Swedish consulates and so on.</span> <span id="s999">I don't know if I would have gone that route, but at least I was never exposed to that.</span> <span id="s1000">Friends of mine were exposed to Switzerland and they went that route.</span> <span id="s1001">I understand he never made it.</span> <span id="s1002">Another friend went through to Turkey.</span> <span id="s1003">It was a perfect Gentile couple who had went through a reverse of circumcision.</span> <span id="s1004">They were perfect in the physiotomy.</span> <span id="s1005">They got through ___________ and through Rumania but they were torpedoed in the Black Sea I understand, so they never made it either.</span> <span id="s1006">I was still there in Budapest and the question was when I'm going to get out of it and one day I have an order to go to Rumania because I have asked for them to send me to Rumania and to get in touch with other underground in Rumania.</span> <span id="s1007">They send me and they told me who to see, when I get over the boarder, what to send them.</span> <span id="s1008">The question was whether or not the border between Rumania and Hungary is safe.</span> <span id="s1009">Of course, I was told that the reason they are sending me is to get that message to the other side, to Rumania.</span> <span id="s1010">Later on I found out that the reason they sent me was to find out whether the border was safe.</span> <span id="s1011">So, it was one of those things that you have to take your chances.</span> <span id="s1012">I did not know about that.</span> <span id="s1013">I found that on later on when I was sick and back in Germany, that I wasn't told the whole truth of the matter.</span> <span id="s1014">Shortly I went out from Budapest directly to ______________.</span> <span id="s1015">I think that was the name, that was the city, and ____________ I had to pick up those two smugglers who were going to take me to Rumania.</span> <span id="s1016">The way they identified themselves is by folding hands two of them and they were there, they were waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1017">And they took me and we were not far from __________.</span> <span id="s1018">___________ was the village I think right on the border between Hungary and Rumania.</span> <span id="s1019">They took me to a place to a barn that's all I remember, a barn.</span> <span id="s1020">Apparently I didn't sleep all that long and I was so exhausted I just fell asleep before someone burst into that barn and it was the Hungarian _________.</span> <span id="s1021">___________ with the black hats with a pheasant feather.</span> <span id="s1022">From there on they interrogated me.</span> <span id="s1023">I did not have too much with me.</span> <span id="s1024">I didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s1025">I had a couple hundred penco, which is minimal.</span> <span id="s1026">I didn't have any papers other than my own identification paper and that's all I had.</span> <span id="s1027">I had a few photographs that got me into trouble later on, but they were mostly interested about my spy mission.</span> <span id="s1028">What was I carrying, why kind of message was I carrying to Rumania.</span> <span id="s1029">This route by the way was known as a route the Jews were fleeing away from Rumania.</span> <span id="s1030">There was one lady that I recognized her as being Jewish and she was in that interrogation room.</span> <span id="s1031">They whisked me away from her later on.</span> <span id="s1032">She was crying.</span> <span id="s1033">Later on I also saw those two smugglers in another circumstances.</span> <span id="s1034">They were beaten very severely.</span> <span id="s1035">Their faces were black and blue, so at least from my prospective they did not betray me, someone betrayed them and in turn I was also betrayed.</span> <span id="s1036">I was interrogated for a number of hours.</span> <span id="s1037">I don't know at what point they transferred me, they deliver me to the gestapo.</span> <span id="s1038">By the way, from that place they took me back to _____________ where it was the headquarters of gestapo.</span> <span id="s1039">I was escorted by the Hungarian gerdeams.</span> <span id="s1040">The gerdarms they were actually the border police but they had some other special assignment.</span> <span id="s1041">They were the leaders of the police force in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1042">I stayed in _____________ maybe a few days and I was again interrogated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Were you beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Yes, I was beaten.</span> <span id="s1045">I was beaten terribly.</span> <span id="s1046">In other words they put a bar between your legs and then your whole body is folded downwards and you're beaten on your feet.</span> <span id="s1047">Of course on the buttocks and so on.</span> <span id="s1048">It was very painful, but I took it.</span> <span id="s1049">It wasn't a big thing that I recall it was impossible not to survive.</span> <span id="s1050">They wanted to know again, what was the message that I was trying to deliver to Rumania.</span> <span id="s1051">Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being Jewish wasn't their concern apparently.</span> <span id="s1052">I don't recall that.</span> <span id="s1053">Whether they took it for granted one way or the other, I was never told.</span> <span id="s1054">The main idea for them was to move me as soon as possible back to Budapest and they took me back to Budapest and they put me in a political prison on _________________.</span> <span id="s1055">That was the political prison in Budapest and I stayed there for a number of weeks or months almost.</span> <span id="s1056">I'm not quite sure how long.</span> <span id="s1057">It was there that I met other some of my acquaintances from Budapest.</span> <span id="s1058">I met ___________ who was the ambassador from Hungary to Poland who spoke perfect Polish language.</span> <span id="s1059">I also met across the court a lady name ______________who later on I found out she was Hanna _________.</span> <span id="s1060">She was very resourceful to convey her name one letter after another.</span> <span id="s1061">There was a time probably that I recall because we were seeing ____________ at one point in time.</span> <span id="s1062">It was a period when it was Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1063">It was a time that if I want to tag a point it was Yom Kippur 1944.</span> <span id="s1064">____________ was still alive.</span> <span id="s1065">__________ definitely was still alive because I corresponded with him later on after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1066">I was interrogated almost daily because not only they wanted to know what was my message but the unfortunate thing was they found a picture in my possession.</span> <span id="s1067">A fellow that I befriended in Budapest who was from Berlin, he was also a Jewish refugee but for some other reasons I befriended him and we were dating girls together and we had fun with him and he was in that prison also.</span> <span id="s1068">They caught him, so they wanted to know what was my association with him.</span> <span id="s1069">So it was a complication.</span> <span id="s1070">I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1071">I don't remember even his name but he was a very nice fellow.</span> <span id="s1072">He was a fellow that I would feel very comfortable to be a friend.</span> <span id="s1073">Sometime later after 1944 I remember we were about to be ready to be moved out of this prison and we were told that they are going to send us to some kind of camp.</span> <span id="s1074">It must have been some time in October because I recall I got in, they brought us to Auschwitz and it was on my birthday, October 29, 1944 that we walked on that platform.</span> <span id="s1075">It was a train, from a regular train and they brought us immediately to this office.</span> <span id="s1076">They tattooed us.</span> <span id="s1077">Now, my name was 193 229, no longer the name ____________.</span> <span id="s1078">There was no other names but my number.</span> <span id="s1079">The time in Auschwitz I have very little memory of it.</span> <span id="s1080">I did work there.</span> <span id="s1081">I did get this uniform.</span> <span id="s1082">I had the cap, with the stripe.</span> <span id="s1083">Whether they gave me some wooden shoes I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1084">Probably they did, maybe I did have it.</span> <span id="s1085">I did have it I think, I did have it, the wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1086">I was one of the inmates now.</span> <span id="s1087">I was in one of the barracks, surprised that I don't even remember the number of the barrack because you must remember that.</span> <span id="s1088">I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s1089">Maybe I don't want to remember, but we were close to that barrack where there was a special barrack where things werea punitive barrack and I was told to stay away from it, that barrack.</span> <span id="s1090">Not much, I don't think that I was ever concerned about being gassed.</span> <span id="s1091">My only question was how do I get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: You were not there as a Jewish prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1094">I'm not sure if I was a Jewish prisoner or not.</span> <span id="s1095">It seems to me I was among Jews so I was a Jewish prisoner.</span> <span id="s1096">Until a given day that a barrack was empty and they were selecting people left and right, left and right, and they selected me.</span> <span id="s1097">I think it was a left position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back.</span> <span id="s1098">Took me back into my barrack.</span> <span id="s1099">It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they look at my tattoo oh you're a ____________, that's the word that I all of a sudden get to my mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever.</span> <span id="s1100">But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or not a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what my status was because I was one of them.</span> <span id="s1101">One major event that I recall wa the hanging of five Polish prisoners who escaped Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1102">When they were brought back, they took out the whole camp to watch the hanging.</span> <span id="s1103">That was sometime probably in December.</span> <span id="s1104">It was awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the morning when the hanging took place and after the hanging normal life proceeded in the camp.</span> <span id="s1105">Then again there's a gap that I don't recall what was going on, just a matter of daily consumption of the stale bread.</span> <span id="s1106">The bread came from the transports from the wagons from the trains, but we were given stale bread.</span> <span id="s1107">It was just at least it was something to eat.</span> <span id="s1108">The food was very terrible, very thin soup, just water.</span> <span id="s1109">But I was notdidn't feel that bad.</span> <span id="s1110">I still felt that I could withstand the ordeals and whatever took place because they were talking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were moving in closer and closer.</span> <span id="s1111">As a matter of fact, our thought was that _____________ was already taken.</span> <span id="s1112">Maybe it was a hope, maybe it was not, but anyway they were very close.</span> <span id="s1113">So, the recreation of Auschwitz was almost eminent.</span> <span id="s1114">January 5, comes to my mind but I'll stand corrected if it was something else.</span> <span id="s1115">We were evacuated from Auschwitz and we walked a long time to another station, and I don't recall too well but we were put into open carts, only men.</span> <span id="s1116">I hadn't seen any women, and they took us out.</span> <span id="s1117">A horrible trip, a horrible trip, people were dying because of this cold exposure.</span> <span id="s1118">I had frostbite on both feet.</span> <span id="s1119">They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me personally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive.</span> <span id="s1120">I always felt that I could survive.</span> <span id="s1121">There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I couldn't physically move things the way I used to.</span> <span id="s1122">We were, the train was moving through Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1123">I know because I heard that and as we were going underneath the overpasses, they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to us in the open cart.</span> <span id="s1124">It was a good omen.</span> <span id="s1125">I had a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mine with whom I've been for since Budapest, that's where I met him, he was with me all along in the camp.</span> <span id="s1126">He survived by the way and he was in Israel.</span> <span id="s1127">He saw me sometime later in Munich.</span> <span id="s1128">He visited me in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1129">We went out and they kept us moving along from place to place.</span> <span id="s1130">There was no place that they had in mind.</span> <span id="s1131">We finally wound up in ____________, why ____________ I don't know.</span> <span id="s1132">Just before we reached _________________ they were discarding all the bodies from the train and people were most of them were that majority was alive and there were shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s1133">It was a huge mountain of the corpses from the cart.</span> <span id="s1134">It was molestation.</span> <span id="s1135">It was all guarded by the SS and their henchmen.</span> <span id="s1136">We stayed there perhaps a few hours, they kept us back and we kept on going, and from there on they took us from _____________ to ___________.</span> <span id="s1137">We were told that when we came to Flossenberg that we were a sore lot, and we were, but we survived.</span> <span id="s1138">____________, the headings on the sores of my feet, the healed and I don't recall what I did in Flossenberg other than that I was healthier and a long point in time the news came to Flossenberg that Roosevelt died and somehow President Roosevelt was a point of hope to me as long as he is alive, as long as he's in charge, he was the one who actually initiated the coalition and invasion of Europe.</span> <span id="s1139">When he died a spark left out of me because I felt there is not going to be a continuation in the war, but later on a friend of mine, said another president will take over and he'll continue that.</span> <span id="s1140">Flossenberg was the time where it was a step before my liberation.</span> <span id="s1141">I think they took us out on our way to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1142">That's where we were told an Leon disappeared.</span> <span id="s1143">I don't know where he went, my friend Leon.</span> <span id="s1144">There was another fellow, a Russian fellow who was also an inmate and with whom I befriended.</span> <span id="s1145">He was my friend now that I tried to help him out from the actions in Flossenberg.</span> <span id="s1146">It was three days and three nights of that death march towards Dachau.</span> <span id="s1147">April the 23rd we were liberated by the First Army, I think.</span> <span id="s1148">At that point in time, I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1149">I was a free man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307 PAGE 20</span></p></body></html>
