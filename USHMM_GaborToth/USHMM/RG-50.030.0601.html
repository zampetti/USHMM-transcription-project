15th of October 2010 at the Kindertransport Association Conference in Arlington, VirginiA: Okay.</span> <span id="s17">Let's start from the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Answer: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Your name, if it was different at birth, when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: It was still Hanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Your name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s23">But I've not used it because that's what my father would call me when he was very strict with me.</span> <span id="s24">I don't have a good association with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And what's your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Maiden name is Gross, G-R-O-S-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What year were you born?</span> <span id="s28">When is your birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: In 1925, June 16th.</span> <span id="s30">It was a very good time of the year.</span> <span id="s31">I like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: In Vienna, right in the middle of town we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So what was your childhood like?</span> <span id="s35">Tell me your earliest memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well, there was my father and my mother and my older brother who was five years older.</span> <span id="s37">And then a stepbrother, Paul, who was much order, 17 years older, who really didn't live with us, but he was part of the family.</span> <span id="s38">And my father was much older than my mother.</span> <span id="s39">My father was 18 years older than my mother, and so he always seemed more like my grandfather to me.</span> <span id="s40">And my mother was 35 when I was born, so compared to how I felt at 35 or see other people being 35 now, she seemed much older, too.</span> <span id="s41">And we lived in an apartment right in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s42">And so my father was a lawyer, an attorney, and he had his office -- I think we were on the fourth floor or sixth floor -- I'm not sure – of this building.</span> <span id="s43">And he had an office on the mezzanine of that same floor, so he would always come home for lunch at 1:00 o'clock, around the time that I came home from school.</span> <span id="s44">And that was our main meal at that time.</span> <span id="s45">And in those days, children did not go out of the apartment by themselves.</span> <span id="s46">There was always somebody with me, a Fräulein type.</span> <span id="s47">And I was taken everywhere, to the park and ice skating.</span> <span id="s48">My father took me ice skating.</span> <span id="s49">And there was no such thing as really playing in the neighborhood on the street.</span> <span id="s50">But we did take summer vacations, lengthy summer vacations to either a different part of Austria or to the beach in northern Italy.</span> <span id="s51">And so then I think we were able to play freely.</span> <span id="s52">But during the year, we were pretty constricted.</span> <span id="s53">My brother and I were not too close.</span> <span id="s54">The ideas in those days made a lot of difference.</span> <span id="s55">And he was an ardent boy scout and he thought all of my interests were silly and superficial.</span> <span id="s56">But whenever I was sick -- and I seemed to have been sick a good deal in those days with colds and flu and so forth -- he would play games and especially chess with me.</span> <span id="s57">And I just recently picked it up again.</span> <span id="s58">So that's been fun.</span> <span id="s59">And so I went to elementary school.</span> <span id="s60">And I don't remember much about it except for a gym teacher who was very -- who looked more like a snowman or a snowwoman.</span> <span id="s61">She was built that way.</span> <span id="s62">And I never liked gym.</span> <span id="s63">So I think that was four grades or five grades.</span> <span id="s64">And then I went to another school, a private school.</span> <span id="s65">I believe it was a private school called Luithlen, L-U-I-T-H-L-E-N.</span> <span id="s66">And somehow, even though Jewish children were not allowed to go to school after awhile when Hitler came, I think I remained in school there somehow until I could leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: So the schools that you attended, were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s69">Definitely.</span> <span id="s70">Yes.</span> <span id="s71">Yeah.</span> <span id="s72">And then in this middle school we had religion classes, and they were done with release time.</span> <span id="s73">In other words, the Protestant children would go one place for instruction and the Catholic children to another and the Jewish children to another.</span> <span id="s74">And that's when I began to go to synagogue a little bit.</span> <span id="s75">My parents really didn't go.</span> <span id="s76">They would go to their parents or my father's parents in Czechoslovakia occasionally over the -- the Yom Kippur, over the holidays.</span> <span id="s77">But otherwise, no, there wasn't much celebration of holidays.</span> <span id="s78">And in fact, we had a Christmas tree for many years until I made my mother buy a menorah when I was old enough to go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s79">And then when I was a tween or an early teenager, we would go to children's services, the young people's services at the main synagogue in ViennA: But I must have went -- I think I went mostly for the boys who also attended and then we could all go skating afterwards.</span> <span id="s80">So I didn't take all that very seriously at that time.</span> <span id="s81">My earliest memory of there being something wrong politically or worrying about what's going to happen to Jewish people was I think in 1934 when I remember going on vacation by car with my parents to a place called Bad Gastein, a resort-type thing.</span> <span id="s82">And we got there the evening, at night when it was dark.</span> <span id="s83">And the village was in the valley, and we came down from the mountain or hill or something.</span> <span id="s84">And all the windows in the town, in the village, were lit up and there were candles in the window.</span> <span id="s85">And apparently a chancellor from Austria, and his name was Dollfuss, had died.</span> <span id="s86">I don't know whether he died or was killed.</span> <span id="s87">But he was known to be very sympathetic to Hitler.</span> <span id="s88">And so it was eerie that he was so mourned or so celebrated.</span> <span id="s89">And I guess those lights are something I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s90">And also because my father was older he would always worry about whether he'd die before my mother and so forth.</span> <span id="s91">And he worried a great deal.</span> <span id="s92">My mother was a worrywart, too.</span> <span id="s93">And I've become a worrywart as well.</span> <span id="s94">And I married one.</span> <span id="s95">I married one, too.</span> <span id="s96">But my father was always worried about the times or money or clients or whatever.</span> <span id="s97">And he was very serious.</span> <span id="s98">He was quite an intellectual person.</span> <span id="s99">He was always reading.</span> <span id="s100">So there was really very little game playing in our house except occasionally my brother and I. And the only sport was ice skating.</span> <span id="s101">And then I went to gymnastic classes as a little girl next door.</span> <span id="s102">And swimming, I think.</span> <span id="s103">So somehow when Hitler came to Austria and was practically invited into Austria, somehow it wasn't a surprise because we had always lived with that kind of fear.</span> <span id="s104">So I don't know what else I can tell you.</span> <span id="s105">I had a few good friends, but the friends I had went to the same school, but they lived other places.</span> <span id="s106">So it wasn't like you could get together after school.</span> <span id="s107">You had to make a play date or something.</span> <span id="s108">A little older than a play date.</span> <span id="s109">And one friend, Francie, did come to New York and I did see her once or twice in New York.</span> <span id="s110">Oh, and another friend, Eva Schiffer.</span> <span id="s111">She was a real intellectual.</span> <span id="s112">My father adored her.</span> <span id="s113">And she lived around the corner.</span> <span id="s114">And my grades were always compared to hers.</span> <span id="s115">And I think she's a retired professor at Amherst or Andover now, and we are out of touch, although we were back in touch in New York.</span> <span id="s116">And then one friend went to South America, to Argentina, and we completely lost touch.</span> <span id="s117">And a boy I liked whet to Uruguay.</span> <span id="s118">So everybody was spread out.</span> <span id="s119">There was no cohesiveness.</span> <span id="s120">And I think even now I envy some of my friends who grew up in one town and had their high school crowd and go to reunions and all these memories.</span> <span id="s121">So I don't have that.</span> <span id="s122">So I don't know what else should I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: So do you remember feeling -- you didn't – did you recognize or celebrate any Jewish holidays in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well, we then eventually bought a menorah.</span> <span id="s125">I don't remember celebrating Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s126">No, really, I don't think we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Were a lot of your friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yeah, they were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So growing up did you experience any anti-Semitism in your --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Not immediately.</span> <span id="s131">Not among my friends, I didn't, because I guess I just didn't -- wasn't open to that because there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s132">And we had non-Jewish help, Fräuleins and so forth, a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s133">But I didn't experience anything from them.</span> <span id="s134">And of course, they had to leave as soon as Hitler came.</span> <span id="s135">Other people in my life, my gym teacher, my aunt was my piano teacher.</span> <span id="s136">And they were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s137">But we talked about it.</span> <span id="s138">And my father would talk about the things that Hitler did.</span> <span id="s139">And we would -- this is before concentration camps, but we were aware of the Nuremburg laws and of what happens, and you know, and how you have to -- how you can't work any more and you can't have any non-Jewish help.</span> <span id="s140">My father had to get rid of his secretary.</span> <span id="s141">He had one secretary who was with him for 30 years or something.</span> <span id="s142">But personally, I can't say I experienced it.</span> <span id="s143">My main experience was years later when I visited Vienna the first time, I think, in '69.</span> <span id="s144">Do you want to hear that story?</span> <span id="s145">Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Uh-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: With my husband.</span> <span id="s148">And since he didn't speak German, we couldn't go to the theater, but we went to a lot of operas.</span> <span id="s149">And so one night we went to the operA: And we also stayed at a hotel right across from the operA: We didn't have time to eat beforehand, so we went to a restaurant nearby there afterwards.</span> <span id="s150">And I think generally in there when a place is crowded, they don't have you necessarily wait.</span> <span id="s151">They seat you with somebody.</span> <span id="s152">And so we were seated with this man who was a bit older than I am, maybe 10, 15 years older than I was at the time.</span> <span id="s153">Started talking somehow.</span> <span id="s154">And I spoke a little broken German.</span> <span id="s155">And he said, "Oh, how come your German is so good?"</span> <span id="s156">or something.</span> <span id="s157">And I said, "Well, I'm glad you think it's good."</span> <span id="s158">I said, "I used to live here."</span> <span id="s159">And he said, "Oh?"</span> <span id="s160">And I said, "Well, I left in 1939.</span> <span id="s161">I had to leave when Hitler came to AustriA:" And so he said, "Oh," and then he fell silent.</span> <span id="s162">Oh, and he had been some kind of movie producer or something.</span> <span id="s163">Anyway, he became silent and five minutes later he got up.</span> <span id="s164">And it felt very chilly.</span> <span id="s165">The Austrians were never overly friendly, and they were more Nazis than the Germans were, I think.</span> <span id="s166">So again, it was not surprising, but at the same time it was extremely uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s167">And just such a tiny little incident that I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s168">So I think if I had experienced more incidents and more graphic incidents, I would have remembered.</span> <span id="s169">But I just did not happen to be with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: How did the Nuremburg laws or I guess the Nazi rise to power, how did it affect you and your family at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Well, my father I think not being able to have anybody working for you who is even partially Jewish.</span> <span id="s172">So that was the big thing.</span> <span id="s173">And that meant that – you know, we had household help, a maid.</span> <span id="s174">And everybody was very loyal and friendly and they suddenly had to disappear.</span> <span id="s175">For my father, no help in the office, and the office was shrinking.</span> <span id="s176">He was upset about that.</span> <span id="s177">And so there wasn't anybody in my family, whether -- we were just Jewish, so that wasn't in question, whether we had a grandfather or whatever.</span> <span id="s178">So I think that was the main thing.</span> <span id="s179">What else was in there?</span> <span id="s180">I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: You said that your father talked about the things that Hitler was doing.</span> <span id="s182">Were you aware of the Naziism and what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s184">As I look back, we were very politically aware as children or teenagers.</span> <span id="s185">Much more so than I later found kids either in England or America being.</span> <span id="s186">Yeah, we were.</span> <span id="s187">And then, of course, when the annexation started.</span> <span id="s188">And my mother's half-sister lived, in Prague, her husband, and he was -- I mean, they were very well-situated.</span> <span id="s189">He was the president of a bank.</span> <span id="s190">And they refused to leave.</span> <span id="s191">I mean, this whole business over what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s192">In fact, I had an uncle and an aunt in ViennA: And he was a government employee.</span> <span id="s193">And I guess he was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s194">He thought it would never happen to him.</span> <span id="s195">And they didn't leave, and they perished in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s196">My aunt and uncle in Czechoslovakia left in time.</span> <span id="s197">Their children made them leave just in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Do you recall -- What are your memories of Hitler coming to power in Austria?</span> <span id="s199">Do you recall when the change happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s201">I remember that something – he immediately took over the radio station, the one means of communication.</span> <span id="s202">And I remember -- of course there were a lot of Nazi soldiers around town, and they were marching in the Ringstrasse.</span> <span id="s203">Yeah.</span> <span id="s204">And then real fear settled in because we then -- well, it was after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s205">And I guess I heard about Kristallnacht later.</span> <span id="s206">I didn't see any of those terrible things happening on the street.</span> <span id="s207">But then we began to be really afraid.</span> <span id="s208">The person in power was the superintendent of the apartment building.</span> <span id="s209">And it was a question of whether he was going to be our friend or foe.</span> <span id="s210">And everything depended on him.</span> <span id="s211">And so I think we were all in fear that he would say yes, such and such, the Grosses living there, Jewish, and go take them.</span> <span id="s212">But fortunately that never happened.</span> <span id="s213">My brother actually left the year before.</span> <span id="s214">He left soon after Hitler came to power, and he went tom Germany and then to Denmark and later on to South America, to BoliviA: So I was the only one left at home.</span> <span id="s215">And my stepbrother had married.</span> <span id="s216">And he was -- my father's first wife was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s217">So my stepbrother for certain didn't grow up Jewish, but he didn't grow up with anything else either, just nondenominational.</span> <span id="s218">And he married a Jewish woman, one whose sister and brother-in-law actually emigrated to Palestine, to Israel then.</span> <span id="s219">But they left.</span> <span id="s220">His biological mother was related to a very prominent Czech shoe manufacturer.</span> <span id="s221">And they were willing to help them get out, but only if he -- if they both converted and didn't ever acknowledge their Jewish family any more, which they did.</span> <span id="s222">But everybody had to survive in those days.</span> <span id="s223">That's what they had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Do you recall --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: You go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: -- when the decision was made that you would leave on the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well, I think it was somehow made early in the year.</span> <span id="s228">Early '39, it must have been.</span> <span id="s229">But the understanding -- all this was, it didn't seem like such a tragic thing because the understanding always was that my parents would come to England two months later.</span> <span id="s230">And then after I left the British quarter was closed so they couldn't come.</span> <span id="s231">And they very fortunately were able to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s232">And my father subsequently died here two years later, so I never did see him again.</span> <span id="s233">But the good-byes were not that terrible because it was like, "So long.</span> <span id="s234">I'm going to see you in a couple of months."</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What kind of preparation went into it?</span> <span id="s236">I mean, did you pack?</span> <span id="s237">Did your mother do it for you?</span> <span id="s238">What was the feeling in your home at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Well, ironically, it was kind of up.</span> <span id="s240">We bought clothes and packed clothes.</span> <span id="s241">You're going to need this and you're going to need that.</span> <span id="s242">And so it was a rather positive preparation.</span> <span id="s243">Kind of naive, really, when you think about it.</span> <span id="s244">So I did not understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: I was 13 by then.</span> <span id="s247">I understood, but I didn't expect a long separation.</span> <span id="s248">And then my relationship with my father, while it had always been good, you know, he was really overwhelmed by anxiety and worry.</span> <span id="s249">And I remember him being very short and angry with me a lot of the time.</span> <span id="s250">And so I do remember the feeling of, oh, good, I can get out of here kind of thing.</span> <span id="s251">And he did not come to the train station with me.</span> <span id="s252">My mother sent me off.</span> <span id="s253">In retrospect, it might just have been too hard for him to come.</span> <span id="s254">But it was a way also of getting distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: What are your memories of saying good-bye to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Well, again, it was a really warm and hugging good-bye, but it wasn't terribly sad because it was either denial or it was "I'm going to see you in a couple of months."</span> <span id="s257">So from what I've been reading -- and I just don't remember other kids and their parents in the train station.</span> <span id="s258">It was terrible for some kids.</span> <span id="s259">And then there's that story in that one movie about the father pulling the daughter out of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: "Into the Arms of Strangers."</span> <span id="s261">I just watched it yesterday.</span> <span id="s262">I recall that story when he pulled her out of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Did you read the book?</span> <span id="s264">It's a very readable, a nice book, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: What are your memories of the journey to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Well, foggy.</span> <span id="s267">Just sitting with a lot of kids on a train and wearing my name tag.</span> <span id="s268">Some people remember their number.</span> <span id="s269">I don't remember my number.</span> <span id="s270">And then some -- When we got to the -- what was it?</span> <span id="s271">The German -- the German border I don't remember so much.</span> <span id="s272">There wasn't a border, I guess.</span> <span id="s273">But then the German-Dutch border was – there were border guards who came on board, and it was scary.</span> <span id="s274">And we thought maybe we wouldn't get through or something.</span> <span id="s275">But we did.</span> <span id="s276">And somehow -- I remember most of this being at night, but I think maybe we did travel at night.</span> <span id="s277">People say when you get old your long-term memory is very good, but for me my short- or my long-term isn't very good.</span> <span id="s278">And so I remember that anxiety and those guards walking through and being very relieved afterwards.</span> <span id="s279">And so then we got to the Hague of Holland and got onto their boat, ship.</span> <span id="s280">And I was very seasick so I don't remember anything good about that.</span> <span id="s281">And then when I got there, some cousins of my mother's -- I don't remember whether they met me in -- what's the town that we landed in?</span> <span id="s282">Do you know?</span> <span id="s283">When we went to London.</span> <span id="s284">Anyway, when I got off the whole Kindertransport, they were there.</span> <span id="s285">And I stayed with them for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s286">And then I met my foster parents, who had been arranged for by my cousin, in a town called Cheltenham, which was west of London.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: I've heard of it before.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s289">Very nice town.</span> <span id="s290">Mostly for retired people, a couple of public schools.</span> <span id="s291">And they were very nice, very different.</span> <span id="s292">He was a high school -- vocational high school principal, and she was a housewife and a Christian Scientist and a viola player.</span> <span id="s293">And how I got to them was that her daughter had just married an American whom she met up at Cambridge and she had to have this very, very bright, perfect daughter.</span> <span id="s294">She was.</span> <span id="s295">She was very nice.</span> <span id="s296">And my cousin, the daughter of these – the Prague uncle and aunt met her inlaws on the ship coming back from the wedding, and they said, "You know, do you know anybody who would take my little cousin?"</span> <span id="s297">And she said she would ask her daughter-in-law's parents.</span> <span id="s298">And at first they didn't want to take me, but then they did.</span> <span id="s299">And so I got to them.</span> <span id="s300">And I don't know whether I got to them on a Friday or not.</span> <span id="s301">But I just remember going to school right away, like on a Monday, and being totally immersed in the language.</span> <span id="s302">Of course, when I get to them -- I mean, I had some English from the Fräulein.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: That was still '39.</span> <span id="s305">That was just before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Do you remember what month you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yeah, April.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: And you hadn't spoken -- English was a new language for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yeah, more or less.</span> <span id="s310">I mean, not totally new, but yeah.</span> <span id="s311">I didn't know much.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: What was school like?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: And also I got there at the end of that school year.</span> <span id="s314">School was -- eventually, I liked it.</span> <span id="s315">Of course, we had to wear school uniforms, which was totally strange.</span> <span id="s316">I learned to ride a bike so that I could -- the school was at the other end of town.</span> <span id="s317">It was a couple of miles on a bike.</span> <span id="s318">And gradually I made friends.</span> <span id="s319">I think I felt very strange and different at first.</span> <span id="s320">Plus, I don't think they ever had seen a Jewish person before.</span> <span id="s321">I'm not sure that my foster parents had, except that there was -- the MP from that area was Jewish.</span> <span id="s322">The name was Lipson.</span> <span id="s323">So it took a while, but then I had a couple of good friends in time, Megan and Audrey.</span> <span id="s324">And I did like most of the teachers.</span> <span id="s325">It was an all girls school.</span> <span id="s326">In the summer I think I went on a farm, the farm of a friend of theirs or something.</span> <span id="s327">I don't know what I did there, but I quite liked that for a couple of summers.</span> <span id="s328">I don't remember many -- I've not thought about that before.</span> <span id="s329">I don't remember many after school activities or anything.</span> <span id="s330">I don't know what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did you experience any air raids or bombings or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, really not because we were -- there was I think only one time I remember the sirens really going off.</span> <span id="s333">We were 100 miles west of London, and we were pretty much immune.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Did you have contact with your family, your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s336">My mother was a writer, and she could write letters to me.</span> <span id="s337">I didn't keep them except the letter when she wrote to me that my father had died after -- a year or two after they had emigrated from the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: She -- they emigrated together?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Together on the last ship, the Rotterdam from Marseilles, I think late August.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: In '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: '39, yes.</span> <span id="s342">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Where did they settle in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: They settled in Elmhurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Is that in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: No.</span> <span id="s347">Long Island.</span> <span id="s348">And her sister – one sister, the Prague sister, lived in Jackson Heights so that was across the way right there.</span> <span id="s349">And my mother lived -- they lived in an apartment for years.</span> <span id="s350">When I came to New York, I lived with her in that apartment.</span> <span id="s351">She had a huge bed, bed/sitting room.</span> <span id="s352">And there was another woman that she shared the apartment with when there was no money to speak of.</span> <span id="s353">My mother worked in a hat factory.</span> <span id="s354">She did sewing and this and that.</span> <span id="s355">And my father was too old to take the law exam.</span> <span id="s356">So I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s357">I think there was some help for refugees.</span> <span id="s358">I think they lived on that and my mother's earnings.</span> <span id="s359">Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: What was your knowledge of the war when you were in England?</span> <span id="s361">Did you know what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yeah, but not the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s363">But the bombings.</span> <span id="s364">And my brother and my stepbrother joined the U.S. Army from here.</span> <span id="s365">They had the long way around.</span> <span id="s366">They eventually came to the States and he joined the Army.</span> <span id="s367">And he was stationed in England, and I would see him on occasion.</span> <span id="s368">And the last time I saw him before he went over was June 6th, I think.</span> <span id="s369">When was Dunkirk?</span> <span id="s370">'41 or something.</span> <span id="s371">We met up in Manchester.</span> <span id="s372">Went to a tea dance.</span> <span id="s373">That's what people did then.</span> <span id="s374">And then he went overseas.</span> <span id="s375">So we knew about the bombings and the invasions and all of that.</span> <span id="s376">Well, we knew that terrible things happened to Jewish people, but I don't think we knew exactly what, which seems strange, doesn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: A lot of people experienced that, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: They weren't in Germany, they weren't in it, especially if you were younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s381">I don't know if I read any newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What about your brother who was in South America?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: He stayed there.</span> <span id="s384">He was with cousins.</span> <span id="s385">He left them.</span> <span id="s386">They were in La Paz, and then he went -- he had a job in a jungle for two years with a brewing company in Cochabamba, which is also BoliviA:</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did he stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: He stayed there for two years.</span> <span id="s389">I think he came back.</span> <span id="s390">Had lost a terrible amount of weight.</span> <span id="s391">Just a very hardship kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Did he eventually move to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: He came to the U.S. I think a year before I got married, which was '48.</span> <span id="s394">So he must have come in '47.</span> <span id="s395">And then he went to school here.</span> <span id="s396">He went to Rensselaer.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Overall, what was your -- would you say your experience in England with your foster family was positive?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah, it was definitely positive.</span> <span id="s399">I mean, the flip side was, you know, I felt that I always had to be a good girl because if I didn't walk the straight and narrow, then -- a lot of kids got kicked out of their foster homes, from reading all these various books.</span> <span id="s400">Have you read -- well, there are a whole lot of them.</span> <span id="s401">What's the name?</span> <span id="s402">Siegel wrote a book?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Lorrie Siegel, yes.</span> <span id="s405">And then there was one about a home for Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s406">I forget what that was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Lorrie Siegel wrote the book in other people's homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes, you're right.</span> <span id="s409">I think she was in different foster homes.</span> <span id="s410">So you know, I think that -- and I probably had a tendency to be a good girl anyway.</span> <span id="s411">Those were my father's expectations.</span> <span id="s412">It was very strict.</span> <span id="s413">And there was that.</span> <span id="s414">And then they didn't really get it.</span> <span id="s415">I remember my foster mother saying, when I was about 16, she said -- she asked me whether I wouldn't want to convert.</span> <span id="s416">And I said -- she said, "Because then you wouldn't have any trouble and then all your problems were because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s417">If there weren't any Jewish people, there wouldn't be any problems."</span> <span id="s418">It was something naive like that.</span> <span id="s419">It wasn't anti Semitic.</span> <span id="s420">It was naive, I think.</span> <span id="s421">And I was very hurt and angry about that.</span> <span id="s422">And I remember that being the first and, I think, the only time I must admit that I fasted on Yom Kippur, just to prove that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s423">Not that they ever knew about it or cared, but I felt better for doing that.</span> <span id="s424">And I think I had to prove to myself.</span> <span id="s425">But basically it was that I think they had led a rather insulated life and didn't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: There weren't any other Jewish people in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Well, eventually, when I was 16 I graduated,high school and I got a job.</span> <span id="s428">I found that there wasmfree Austria organization or something and that they were young people who eventually intended to go back to AustriA: Jewish people.</span> <span id="s429">And they were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s430">It was kind of a group leader, a woman and her husband.</span> <span id="s431">They were also Jewish.</span> <span id="s432">Their name was Leichner.</span> <span id="s433">And so then I started associating with Jewish kids, and that became rather insular.</span> <span id="s434">That was a rather left-wing group.</span> <span id="s435">We read Karl Marx and all kinds of discussions and stuff.</span> <span id="s436">But it felt more like I belonged than the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Do you recall when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Well, I came over here before the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: My mother made application for hardship reasons in New York and got me.</span> <span id="s441">I came here the year of 1944, November '44, on a ship that took two weeks on the convoy.</span> <span id="s442">And I was so seasick.</span> <span id="s443">But she was able to get me to here.</span> <span id="s444">And so then I remember -- I don't know where I was.</span> <span id="s445">But the war ended a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: What was it like leaving your foster family?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Well, I had left earlier, actually.</span> <span id="s448">I had left probably a year or two before I came to the States because I got -- my second job was -- my first job was at an egg grading station.</span> <span id="s449">And my second job was for the Signal Corps because the Signal Corps had come to the -- the U.S. Signal Corps, because they had come to Britain and made their headquarters in Cheltenham at the time.</span> <span id="s450">And since my foster mother made me take typing and shorthand, when I graduated high school, I got a job, a secretarial job there.</span> <span id="s451">And I made quite a few friends.</span> <span id="s452">And when those guys left to go to London to go to the Grosvenor House, I went with.</span> <span id="s453">And I more or less said good-bye to them at that time.</span> <span id="s454">And that was probably in the spring of '44.</span> <span id="s455">I think I was in London maybe six months.</span> <span id="s456">I got an apartment.</span> <span id="s457">So I said good-bye at that time.</span> <span id="s458">And then my husband and I went back one time many years later.</span> <span id="s459">And my foster father had died.</span> <span id="s460">And she was living in a nursing home and had pretty advanced Alzheimer's so that she didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s461">But she eventually did.</span> <span id="s462">My husband, he was very good with her, and he was able to somehow refresh her memory.</span> <span id="s463">Either that or she pretended.</span> <span id="s464">And also when I came to this country, one of the first things I did was her daughter and husband lived in Alexandria here.</span> <span id="s465">And I went down to see them and meet them, and we corresponded.</span> <span id="s466">We sent Christmas letters to each other until she died last year.</span> <span id="s467">So that was what, 40, 50 years or something.</span> <span id="s468">So she just died recently.</span> <span id="s469">She was 10 years older than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So you were able to emigrate to America in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Right.</span> <span id="s472">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: And what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: November, just before Thanksgiving, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: What was it like coming to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Well, again, overwhelming.</span> <span id="s477">And I really didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s478">As much as I wanted to see my mother, I felt I had friends there and roots there.</span> <span id="s479">And it was another wrench.</span> <span id="s480">But then also my mother and I had some difficulty at first.</span> <span id="s481">First of all, living in small quarters.</span> <span id="s482">And I think she was getting her little girl back.</span> <span id="s483">That's what she thought.</span> <span id="s484">And I was 18 and felt grown up and independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: How long had you been -- was it like four --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I think five years, five and a half.</span> <span id="s487">It was quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: It took some adjusting?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yeah, it did take some adjusting.</span> <span id="s490">Yes.</span> <span id="s491">Yeah.</span> <span id="s492">And then I had a kind of mentor, a friend of my father's who was also a lawyer and who worked for a big company in New York.</span> <span id="s493">And they were friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s494">And so when he heard that I was coming he said he would get me a job.</span> <span id="s495">And he immediately got me a secretarial job at this company on 6th Avenue, Rockefeller Center.</span> <span id="s496">And he said, "Well, of course you'll go to college.</span> <span id="s497">"Because there had never been any talk of -- when you graduate high school 16 and there is no money, you don't talk about going to college.</span> <span id="s498">I don't think I ever thought further than a day ahead of what I was going to do or what I was going to be or anything.</span> <span id="s499">It was all survival.</span> <span id="s500">So he got me this job and he said, "Of course you'll go to college."</span> <span id="s501">I said, "Oh, I will?"</span> <span id="s502">And he referred me to the Office for International Education.</span> <span id="s503">And I could have one of two scholarships, one to the University of Miami in Ohio and one at the University of Michigan.</span> <span id="s504">Somehow I picked the University of Michigan and had a room-and-board scholarship at a Jewish sorority and an academic scholarship.</span> <span id="s505">So a year later I -- oh, and I had to take a couple of courses to catch up in American history, which of course I needed, and intermediate algebra, of which I was very weak.</span> <span id="s506">And so I came to Ann Arbor.</span> <span id="s507">The person I admired most there is my mother, that she was able to let me go again and said she wanted to do this, that she wanted me to do this.</span> <span id="s508">Because I think if she had been, "Oh, poor me, you're leaving me" kind of thing, I probably wouldn't have gone.</span> <span id="s509">So that was good.</span> <span id="s510">And so that was another adjustment.</span> <span id="s511">It's been one after the other.</span> <span id="s512">And then I had this room-and-board scholarship at this Jewish sorority.</span> <span id="s513">So I was not a member, not that I ever wanted to be in a sorority.</span> <span id="s514">But nevertheless, I had a room of my own.</span> <span id="s515">And I made a couple of good friends there.</span> <span id="s516">But nevertheless, I was, again, on the outside, even though everybody was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Were there other students who had this similar experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No, I was the only student.</span> <span id="s519">That's a big expensive deal.</span> <span id="s520">So that was hard.</span> <span id="s521">And then the summer I left in a co-op and made co-op friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did you meet your husband in Michigan?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yeah, I met my husband in Michigan.</span> <span id="s524">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Mort.</span> <span id="s527">Mort Leitson.</span> <span id="s528">He was a law student and was active in the National Lawyers Guild and I was active in some other things and we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well, actually, I majored in English lit.</span> <span id="s531">I wanted to major in sociology, which I thought I – I knew I wanted to go into social work.</span> <span id="s532">I don't know how I knew this, but I did know.</span> <span id="s533">And the adviser had said -- at that time, they didn't have an undergraduate social work school, which they do now.</span> <span id="s534">And so I said I wanted to major in sociology.</span> <span id="s535">And he said the sociology department is so bad, don't do that.</span> <span id="s536">Major in English.</span> <span id="s537">So what did I know?</span> <span id="s538">So I majored in English lit.</span> <span id="s539">And eventually much later I went back to graduate school and did what I really wanted to.</span> <span id="s540">So I met him.</span> <span id="s541">And he graduated a year before I did.</span> <span id="s542">And he was from Flint, Michigan.</span> <span id="s543">It's a good town to be from.</span> <span id="s544">And so we got married during my last year of school and we had an apartment in Ann Arbor.</span> <span id="s545">He would kind of commute back and forth.</span> <span id="s546">And then I moved to Flint, which I didn't want to do.</span> <span id="s547">Originally he said we would live in Denver because he had such a good time there in the Army.</span> <span id="s548">But then when he was home for that year, his parents had a bakery and his name was well-known.</span> <span id="s549">He realized that it was much easier to be in your own practice when your name is known as not.</span> <span id="s550">And so we stayed there.</span> <span id="s551">And that was a very different family.</span> <span id="s552">It was an eastern Polish family, and they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s553">They weren't Polish, but they were from there.</span> <span id="s554">They were first-generation, his parents were.</span> <span id="s555">And for them, I wasn't Jewish enough, for my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s556">I wasn't Jewish enough.</span> <span id="s557">I didn't have enough money -- or any money.</span> <span id="s558">But we got over that hump.</span> <span id="s559">My father-in-law was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s560">My mother-in-law was a very nice woman, too, but very determined.</span> <span id="s561">So anyway, it was a good town to raise our kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: How many children did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Three.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: What are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Karen, who is here, is my oldest; and Mark is in the middle; and Ruth, Ruth Leah is an artist down in Asheville, North CarolinA:</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And your mother stayed on Long Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: She stayed on Long Island until four years before she died, when she came to her cousin, really.</span> <span id="s568">She didn't say she was unhappy in New York.</span> <span id="s569">I don't think she was, actually.</span> <span id="s570">But everybody was getting older.</span> <span id="s571">And even her friends -- New York is hard to get around in.</span> <span id="s572">And everybody was getting older and her doctors' offices were in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s573">Everything was a chore.</span> <span id="s574">She was just getting too old for New York.</span> <span id="s575">And so I really didn't want her to live with me, nor did she want to any more than I want to live with my children.</span> <span id="s576">We did find her an apartment right near my house, and that really worked out very well.</span> <span id="s577">In the end, I was very glad I did that or we did that.</span> <span id="s578">It was a very nice, tiny apartment, but she was very happy there.</span> <span id="s579">She could come and have meals with us and go on vacation and so forth.</span> <span id="s580">So that worked out well.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Did you ever speak to your mother about what it was like for her to send you on the Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Not afterwards.</span> <span id="s583">I don't think -- She did it, and she did it as good or as well as could be expected.</span> <span id="s584">I don't think we talked about it afterwards.</span> <span id="s585">She must have been very strong if she could send me -- allow me to get away again.</span> <span id="s586">So that was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: You said that your children have interviewed you like this in the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Well, we're working at it.</span> <span id="s589">There's never enough time when we get together.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So you've spoken to them about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Do you have grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s594">My one granddaughter is coming, the oldest, who is 32.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Have you ever -- have they asked about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s597">I mean, she has seen the movie and read the book and asked.</span> <span id="s598">We've talked.</span> <span id="s599">Yeah.</span> <span id="s600">Everybody -- I spoke at my grandson's school in Chicago one time.</span> <span id="s601">So I realize that a lot of people in my generation have not talked about their experiences, but I think it's people who have lived through horrendous things and just couldn't talk about them.</span> <span id="s602">But in our family, it was okay.</span> <span id="s603">Maybe later.</span> <span id="s604">Not when they were little, but later.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add about --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: No, not particularly.</span> <span id="s607">Is there anything you
