Jack.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Answer: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Nice to see you here.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Likewise.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s9">Jack, what was your name when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: My name was Jurgen Jakob Bassfreund.</span> <span id="s11">The name Jakob was given to me as a Jewish name because my grandfather’s name -- he w-was a rabbi with a title of a doctor, and he -- his name was Jakob Bassfreund.</span> <span id="s12">And s-since he was deceased already when I was born, I -- this was given to me as a middle name, as a Jewish name, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s14">And Jurgen, where does that come from, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Well Jurgen is -- I don’t know how my mother ever got the idea.</span> <span id="s16">My father said, “How co -- what happens if he really looks Jewish, and you give him the name Jurgen, and he will find out [indecipherable] look Jewish, and he can’t be named Jurgen.”</span> <span id="s17">Jurgen is actually a Danish name, I believe, it’s -- it -- it’s a na -- George in Danish, or something to that effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And did they call you Jurgen?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: No, they used to call me Bubchen, which means little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Bubchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s23">That was cute.</span> <span id="s24">When -- when were you born, what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: On September the 30th, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And you were born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I was born in Bernkastel, at the Mosel River.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: At the where?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Mosel -- Mosel.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Mosel.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Oh, it’s a -- it’s near -- it’s near the river?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: It’s on the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: It’s called Bernkastel on the Mosel.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s38">And it’s very famous for its wines.</span> <span id="s39">In fact, you can almost go in every per -- pe -- wine store here in this country, and you’ll find wine from Bernkastel.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s41">Did you grow up in Bernkastel, or in -- or in --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: No, not in Bernkastel proper.</span> <span id="s43">We lived about two miles, or three miles out of Bernkastel, in a small village I would say, it’s called Muhlheim.</span> <span id="s44">That’s where we lived, that’s where my father’s practice was.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: And your father was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: A medical doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: A medical doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So how come you were born in Bernkastel?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, this -- when my mother gave birth to my sister, she screamed, so she was ashamed to give birth at the hou -- in the house, and this was the only hospital around, was in Bernkastel.</span> <span id="s51">It was a Catholic hospital, I remember there were all nuns there.</span> <span id="s52">And also my father used to have his patients in there, my father also did surgery.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I -- removing -- a-a-appendectomies, and operations of that kind.</span> <span id="s55">Heart operations weren’t done in those days --</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: -- days, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: So how did you find out that that was the reason why you were born in Bernkastel?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Because my mother told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Your mother told you this.</span> <span id="s61">Now, you had an older sister, Ilsa, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And she was how many years older than you?</span> <span id="s64">She was --</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: She was born in 1921, which would make her two years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Two years older, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: She is in California now.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: She lives in ba -- Huntington Beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span> <span id="s71">But I want to get a little bit of a sense of your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: -- life.</span> <span id="s74">So tell me about your father.</span> <span id="s75">He was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Were you close with him?</span> <span id="s78">I -- I un -- when you were a little boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: He did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Yo -- your father was a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s83">Were you close with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s85">My father was a very loving father.</span> <span id="s86">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: -- yeah, he doted on us --</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: -- I must say, yeah.</span> <span id="s91">And my father used to put, let’s say, for instance Lindt chocolates on our night tables, and things like that.</span> <span id="s92">He was a very good father.</span> <span id="s93">He was very -- he was a good man, too, he had -- I remember I ha -- ga -- my father used to also buy -- when I bought a pair -- he bought a suit for me, he would also buy the chauffeur’s son a suit, and he used to buy schoolbooks for -- for him and for me.</span> <span id="s94">A very good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: So he was a generous man.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: In fact, I understand that there were underpriv -- some o-of his underprivileged patients, who didn’t even have any electricity, that my father used to put -- put electricity, and had it charged to him, because he had to see what he was doing, you know, and besides that, he felt that people have got to have electricity, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: So he was a generous person?</span> <span id="s98">Generous?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: He --</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: He -- he was generous.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yeah, very generous.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Very generous man.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did he have a good sense of humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Oh yeah, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Is that where you got your sense of humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s108">I guess I have a pretty decent sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Now, did he have in -- his office was in Muhlheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s111">He had his office in Muhlheim, and he moved in -- I think it was 1930, yeah, he moved into a new house, we had a 14 room house, and the practice was in that building, on the side entrance, and there was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: -- was the practice there.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So, did you go for walks with your father, or did you build --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh yes I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: My father had very little time, because during ha -- in those days doctors used to do house calls, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: It wasn’t like today, the only doctor came in the house is Dr. Pepper.</span> <span id="s120">But in those years, they -- my father was called out day and night.</span> <span id="s121">In fact, we had a telephone line going direct to the chauffeur’s house, and if my father had to go somewhere, he would ring up, and he would come and pick him up wi-with the car and take him to the patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Now, I understand that your father was not the best driver, is that why he had a chauffeur?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Oh yeah, he was a horrible driver.</span> <span id="s124">I don’t -- I never drove with him, but maybe I wouldn’t be here today if I would have.</span> <span id="s125">My mother said that he drove once, and that he almost ended up in a ravine, or something.</span> <span id="s126">And she said, “You can’t drive no more, this is it.”</span> <span id="s127">She said, “You better hire somebody to,” -- because in the beginning, when my father first started out, he used to go to [indecipherable] day he had to go to the woods there, and things like that -- they had wild boars in that area too, you know, in the woods.</span> <span id="s128">So it was kind of a risky situation.</span> <span id="s129">And it’s better to go by car, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: -- than walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: So does this mean that you were fairly wealthy, because you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Ba -- by American standards, I don’t think that my father was very wealthy.</span> <span id="s134">I mean, we didn’t have a -- a yacht in the ocean, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s135">My father was very hard working man, and he very seldom took a vacation.</span> <span id="s136">I remember even when my mother was -- would take us on vacations to the Black Forest, or most of the time we used to go out of -- out of the country, because there was a lot of anti-Semitism, especially in do -- in places near the -- near the North Sea where the Germans had the ba -- the ba -- spas, and places.</span> <span id="s137">The fact was that the Jewish newspaper in Germany used to print every year a book that have places where Jews are not wanted.</span> <span id="s138">And they listed all these restaurants and hotels that did not cater to Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And this is before Hitler came?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yeah, that was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: In fact, i-it’s -- I don’t know whether it’s now and here, there is a -- a place called Norderney, which is -- I think it’s on the bal -- is it on the b -- I think it’s on the Baltic.</span> <span id="s143">And -- or maybe it’s on the North Sea, I’d -- I’m not sure now.</span> <span id="s144">And they never allowed Jews in -- in that town.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Wh-What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Manfred, M-a-n-f-r-e-d, Manfred Bassfreund.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And was -- was he equally doting on your sister as well as you --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: -- he was close to both of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yeah, yeah, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: What -- uh-huh.</span> <span id="s152">Was he interested in music?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s156">I remember that -- I remember the old Caruso records that we had.</span> <span id="s157">In those years, used to have a crank tha -- a crank up phonograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: It was a [indecipherable] though.</span> <span id="s160">And he had Caruso records, he had symphonies, but in those days the symphonies came, each movement was on a separate record, of course.</span> <span id="s161">So I’m -- I remember we had Beethoven’s First, the first movement, and we had the opera recordings, so of course tha -- in those days you didn’t have complete operas.</span> <span id="s162">There were arias, or duets, or so on and so forth, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: So you grew up as a youngster hearing a lot of classical music?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Oh yeah, I did, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And did he teach -- did -- did you listen together and he taught you about the music?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah, he taught me about the music, and we listened together.</span> <span id="s167">And he also -- I remember in those years, in 1932, came out for the first time, a German encyclopedia in one volume, A to Z, and it was a very good one, was wa -- well made, and he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s168">And I used to love to look up things when I list -- listened to Verdi, I would look up Verdi.</span> <span id="s169">When I was listening to Meyerbeer, I would look up Meyerbeer.</span> <span id="s170">And I learned a lot from it, you know?</span> <span id="s171">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Did you also listen to popular music, or it was strictly classical music?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: No, I would say strictly classical -- I’m still to -- well -- I’m still today not a great friend of -- of popular music.</span> <span id="s174">I mean, my wife is a big enthusiast of jazz, and you can ask her almost anything, she can tell you when Louis Armstrong had a headache, almost, but my -- I am not really into it so much.</span> <span id="s175">I can listen to it a certain time, but after awhile, it seems to me very monotonous.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s177">And do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I guess I’m not that -- understanding it too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Do you have particular instrumental favorites, or is [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: No, I would say I’m very fond of the violin, the cello, piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s182">Did you go to concerts as a kid, were there concerts in Muhlheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: We had a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: In fact, that this is the one good thing I got to say about Germany, almost every little town had an opera house there.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: In Trier has an opera house, I mean all tare -- also used to give plays in that but they -- but we had to -- I remember a ber -- a -- a gentleman, we were friendly, my sister was friendly with his daughter, he was a heldentenor.</span> <span id="s188">A heldentenor is somebody who does the Wagnerian waltzes, the real strong voice, tenor, you know.</span> <span id="s189">You have to be for Wagner.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: And yeah, I heard a lot of bar -- good concerts and operas.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Tell me about your mother, what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Her name was Irma Bodenheimer by birth.</span> <span id="s194">Irma Bodenheimer [indecipherable] Irma Bassfreund.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Burma?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: This is wa -- how my daughter got the name Irma.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Our oldest one.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And tell me something about your mother, what was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: My -- my mother was -- I was not as close with my mother as wi-with my father, I -- I can truly say.</span> <span id="s203">I think my mother was not as patient and as loving a person as my father was.</span> <span id="s204">But of course she was my mother, you know, and you have no -- no options why --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: So, I can’t say anything bad about her, but I sh -- remember my father more fondly than my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Was she a disciplinarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yeah, among other things, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What are the other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: You know what, I -- what I mean to say is just, in Europe when a woman is married to an MD, she has the feeling as if she’s part an MD as well, because the woman is usually called Frau Doktor, which is stupid because she’s not a doctor, not at all.</span> <span id="s211">My mother Wa -- didn’t -- ma -- my mother was not stupid, but she didn’t have the brain capacity to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s212">And this isn’t -- she used to walk around, you can see even, in one picture.</span> <span id="s213">She used to have what is called an esculap, I don’t know whether you know what an esculap is.</span> <span id="s214">An esculap is a snake winding around -- I think was a sign of a doctor.</span> <span id="s215">And she had a brooch with a diamond in it that she always wore.</span> <span id="s216">So you would know that she had something to do with the medical profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: But she didn’t work?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s219">She didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s221">And did they get along okay, your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: This was the bad part about it, because since she didn’t work, she could dedicate more time of this discipline [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Did your mother and father get along, do you think?</span> <span id="s224">From what you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes, to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s226">My mother was a little bit on the jealous side, and so on, so -- but this is not neither here nor there.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I mean, I think she’s not the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s230">And how about your sister?</span> <span id="s231">Your sister’s two years older than you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Were you close?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Oh yeah, we are still close.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: You’re still close.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I still call my sister almost every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s239">In fact, I just called her prior to leaving, and yeah, we talk on the phone, and reminisce, whatever we remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did you play together?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Oh yeah, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Because often when the -- when you have a si -- a sister or brother who is a couple of years older, they don’t want to have anything to do with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: No, I loved -- my sister always let me win the games, and I was very happy about that, so I played a lot with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I remember playing with her, she used to have beautiful dolls, and I used to play doctor.</span> <span id="s248">I used to get the -- some p -- p -- hypodermic needles, and things, and I used to give them injections.</span> <span id="s249">The dolls were full of water, which my sister did not appreciate at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So you actually put water in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yeah, in the -- in the syringe, you know, and I si -- injected them.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: So in your head do you think you were practicing to become a doctor, is that what you thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yeah, I think so, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did you ever go into the office with your father, and watch [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: No, we didn’t th -- we didn’t.</span> <span id="s256">The only thing I remember in those years, I used to get ultraviolet rays, and my -- my father had an ultraviolet -- what do you call them, sunlamp, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: It was a big contraption a -- in those days, and it -- there was like a -- a leather sofa, you had to lie down on it, and I don’t know how long, two or three minutes, whatever, you had to wear goggles, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: And what was the purpose?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I don’t think even that it’s that healthy, I mean, can cause cancer and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And you -- you did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: I did it, yeah, my pur -- my father thought it was beneficial.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: In those years, the concept of healing a person was completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I think se -- sa -- in those years people did things that are absolutely wrong to do.</span> <span id="s267">I used to gar -- get sick very often because probably due to the fact that my father saw [indecipherable] patients, and probably some of the germs carried over into the house or whatever.</span> <span id="s268">I used to have a sore throat every hour, so to speak.</span> <span id="s269">And in those years, when someone had fever, they would give them something like aspirin, and then they would take a wet cloth, and wrap you up in it, and you had to sweat in that.</span> <span id="s270">Which is wrong because it causes people to get pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: And a -- I -- I remember distinctly, I had quite a lot of sickness when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s273">I even had scarlet fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s276">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So they wrapped you in a wet li -- like a towel over your entire body?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yeah, not wa -- two or three times a day, yeah.</span> <span id="s279">And I hated -- I used to scream my head off, but they had no mercy.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: No mercy.</span> <span id="s281">And this was a hot towel, in order to make you sweat?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yeah, it was a hot towel, yeah.</span> <span id="s283">And it was soaking wet.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: And then they put a dry one around it, on top of it, and you had to lay there, and if you were lucky somebody would read you a story, and if not, you just screamed --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: -- just [indecipherable] screaming --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: -- till they took you out after th -- an hour or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Did your sister get sick as often as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Not as often, but she also got, once in awhile, she also used to get what they used to call the wickel in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: The wickel?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Because wickel means to wind up -- to wind around, you know.</span> <span id="s292">You were wrapped up in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s294">Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Do you remember going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: No, I -- I don’t -- I liked school, but I never remember that I went to school where there was no anti-Semitism there.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I mean, already in 1930, the Nazis had a way of getting -- teach na -- national Socialist teachers into the s -- s-school op -- system.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: And I remember that there was a German poem, where it was about a tree which wanted to change it’s leave, and then God gave him golden leaves, and when the golden leaves [indecipherable], a Jew went through the forest, and he saw the golden leaves, and he took them all off in a big sack, he came in with a big beard and sack.</span> <span id="s302">And every time when I -- when this part of the ballad was supposed to be said, he -- the teacher would call on me to say it, you know?</span> <span id="s303">And the kids didn’t want to play with me any more.</span> <span id="s304">And when -- I remember even before I went to school, usually when kids fought they used to call each other idiot, or donkey, or ape, or whatever.</span> <span id="s305">[indecipherable] called you a dirty Jew, you know?</span> <span id="s306">And it got worse and worse, of course, and so we had to -- in fact, I remember that the school teacher I had used to smoke Nazi cigarettes.</span> <span id="s307">There was one company in germ -- you know, the Nazis always had for a -- for all their things, these forceful names.</span> <span id="s308">Like, the black core was the SS newspaper.</span> <span id="s309">Der Sturmer, or the storm man, you know?</span> <span id="s310">And the attack -- the [indecipherable] -- the attack.</span> <span id="s311">And these cigarettes were called Trommlers, and they came, of course, in a brown packing with an SA insignia on it.</span> <span id="s312">And he used to smoke them.</span> <span id="s313">I hope he got cancer from them.</span> <span id="s314">But he smoked them constantly, he was a chain smoker.</span> <span id="s315">And they infiltrated the system.</span> <span id="s316">This was -- I would say that maybe the National Socialists used the most -- the cleverest way of fooling people, and getting -- getting their system working.</span> <span id="s317">Because they did it without you knowing about it, you were -- all of a sudden somebody appeared in school, he tried to get the kids to enlist in the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s318">And then they used to send -- my father was hated by them, but of course, my father, every time when s -- when they -- they -- they tried to assemble, and somebody would speak, my father told the owner of the restaurant, he said, “If you let them speak, I will tell the Jewish people not to buy wine from you.”</span> <span id="s319">And then they cancelled it, of course, because they would have lost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s320">But of course he was on -- on their black list, on their hate list.</span> <span id="s321">And I remember that every time when they used to come and march past our house, they would raise the Nazi flag high up for us to see it, you know?</span> <span id="s322">In other words to say, once we get there, we are going to take care of you, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: So you remember this a -- as a young kid of --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: -- six or seven year -- w-would you say you do -- would --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I remember when I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s329">I have a good memory.</span> <span id="s330">I don’t remember before today what I ate for breakfast, but the order of the -- the things that had happened years ago, I remember very distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s332">Do you re -- do you remember talking about this at home?</span> <span id="s333">Do -- did you come home and say they called me dirty Jew, what are they -- what are they saying?</span> <span id="s334">This must be --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Oh, they couldn’t do -- what could they do?</span> <span id="s336">They couldn’t do much about it.</span> <span id="s337">My father ba -- would go to the teacher and complain.</span> <span id="s338">You see, my father also used to do in school the vaccinations when we had [indecipherable], and my vaccination is still from a -- done from my father, you know?</span> <span id="s339">I don’t know what kind of vaccination it was, every year, I think -- you know, I was once -- once -- when you went to school, you -- you got vaccinated.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s341">So he would go and talk to the teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s343">Probably did -- did -- you just -- you couldn’t really do much about it, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: -- it’s what -- they weren’t themselves, and you know they -- they shout up at places where you wouldn’t think they would.</span> <span id="s346">You know, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: So, in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: An infiltration type of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: -- in Muhlheim, what was the population of Jews and Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: You could count them on your fingers.</span> <span id="s351">I would say in Muhlheim, there were maybe, all told 15 - 16 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: That’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Out of a population of what, a few thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No, not even that, a population of a thousand, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: So it’s really tiny?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s360">A tiny, tiny place.</span> <span id="s361">Very, very pic -- picturesque, and very pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: So it must have been very uncomfortable then, growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: It was very uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I could really, truly say that I grew up with an inferiority complex.</span> <span id="s366">Because here we got all the time, and think -- you really almost thought that you really were inferior to other people, because they always talked about it.</span> <span id="s367">You know, you got -- you got to think.</span> <span id="s368">And it wasn’t easy to grow up in this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s370">Did you all eat dinner together?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah, we did, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s373">Did you eat lunch as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: I would say whenever my father had time to join us at dinner, he would.</span> <span id="s375">And I remember my father sitting at the head of the table, and we kids would sit left and right, or next seat -- beside of, on the side, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And your mother would sit at the other end?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: And who cooked, did your mother cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, we had a maid who cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: You had a maid who cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s382">And my mother might have been cooking, I think my mother thought she was a good cook, because she always said she made this cake and she made this cake, but my sister is two years older, she says she just didn’t make that cake, our maid made that cake.</span> <span id="s383">So I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And what is --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: My mother -- my sister was not too fond of my mother to begin with, and wo -- yeah, she probably -- I -- I guess maybe the maid really did make the cake.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s387">And what was dinner like?</span> <span id="s388">Did you have conversations, or was it very quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: It was always s-something spoken about that was of interest.</span> <span id="s392">My father did not re -- we did not have to si -- just plain talks, there was some kind of sub -- subject.</span> <span id="s393">I remember once asking my father why the river flows in a direction.</span> <span id="s394">And he said, let’s all think about it, and let’s try to come up with an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: And then it finally dawned on me, I said it must come from a mountain, that’s why it’s always going in one direct --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And the -- so he says, yeah, this is the reason why.</span> <span id="s398">Because they usually always start in the mountainous areas, like the Mosel starts in -- in Vosges, and the -- the Rhine, this -- or is it the Rhine that starts [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s399">Now, the Mosel -- the Rhine is set -- in St. Totthard in Switzerland, I believe starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: And -- but they all start from mountainous areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Did you have a favorite food, as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Not really, when it comes to food I wouldn’t -- well, I still adhere to the German foods a lot.</span> <span id="s406">Like, I like liverwurst for breakfast.</span> <span id="s407">I make toast, I let it melt on there.</span> <span id="s408">I like that.</span> <span id="s409">And I got a big surprise at my birthday when my daughter send me lunke -- you know what a landjager is?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Well, a landjager is some kind of a salami that looks as if somebody sat on it, it’s flat, and it’s very tasty.</span> <span id="s412">And she sent me four, and I saved --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Four?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: -- one, and I gave it [indecipherable] and said to my daughter when she brought me to the airport, and one other thing.</span> <span id="s415">And I like -- there’s one place in -- in Birmingham that specializes in foreign food, so to speak, but it’s not like up north, I mean, up north they gets a prolific amount of foods that they can buy from --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I like French cheese, I’m a great lover of cheese.</span> <span id="s418">I have to have cheese with every breakfast.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s421">It could be a b -- a fromage de bleu, or blue cheese, whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s422">Camembert brie, Swiss cheese.</span> <span id="s423">And every time I take it, my wife looks at me, oh my God, look at the calories, 75 -- this, and cholesterol 25, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you grow up in a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yeah, my father was extremely religious, due to the fact that my grandfather was religious.</span> <span id="s426">My grandfather you can see on the internet.</span> <span id="s427">He -- he was a -- he translated fragments of the -- the Aramaic Pentateuch, I don’t know what they call that in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Five books of Moses.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s430">From Aramaic into Hebrew into German, yeah.</span> <span id="s431">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Is that Jakob?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Pardon.</span> <span id="s434">I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Is that the person you were named after?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Jakob?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Jakob, Jakob?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Jakob was, yeah, that’s my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: That’s -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s441">And I never met my grandfather, he was already deceased when I was born, but I also never met the grandfather on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s442">I might my -- met my grandmother on my mother’s side, and that’s about the only grandparents I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: So what do you mean when -- when I ask you the question, were you religious, what does that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Well, I wasn’t religious, we -- I had to be religious.</span> <span id="s445">My father was fluent in Hebrew, and on the high holidays, there was a synagogue about a mile out of town, and he would take over the -- the -- the part of the Chassan, and pray, you know, before -- of course he didn’t get paid for it, but he was to relieve the Chassan, that he, you know, that has to pray all day long on Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: And therefore he used to, so to speak, help out, you know.</span> <span id="s448">He said -- we said grace every day, for every meal, my father would say.</span> <span id="s449">And of course on Passover, he would read the Haggadah, and he [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: And you would -- did you observe the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s452">I was not allowed to write on -- on -- on the Sabbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I mean, write with a pencil.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s457">He was very religious, almost to the point of being uncomfortable because I was at -- my mother was not brought up that religious.</span> <span id="s458">I mean, she -- she observed the holidays, and we had of course the kosher household, because my father would have insisted on it.</span> <span id="s459">He probably did insist upon it.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: But after my father -- my father passed away, it became, unusually fast, un-kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Tell me what happened, your dad -- your father died in 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, he died due to an appendectomy, he waited too long.</span> <span id="s466">My mother was -- and my sister were on vaca -- were on vaca -- my mother was on vacation with my sister, she visited her relatives in Saarbrucken, which is near the French border there, on the -- she had a brother there, and a sister, brother-in-law and so forth.</span> <span id="s467">And my father wanted to wait till she came back, he wasn’t -- I remember he wasn’t feel good, I remember he -- for a doctor unusual things he took [indecipherable] extract, and he knew that wouldn’t help.</span> <span id="s468">[indecipherable] an appendectomy.</span> <span id="s469">When he finally was at -- my mother was -- went by train, and the chauffeur picked her up, because the -- the regular railway station was also about a half an hour away from where we lived.</span> <span id="s470">And it was too late, he developed a thrombosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And he died.</span> <span id="s473">He was 42.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So he was such a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: That must have been a big shock to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: It was, it was, indeed, it was a shock to all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: And then already that was in ’32, in 30 -- ’32 anti-Semitism became already very openly in -- in Muhlheim.</span> <span id="s480">It was practiced on the open basis, because they all joined the Hitler youth, and were a few, they wanted to make Muhlheim free of Jews already in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: So my mother moved to Trier with us.</span> <span id="s483">We sold the house -- course, we lost a lot of money on that house.</span> <span id="s484">It was a big house -- was a 14 room house, and it had a beautiful garden.</span> <span id="s485">And I remember we had a terrace on top of the -- the garage, it was so huge that I used to ride my little car on it, you know?</span> <span id="s486">I had a little kiddie car.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: We’re gonna -- we’re gonna have to stop to change the tape, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s489">It gives me a chance to have a little drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: We ended the last tape when you began to talk about moving to Trier, but I want to ask you whether you remember your -- the funeral of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yeah, I certainly do remember.</span> <span id="s495">The funeral of my father, which took place in 1933 -- two, there were thousands of people lined up to see -- he was interred in Trier of course, because I don’t know, my father said he doesn’t want to be buried in a Jewish cemetery in Muhlheim, because it was out of th-things -- my mother wouldn’t have had the chances to go and visit the grave, and all that.</span> <span id="s496">So he was interred in -- in Trier.</span> <span id="s497">And people lined up, because my father was beloved in those years, you know?</span> <span id="s498">He had many patients, he saved many lives, and he was very well loved.</span> <span id="s499">We had also two more doctors in this little horse village there.</span> <span id="s500">One was a drunk.</span> <span id="s501">He had a mistress, and he was standing -- always going hunting with her in the lo -- hunting lodges in the forest.</span> <span id="s502">The other one was -- he was a good do -- I -- I guess he was all right, but he didn’t have -- my father was the busiest of the three, because he was always there.</span> <span id="s503">Not because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s504">They [indecipherable] forgot he was Jewish, and [indecipherable] took everything away from the others, which wasn’t the truth.</span> <span id="s505">The others were -- were not there, I mean, a -- a person go -- is -- get sick, he’s going to go to the hunting lodge, you know, to find the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s507">So who comforted you about your father’s death, did anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Our chauffeur.</span> <span id="s509">I remember he came from the hospital, and I still see he sat down on a sofa that we had in our den, so to speak, it was called a den to -- there was a radio in [indecipherable], and he took me on one lap, and my sister as well, and he said, “Your dad passed away,” and -- and he was -- he was crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: You know, he felt very bad about it.</span> <span id="s512">And I can truly say he’s one of the new Nazis that I -- now I saw him after the war, and he almost got in a concentration camp because he went into a store and he said good morning.</span> <span id="s513">There was a woman who said, “It’s not good morning any more, it’s heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s514">And he said, “What happened to the good morning?”</span> <span id="s515">And that woman was very upset about that, you know, the Germans loved him.</span> <span id="s516">There was actually -- this was almost a sexual affair the women had with him.</span> <span id="s517">I mean, he was certainly nothing to look at.</span> <span id="s518">He looked like an idiot.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: And the women were crazy, that’s why he’s -- he never got married.</span> <span id="s521">He was married to all the German women.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did your mother comfort you also, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I don’t remember my mother comforting me really.</span> <span id="s524">My mother wasn’t of a comforting nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: That’s right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: She was a mother liked to hobnob with society.</span> <span id="s527">I remember we lived in Trier, above us, our apartment was the French consulate.</span> <span id="s528">And my mother was friendly with the French consul’s wife, and they used to play cards together.</span> <span id="s529">I saw -- I can truly say that our maid actually raised me, more or less --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Thank God -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: -- because my mother was not often at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: So that -- so that you -- your father’s death was -- left an enormous hole in your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: It did, it did, it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: -- because of how -- of how much he meant to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: After -- and ma -- my sister’s as well, because my sister was even more -- even closer to my father.</span> <span id="s536">In fact, my sister at one time used to just go in my parent’s bedroom, and fell asleep on the bed, and she slept there all night, because she was always close to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s538">So you moved from -- from Muhlheim to Trier --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: -- a year after your father died, or is it less?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I don’t think it was -- less, I think it was less than a year.</span> <span id="s542">I tell you why I say this, because I remember that I was in Trier at the time when Hitler became chancellor, which was on the 30th of January, 1933, and my father died in ’32, in April, so it couldn’t have been more --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: -- than maybe seven -- six, seven, eight months, something to that effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: And is the major reason why your mother decided to leave was because the anti-Semitism was getting so great there, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yeah, and the house was too big for her as well, I mean what’s she going to do with a 14 room house?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: It also seemed big even if your father was there, because there were only two kids, right?</span> <span id="s548">So it would seem like you --</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yeah, but I mean, but probably there were three or four rooms that belonged to the -- to the practice, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: We had 10 rooms, was a beautiful house.</span> <span id="s552">I still see it in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Beautiful home.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: You had a lot of fun there.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: So you left, and where did you move to?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: We moved to an apartment in Trier, Kochstrasse fia, I think it was.</span> <span id="s559">And my mother enlisted us in a Jewish public school which existed in Trier.</span> <span id="s560">And this was already -- I mean there -- there was some anti-Semitism as -- wi -- within the -- in -- within the school, although it was an all Jewish school.</span> <span id="s561">But of course, anti-Semitism was there, and then when Hitler came into power [indecipherable] it was horrible.</span> <span id="s562">The -- I remember going to school there was always a guy standing in -- in uniform, was selling Der Sturmer, you know, that newspaper --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: -- that anti-Semitic [indecipherable] I remember one Jewish woman, tho -- there was a department store in Trier which was owned by Jewish people, and the -- the wife committed suicide, and he said, “The Jewess has killed herself,” he screamed out, and the thing -- buy Der Sturmer.</span> <span id="s565">And were a lot of unpleasant things going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So -- go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: In fact, when I -- you couldn’t go swimming anywhere, without it question, because Jews were not allowed in the swimming pool together with Aryans, and I remember that I wasn’t -- I wasn’t there long because I was already eight.</span> <span id="s568">When I was 10 years old, my mother and -- put me in a Gymnasium, you know what a Gymnasium is?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: This is school, it’s -- I tried to explain to my wife, it’s a high school and college combined.</span> <span id="s571">In other words, as you progress in years, you get -- you get from this into the -- I mean, it’s a Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s572">And then when you’re 18 years old, you can go to the university and bi -- and this was what it was called the humanistisches, which was needed -- if you wanted to be a doctor, you had to go through humanistisches Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s573">There was also something that was called a riad Gymnasium, which was more for engineering and things like that, professions like that.</span> <span id="s574">So I went there, that was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: The kids didn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s577">The teacher used to come in in the morning and used to raise his hand, heil Hitler, you know, and the kids had to say heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s578">I was the only one standing with n-not saying it.</span> <span id="s579">I was red in the face, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Did they tell you you were not supposed to say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I wouldn’t say it, I mean we were not supposed to say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Jews were not supposed to say heil Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s585">And were you put in a particular part of the room?</span> <span id="s586">Were you put in the back of the room, or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: No, no, I was sitting wi-with all the other students, but th-th-th -- they ignored me, you know, I was like a persona non grata there, and they -- in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Were you the only Jewish boy in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: There were bo -- in -- in this class, yes, but there were maybe two or three more Jewish boys in different classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s591">And there was -- in Trier also it’s a very small Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Well, Trier had already a larger Jewish popula -- Trier, I would say is about a city of -- today, I would say over 200,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: And then I think it wasn’t as large, but there were a lot of -- I remember there were a Jewish dentist there, Jewish lawyer, Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s595">A j -- even Jewish stores were there, you know, there was a lady, a fashion store, very exclusive store, was owned by a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s596">There were two department stores owned by Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So do you think there were a few hundred Jews?</span> <span id="s598">There were clearly more than 15 or 16 --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Yeah, I would say, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: A few hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yeah, I would say it, there were more than -- let’s say at least more than a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s603">So in some way it was a bit more comfortable for you, because the population was bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s605">And we had Jewish friends, you know, because the --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: -- I remember when we used to play outside, the kids used to bother and hit us, me at least.</span> <span id="s608">Not so much my sister, but me.</span> <span id="s609">And so we used to -- used to play in the house most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And was it a big apartment, or a small apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No, it was -- I would say six rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s613">And your mother is not working, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: It’s you -- she’s using the money from the sale of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Sale of the house and ma -- the insurance money my father had left her.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s618">So, there’s no chauffeur any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: There is a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: There’s still a maid.</span> <span id="s623">There’s still a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: One maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: The same one?</span> <span id="s626">From Muhlheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yeah, the one that raised me.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s629">So that is a continuity for you, which is comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s631">She loved us very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Did she?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I could say she practically raised me.</span> <span id="s636">I remember her more ta -- pa -- taking care of me than my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s638">So, if it was uncomfortable in terms of school friends, did you learn a lot in the school, or was that ter --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Well, I took -- are you talking about the Jewish school, or the wa -- that -- the Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Well, I’m a little confused.</span> <span id="s643">You first -- when you came first to Trier, you went to a Jewish school, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: That’s correct, because the Gymnasium wouldn’t take a -- a child under 10, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s646">So you move when you’re nine years old, I guess.</span> <span id="s647">Yes, a little over nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: I was a year in the -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: In the Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So was the Jewish school a good one?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: That was go --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: In fact I would say that the Jewish schools were, in many ways, even better than the non-Jewish schools, the public schools, because Jewish teachers prided themselves, they said, “You have to know more than others in order to come to the fore somewhere, somehow.”</span> <span id="s655">And the curriculum was very strict, and I used to sit on my homework for hours and hours and hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: So you -- did you enjoy school?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: But you worked at it?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s660">The way that the Germans -- th-the -- the Europeans school system follows everything into your head.</span> <span id="s661">Let’s say for instance you wrote about something, made a mistake, had to write it six, seven pages the same word.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: You get tired of that, you know?</span> <span id="s664">And you had to do it nevertheless, you had to show it to the teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Now, are you continuing to go to concerts, is your mother bring you to the concerts, or does that stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yeah, we had more or less, we -- no, I wouldn’t say it stopped exactly, it didn’t go to that ma -- there weren’t that many concerts in -- in Trier, it was a small town, there were plays and things.</span> <span id="s667">But they had some Jewish plays that -- I mean, Jewish people putting it -- plays in certain places, and we used to attend them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s669">So -- so you’re in the Jewish school from ’33 until thir -- for a year, about.</span> <span id="s670">So it is 1934 that you go to the Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: And you’re there for a couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I’m there from ni ’34 - ’35, and I think by the end of ’35, we moved to Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span> <span id="s675">And why -- why do you move?</span> <span id="s676">You move an awful lot in a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yeah, my mother moved, I didn’t move.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: I -- yes, I understand.</span> <span id="s679">Do you know why she moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Well, let me put it to you this way.</span> <span id="s681">The more people around you, and the more Jewish people, the less worry about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s682">Because if -- if there’s a large population, people more or less get lost in the crowd, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I guess this must be one of the reason, I don’t know why she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Because it’s not great, I mean di -- i -- th-this -- the Jewish population is considerably larger in Cologne than in Trier.</span> <span id="s686">There are many thousands of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely so.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: It’s --and it’s a much bigger city.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Because they had two synagogues, I believe.</span> <span id="s690">There was one in [indecipherable] and there was one -- there was a wa -- yeah, I went then to a -- to a Jewish school there, which was called the Jawne.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Jawne?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I hated that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Really, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: I hated that school with a passion, and I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s695">The curriculum concentrated all everything on Hebrew and Hebrew and Hebrew and German, and back to Hebrew, and geography di -- I -- geography I liked, history I liked.</span> <span id="s696">I liked -- but Hebrew, it was never --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Never</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: -- never my forte.</span> <span id="s699">And all the teachers were religious, they all had the skullcaps, you know, and one of them had a beard.</span> <span id="s700">And it was more -- I -- I would say it was almost like a Yeshiva, so to speak, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: So this was not a comfortable place for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: No, it was not a comfortable place for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: So let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s704">When your father dies, you say immediately, or very fast you’re not kosher in the house, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Not too much, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: But some?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: But we were still not on the threshold of eating pork.</span> <span id="s708">That came a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s710">But at 1936 you would have been 13.</span> <span id="s711">Did you have a Bar-Mitzvah in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Oh yeah, and I had a Bar-Mitzvah in Cologne, and do you know who my rabbi was?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: A Dr. Carlebach.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: And this is one of the Carlebachs, you remember the Carlebachs at the village gate, the one with the guitar?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Now, this must have been his grandfather or his uncle, or whoever.</span> <span id="s719">And he was ultra, ultra Orthodox, I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s720">You -- he could sniff if somebody wasn’t o -- Orthodox.</span> <span id="s721">I had to go there because my aunts from my father’s side, they were so religious.</span> <span id="s722">O-On s -- on the s -- Sabbath, they would sew their handkerchief into the clothing, so because they’re not supposed to carry it, you know, all that -- baloney, if I ever heard one.</span> <span id="s723">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: How can you use it if it’s sewn into your clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: I don’t know, don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s726">I was never that religious.</span> <span id="s727">I carry it like I carry it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Like you carry it now, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: And I tell you that later, I don’t want to get that on -- on tape, my grand -- of course, my whole family attended, except I had one uncle who was also a rabbi.</span> <span id="s730">He was what was called a landesrabbiner.</span> <span id="s731">A landesrabbiner is a rabbi not only of one synagogue, but a while district of synagogues.</span> <span id="s732">And he was ultra, ultra, ultra, ultra Orthodox.</span> <span id="s733">My Uncle Heinrich, Heinrich Bassfreund.</span> <span id="s734">He -- he was -- he completely ignored it.</span> <span id="s735">He was almost like you would say the Queen of England, you bring a commoner to be your future wife or some.</span> <span id="s736">You -- you were nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So you were noth --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: He didn’t even attend my Bar-Mitzvah because that was not Jewish enough, my ba -- even if it was in a -- in an Orthodox Temple, but I wasn’t Jewish enough to be [indecipherable] Bar-Mitzvahed, maybe he figured I am actually doing something to the religious atmosphere -- air right in this particular synagogue --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s740">How would he know that --</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: -- by being Bar-Mitzvahed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: H-How would he know that you weren’t very religious, did he know you?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Yeah, of course he knew me.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Oh, he di -- he du --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: He knew -- he must have known that my mother did not come from such a religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: And that was enough for him.</span> <span id="s748">Anyway, he sent me book, a Hebrew book, everything in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s749">And this is all the last I heard of him.</span> <span id="s750">He later went to Israel.</span> <span id="s751">He went to Pethatikyah, which is a very religious area.</span> <span id="s752">I think he o -- he operated a Laundromat there or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: And I never heard it.</span> <span id="s755">I asked him once -- I wanted a picture of my grandfather, he says I don’t need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Not nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: No.</span> <span id="s758">He was not a nice person.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Did you have a party?</span> <span id="s760">I don’t know what -- what was the tradition at that time when they got Bar-Mitzvahed, did you have a party?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah, we had a -- we -- not only did we have a party, that party had to be catered by a kosher caterer because my aunts would not have attended if there wasn’t a ko -- was a weird family set up to be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So you were very divided?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Like a German [indecipherable] is a Communist and the other one is a Nazi.</span> <span id="s764">This is how the atmosphere really was -- was.</span> <span id="s765">I -- she -- they wouldn’t have come.</span> <span id="s766">And my uncle from my mother’s side, they are not religious at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So what did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: He said, if you want to see how religious is, leave 10 dollars on the table and see how fast it is gone on Shabbos.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So did they sit on two opposite sides at the party, or did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, no, my -- my fi -- my mother’s sisters-in-law on my father’s side, they were very nice to my mother.</span> <span id="s771">The other aunt that I had, the one that was a pr-professor on the -- on the [indecipherable] school in Fert, she was -- I would say she was religious, but not that religious, I mean.</span> <span id="s772">I think that her handkerchief was already in the pocket, or the pocketbook, whatever.</span> <span id="s773">But she was re-religious nevertheless.</span> <span id="s774">She knew all about Jewish upbringing because my grandfather was a rabbi in Trier.</span> <span id="s775">And I understand that my grandmother was supposed to have been a good [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s776">Anytime somebody got sick she made them chicken soup, she went to the house, she was flying around from one Jewish family to the other, see if she can help them, and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s778">Now, there was no equivalent ceremony for girls at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: There was -- right.</span> <span id="s781">So your sister had no --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: It -- there is still today, I don’t think, in -- in the Orthodox --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: In the Orthodox, no, absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: -- cir -- cir -- circles a ba -- a Bat-Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: So was this day a big deal for you, or a big problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I don’t know, I -- when I was a kid I had a very good voice, and they all want me to become a Chassan.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: That would have been the last thing on my mind.</span> <span id="s789">I would have liked to be an opera singer maybe, but not a Chassan.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Did you study singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: No.</span> <span id="s792">But I knew of -- I -- I have a very good ear for music, I -- I hear something on the radio and 90 out of a hundred times I can tell you what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s795">If it’s an opera, or a symphony, a concerto, I can -- sometimes Phyllis, Phyllis knows a lot, too.</span> <span id="s796">But sometimes she gets mixed up and she says to me, and I tell her, no, that’s not a Mendelssohn, this is just a -- the [indecipherable] concerto, or this is the [indecipherable] concerto, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: All right, so you get past your Bar-Mitzvah, do you now feel like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: A man?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: -- man?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: No, not like the man at the house, my mother wielded the scepter.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: And I -- I hated that school, believe me.</span> <span id="s805">I think I might have converted to get out of that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: To get out of there.</span> <span id="s807">What kind of a kid were you?</span> <span id="s808">How would you describe yourself?</span> <span id="s809">Were you a -- a very shy young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I wouldn’t exactly say shy, but I used to love to read, and I could busy myself with things like reading, looking up things, looking at maps.</span> <span

school, or did she?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: My sister was in Cologne with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: With your mother, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: My mother got her out of the house too, at several occasions, she has to go to cooking school in Frankfurt, and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s946">Our relationship with our mother wasn’t a great one.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Wasn’t -- no, that’s clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: So how long are you at school in Coburg?</span> <span

<p><span id="s955">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: So is -- is this difficult for you, this ki -- this moving around so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: You’re a kid [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Well -- well, I mean, it’s a different -- for you to keep up with my moving around so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Yes, it’s -- but it’s not -- wasn’t difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s962">Except sometimes chronologically I have the date sometimes not exactly at this particular month or year, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: You know, the reason why I say it is because as a young person, you were -- you were a child --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah, I was a nomad, I was a gypsy.</span> <span id="s965">[indecipherable] the only thing I need was a fiddle and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: -- I could have graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: But you clearly adjusted very well each time.</span> <span id="s969">You were able --</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yeah, I mean, this is the good thing about me, that I adjust.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: How else would I be here today?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: That’s true, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I mean, I wouldn’t say exactly I adjusted myself to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I tolerated it, because I had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s978">Well, you’re going to go to Berlin next, and I think what we’ll do is we’ll stop the tape and change it, because the story will get longer now.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: You moved to Berlin.</span> <span id="s982">You’re -- you’re in the school in Coburg for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: So the f -- your mother moves to Berlin in 1938, or ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: ’37, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: So you’re still in school?</span> <span id="s987">You’re still in that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: No, ’38 it must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: So, before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Why Berlin?</span> <span id="s994">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Berlin was -- still had the most Jews, and Berlin is -- was a large city where there were five million.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: So yo-you think the idea here was if there were more Jews, you would somehow be protected, do you think?</span> <span id="s997">Is that what your mother [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: You had more of a Jewish life there.</span> <span id="s999">First of all, they had what was called the Kulturbund.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: The Kulturbund was an institution for s -- privileged by Dr. Goebbels to perform music and plays, as long as they were not of German compo -- in other words, if you were a -- a German -- a -- a Jewish pianist, you were not allowed to play Beethoven, or Mozart, which was -- in those days I mean, was already -- no, but it wa -- that was before.</span> <span id="s1002">No, I don’t think you could play Mozart as well, because after -- after they annexed Austria, they certainly were not allowed to play Mozart.</span> <span id="s1003">They were allowed to play whoever -- French composers, they were allowed.</span> <span id="s1004">You could play Mendelssohn, who was a Jew himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Could you play Chopin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: A German couldn’t play f -- yeah, Chopin, of course.</span> <span id="s1007">Chopin wa -- was not German, he was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: French -- French Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: So could the German pianists, or performers play Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: -- composers?</span> <span id="s1013">They couldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: That was a no-no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Goebbels said, the time has come to an end of a Jewish overdone culture.</span> <span id="s1017">He says we got our own radio, we got our own plays, we got our own musicians, and we have proven that we don’t need the Jews.</span> <span id="s1018">That’s what he said, almost w-word for word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Why do you leave the school at Coburg and go to Berlin?</span> <span id="s1020">Are you finished, is the school done, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: My mother remarried, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: And -- and he lived in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: She remarried when I was in -- when we were still in Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: So who was this guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: She met her second husband at my cousin’s Bar-Mitzvah who is the one that died in France, my cousin Hans Bodenheimer, and she met a teacher there, a very intelligent man.</span> <span id="s1028">I respected him more than my mother, although he was also a little bit of a strict disciplinarian, but he helped me a lot with my homework.</span> <span id="s1029">He came in handy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1031">Was he a nice guy?</span> <span id="s1032">Was he nice [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yeah, he was a nice man, he was -- he was a little on the crazy side.</span> <span id="s1034">He would walk around with Bavarian leather pants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1037">Was a little bit of a nut type.</span> <span id="s1038">He was a -- but he was an hi -- highly intelligent man.</span> <span id="s1039">He spoke French, he spoke English, he spoke German.</span> <span id="s1040">He was good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s1041">He was a teacher, you know?</span> <span id="s1042">But there was a public coo -- school teacher, but he taught the higher grades, he was a very intelligent man.</span> <span id="s1043">And he knew Hebrew well, too, but he was not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1046">I don’t think a religious Jew would be seen in leather -- Bavarian leather pants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So was he approximately a ma -- ye -- was your mother close in age to your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: No, my mother -- he was younger than my mother.</span> <span id="s1049">He was maybe six, seven years younger than my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1051">And was your mother approximately the same age as your biological father, Manfred?</span> <span id="s1052">A: My -- let me see.</span> <span id="s1053">She was four years younger than my biological father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Uh-huh, so she was in her late 30’s when your father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: And so it’s a few years later, so she’s in her early 40’s when she met [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: I guess she got tired of the singles scene, what more can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: I guess.</span> <span id="s1061">But did she introduce you kids?</span> <span id="s1062">Did you kno -- did you know him before she got married, or w --</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Yeah, I knew him.</span> <span id="s1064">When I came on vacation from Coburg, I was introduced to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1066">And -- and he was nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yeah, he was nice.</span> <span id="s1068">He sometimes was a little bit of a disciplinarian, but there was nothing wrong with him, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1070">So when you moved to Berlin, did he then have a job as a teacher in a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Yeah, in a Jewish school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: He taught in Berlin at first, and then he taught in a school in Halle, H-a-l-l-e, on -- at the Salle river.</span> <span id="s1074">I don’t -- I don’t know exactly how far it is from Berlin, I would say about an hour and a half, two hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: And he had a car, and I just see him on weekends, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: So did he live at the school, or he came back every day?</span> <span id="s1078">Or you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Now he had the room in town, a furnished room that he stayed in during the week, and then on weekends he would come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Uh-huh, okay, so what brought you back from Coburg to go to Berlin, were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: But you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: It was my mother’s decision I guess, I was not able to make my own decision, especially in Europe, a kid doesn’t make his own decisions until he’s maybe 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So if you came back in 1938, you’re 15, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: You were 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Your sister is 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: And she’s been living with your mother sort of on and off, but more on than off, right?</span> <span id="s1093">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Yeah, but -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: -- where do you live in Berlin?</span> <span id="s1096">In Charlottenberg?</span> <span id="s1097">A: In an apartment in Charlottenberg, at the Sybelstrasse.</span> <span id="s1098">I don’t remember if it was five or six.</span> <span id="s1099">I lived in both, the thing was this, that after -- well, what happened was that when Kristallnacht happened, my stepfather was in the United States on a -- on a trip to see whether he could arrange that we would come over there.</span> <span id="s1100">And my mother sent him a telegram, she says, “Don’t come back.”</span> <span id="s1101">Because of pe-people got arrested there -- left and right there during that time.</span> <span id="s1102">And he stayed there.</span> <span id="s1103">He couldn’t stay here, he went to San Domingo.</span> <span id="s1104">San Domingo was ruled at that time by a dictator by the name of -- do you remember?</span> <span

Well, I don’t know hi -- di -- bip -- he -- he -- he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1117">He couldn’t even himself stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: So then when times really got bad, and my f -- my mother divorced him, and she married for the third time, and she married a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1120">That was Dr. Rehfeld.</span> <span

The Jewish trade school was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Was later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: -- before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Yes, I know.</span> <span

Jewish trade school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1150">And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Was called ORT, I think, O-R-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s1153">From the ORT organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: And why is that the decision, because people thought --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Because people thought that if they go out of the country, would have [indecipherable] would be good to have a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: I took up woodworking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1160">A: I used to do nice things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1163">And that was in 19 -- I would say that would have been 1937 maybe.</span> <span id="s1164">But that -- no, 1938.</span> <span id="s1165">Beginning of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Yes, before -- before Kristallnacht, eight or nine months [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: And you -- had you been doing woodworking as a kid?</span> <span id="s1169">I mean, you were whittling things, and that’s why you went to woodworking, or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: No, I had a choice between metalworking and woodworking, I took woodworking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: And what was -- what would that mean, what would you do?</span> <span id="s1172">What kind of woodworking would you learn to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Well, I used to do ga -- pa -- clothes closets, and dressers and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Oh, so big pieces?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: I liked it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: I had, in fact, one of our superintendents in -- in Berlin still has a -- I mean, they are not alive, probably the daughter has, a clothes closet I made for her -- for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: So it really lasted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Now Berlin is becoming not so easy to live in as a Jew, even though there’s a larger Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: I know.</span> <span id="s1186">And now that the war’s started, we have to work for the war industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Well, wait a second.</span> <span id="s1188">Were you there for Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: What do you remember about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: On Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: I remember the next morning not knowing about it, and I came outside, and I just came to the corner and a German started, or tried to beat me up.</span> <span id="s1194">And I ran home again.</span> <span id="s1195">That’s all I remember of Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: So you don’t remember see -- did you see the damage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: No, you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1200">I saw a few stores, and -- at the Wilmersdorferstrasse, I saw glass and things, but I -- I really didn’t see the active --</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: -- destruction of the synagogues, or the -- or the -- the stores themselves.</span> <span id="s1203">I saw the aftermath.</span> <span id="s1204">I mean, when I went by subway to -- to work, I only saw the burned out -- the big synagogue burned out for [indecipherable] see, there’s an EL there, going past there.</span> <span id="s1205">Berlin has EL, subway, bus and streetcar.</span> <span id="s1206">Used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Between ni -- between 1933 and ’38, you’re between the ages of 10 and 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1210">Do you hear about concentration camps?</span> <span id="s1211">Do you know about people being arrested --</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: -- and taken to concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Let me put it to you this way.</span> <span id="s1215">People knew already about concentration camps before that -- the annihilation camps were done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: I mean, everything -- people used to say, don’t talk about it, otherwise you are going to go to Dachau, or -- or something like that.</span> <span id="s1218">I remember distinctly in Cologne there was a Jewish butcher, he had a very unique butcher store, everything was done on a band.</span> <span id="s1219">Like, you [indecipherable] in this department, he would wrap it up and it goes to the next department, and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1220">His name was -- there were two names there, maybe he had a partner, or maybe that was his name.</span> <span id="s1221">His name was Katz Rosenthal.</span> <span id="s1222">And we were -- we would buy the -- our meat there, and all this.</span> <span id="s1223">And I remember there was a young kid that used to sell Der Sturmer, he would stand in front of and photograph the people.</span> <span id="s1224">It was all done by the party, you know?</span> <span id="s1225">Photograph the people going in that store to make sure that no German would buy in that store.</span> <span id="s1226">And this guy lost his business because he had a extremely busy store, and he had good merchandise, good meats, and everything.</span> <span id="s1227">I think that he was actually a Dutch Jew.</span> <span id="s1228">I’m not sure what makes me say that, but I remember that people used to say Katz Rosenthal came from Holland.</span> <span id="s1229">And I remember there was one woman, she came out, she said to him, I want you to know something, you took my picture, you wasted the film, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1230">He called her a dirty Jew bastard, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: So w -- you must hear about people leaving Germany, right?</span> <span id="s1232">People who are -- are leaving -- do you -- do you as -- even as a young person, say to your mother</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Yeah, of course I saw people leaving, but it was not easy to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: It was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: I mean, some people tried to go across the Swiss border, they were always sent back again.</span> <span id="s1238">And they ended up the Gestapo catching them, going into concentration camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: -- of being killed there already.</span> <span id="s1241">And at first the concentration camps were not an exclusive Jewish institution, you know.</span> <span id="s1242">They used to take Communists, anybody that didn’t like the regime, or had different ideas, and opinions.</span> <span id="s1243">You loo -- used to belong to a trade union that was maybe a little bit on the left side, they all of a sudden disappeared mysteriously.</span> <span id="s1244">One guy disappeared, and he se -- he got it to -- his wife -- his widow got a letter, he died of appendicitis, and he had the appendix removed from before he got in already.</span> <span id="s1245">I mean they were not too thorough either sometimes, they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: -- actually really stupid people.</span> <span id="s1248">Dumb people.</span> <span id="s1249">The only thing they were smart in, killing.</span> <span id="s1250">This they had worked out to perfection.</span> <span id="s1251">But otherwise, if one can -- I mean, even when I was in concentration camp, the roll call there, to count up 150 men, sometimes they take two hours because they were so wicked in arithmetic, they never came out [indecipherable] didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Do you remember all the restrictions that came in each of these cities, the restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Oh yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: You can’t ride on the subway, you can’t walk through the park, you can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: So what -- what is it you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: It started of course with the Nuremberg Laws at first, you know, no Jew was allowed to have an Aryan girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1258">And no Jew was allowed to le -- to practice law, and no Jew was allowed to treat non-Jewish patients.</span> <span id="s1259">And then came already -- some cities had already prohibited Jews to go to motion picture houses.</span> <span id="s1260">Like Magdeburg was one of them.</span> <span id="s1261">They had -- they had signs made up like le -- little metal shields at the door, what said Jews not allowed.</span> <span id="s1262">Restaurants wouldn’t allow Jews, many of them.</span> <span id="s1263">I was once in a restaurant in Cologne with my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s1264">Well, I look very Jewish, my sister didn’t look [indecipherable] and neither did my mother really, but they saw right away that we were Jewish because they saw me.</span> <span id="s1265">And the waitress came -- first we wait about 15 or 20 minutes, then the waitress finally come over and said, “And we are not allowed to wait on Jews, would you please leave?”</span> <span id="s1266">So we left, you know?</span> <span id="s1267">I mean, you go to a restaurant to eat, not to sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: And then, in 1936 it eased a little bit due to the Olympic games, you know, there were many foreigners there, and now all of a sudden there were no outrage in the street, or something like that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1270">But as soon as the Olympic games were over, everything went back to normal, and in fact it got worse.</span> <span id="s1271">That was in ’36, the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s1272">In ’37, well, in ’37 of course you couldn’t go swimming, course I mentioned that already.</span> <span id="s1273">You were not allowed to go to the movies any more.</span> <span id="s1274">And you could [indecipherable] to show movies, and there were concerts by the Kulturbund.</span> <span id="s1275">I had a friend who was an actor at the Kulturbund, Fellow from Austria, by the name of Fritz Grunne, he -- he didn’t look like a Jew at all, I mean I ba -- I wouldn’t have believed it.</span> <span id="s1276">And he was not religious at all.</span> <span id="s1277">I remember he used to have a bicycle, he used to ride around Berlin.</span> <span id="s1278">His wife objected to that, because you’re an actor, you ride to work in a -- on a bicycle, I mean how could you?</span> <span id="s1279">But he was a hell of a nice guy.</span> <span id="s1280">I think that he -- he did hang himself in -- in Grunewald on a rope that they found him dangling.</span> <span id="s1281">He was a young man, he was maybe 25 - 26.</span> <span id="s1282">He killed -- in fact of, if -- the unusual part is he told me he was called to Neubabelsberg.</span> <span id="s1283">Neubabelsberg was in Berlin, the UFA studios.</span> <span id="s1284">The UFA of course at one time, was owned by a man by the name of deesel -- du -- Deusterberg.</span> <span id="s1285">He was the head of the Stahlhelm, Stahlhelm.</span> <span id="s1286">It was also a para-Nazi organization.</span> <span id="s1287">Then of course Goebbels took over the -- the -- the film industry, and they made a picture, was called, “The Eternal Jew.”</span> <span id="s1288">And he had to go -- he told me he had to go and dance with a woman, and he was photographed while he was dancing.</span> <span id="s1289">That was what they told him, then he had to go there.</span> <span id="s1290">It was an anti-Semitic picture now, I think what -- I think -- I believe it was Veit Harland who made that picture, he made also “Jud Suss”, and -- and all these other anti-Semitic motion pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Do you remember what you were thinking at the time?</span> <span id="s1292">Did you think at some point this will stop, and it’ll -- you’ll just have this Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: I didn’t think it would stop, but nobody would have thought it would end like that, you know.</span> <span id="s1296">I mean, we thought -- first of all, it was a way of dis -- deceiving people.</span> <span id="s1297">People all of a sudden had to leave, they were resettled.</span> <span id="s1298">They were evacuated.</span> <span id="s1299">They had working permits to work and live free in Riga in Poland, you know, and after the war ver -- after the war started, and nobody knew what happened, these people just disappeared.</span> <span id="s1300">Nobody never heard of -- I mean, never heard because we didn’t bother, but we never heard of many -- during the war you didn’t hear of people anyway, because foreign countries, you know, they were occupied countries.</span> <span id="s1301">You wouldn’t dare to write to a country like that to find out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: What happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: -- you know, they would have thought you’re a spy.</span> <span id="s1304">In fact, before I left to a concentration, we all had to sign the paper that we had to leave Germany on account of s -- espionage activity or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Is this right before you were sent, or earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Before I was sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Wa -- before you were sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Now, you’re in school, in this trade school for about two years, am I right?</span> <span id="s1310">Before you’re sent to forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Yeah, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Forced labor comes in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No, forced labor come in ’40, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Maybe it’s ’41, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: No, you’re right, it starts in ’40, but you are not brought into forced labor until 1941, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1318">I worked in a -- in Berlin in a leather factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: After the woodworking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: You did the woodworking, and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Then I wa -- we had to go to the -- to the labor department and they assigned you a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: And it’s labor department of the Germans, or the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: No, the labor department of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: And you had to go there, you know, and you had no choice, I mean, you couldn’t say you don’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: So you’re working in a -- huh.</span> <span id="s1328">So you’re -- so you’re working in a leather factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: And doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: I was sewing German knapsacks and things, but I was quite good at it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: So you’re very good with your hands?</span> <span id="s1333">A: With two needles -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: And who is working there, Jews, and Gentiles?</span> <span id="s1335">Everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Oh -- Gentiles too, but a Jewish -- the Jewish department was separated from the Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: The only person Gentile there was the supervisor who saw that we were get to work.</span> <span id="s1339">The -- the non-Jewish department was in a different room, you know, a different room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Now, this is before the war starts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: That was during the war already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: That was during the war.</span> <span id="s1343">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Because the war started in Europe in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: ’39, right.</span> <span id="s1346">So are you taken out of school in order to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: -- to be sent to this leather factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1352">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: [sneezes] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Gesundheit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: And the conditions there were not too bad.</span> <span id="s1357">I mean, they were -- the supervisor I had was -- the first one I had was pretty decent.</span> <span id="s1358">And then he was drafted into the na -- in the German navy.</span> <span id="s1359">A marine or whatever they call it.</span> <span id="s1360">And then we had a Nazi supervisor and he was all right, he just said to be careful what you said, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: But he didn’t bother with us, he -- as long as you did the work he didn’t bother you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: And were you paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Yeah, half of what the Germans got paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Half of what the Germans got paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: But you -- but you did get something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: And you’re living with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1371">Now our -- our apartment has shrunk to one room -- two rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Two rooms, from six.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: And there are other people living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: And people you know, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: No, you don’t.</span> <span id="s1378">Well, one who was living there was the actor from the Kulturbund I told you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: And the original owner of the apartment, which wasn’t my mother any more, we moved from number five to number six, or from number six to five, I don’t remember exactly which was the one that they mo -- lived in first, and which was the last one.</span> <span id="s1381">But it was either five or six, the -- they were both, five and six we lived in.</span> <span id="s1382">And that was already during the war.</span> <span id="s1383">And my mother has worked in the same leather factory that I worked in, which was good.</span> <span id="s1384">So we used to go to work together.</span> <span id="s1385">In those days you could not -- you were only allowed to use transportation to go to work and back, for a Jewish person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: But not for pleasure, you couldn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s1388">Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: And was there a special car for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: No, special car they didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1391">You weren’t allowed to sit down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: You weren’t allowed to sit down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: But -- no, you weren’t allowed to sit.</span> <span id="s1394">Even if the train was completely empty, you couldn’t sit down.</span> <span id="s1395">You had to hold onto the strap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Now is this the first time your mother is working, that you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Was this difficult for her, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1402">She was a very good worker, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Did that surprise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1406">It surprises me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Not -- nothing my mother did surprised me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1409">But it had to be an adjustment of some kind, a woman who had not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Well, I might only say then, she adjusted extremely well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: -- to the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1414">Your sister got to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: How did your mother arrange that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: My mother wrote away to a children’s hospital in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which is near the Scottish border out there somewheres.</span> <span id="s1418">And they sent her papers to come over.</span> <span id="s1419">In fact, my sister came over and she was -- almost when the bridges were burning already.</span> <span id="s1420">It was in July of 1939.</span> <span id="s1421">The war started in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: The trains were so crowded with Wehrmacht, that they lifted my sister through the windows, she couldn’t have gone in through the doors in the train.</span> <span id="s1424">That’s how crowded the [indecipherable] trains were.</span> <span id="s1425">And she went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Was she trained to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: She was not trained at all</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: -- she was working as sh -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: She was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: And why would they be willing to take her, do you think?</span> <span id="s1431">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: She was a -- they took -- amazing at it might sound, the British took in more Jews than the -- the United States did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: And it’s a much smaller country, you know.</span> <span id="s1435">The British took in quite a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: So what about you?</span> <span id="s1437">How come --</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: I was -- I was on the cusp.</span> <span id="s1439">I was too young, and I w -- and in other words not old enough, they wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1440">The Germans took me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Yeah, I understand.</span> <span id="s1442">But there was something called the kindertransport, where they were sending children to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1444">I was -- I was too old for the kindertransport --</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: And too young for this other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: And too young for wor -- I couldn’t have been a nurse, you know, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1447">But I was too young for the kindertransport -- too old for the kindertransport, rather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1449">So was this difficult for you to separate from your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Yeah, I missed her.</span> <span id="s1451">I missed her, beca -- my sister and I, we were very close.</span> <span id="s1452">When my sister used to go on a date, I used to hide it from my mother.</span> <span id="s1453">I used to tell her I went to the movies with her, or something.</span> <span id="s1454">Or my sister gave me money to go to the movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: And I -- sure, I missed my sister a lot.</span> <span id="s1457">I still call her today, every week --</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: -- we call -- we call and speak to each other.</span> <span id="s1460">And my -- what did I want to say now?</span> <span id="s1461">My mother had sent her away, and my mother also was negotiating to go to an English doctor as a maid, for ch -- in this family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: But it never came to pass.</span> <span id="s1464">I also was close to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1465">There was somebody from a Jewish organization who sent me papers, but there was -- you know, since everybody tried to go out there was a long waiting list of people to get visas.</span> <span id="s1466">By the time my visa came up, there was war already.</span> <span id="s1467">The United States had entered the war, so there was chance for me to get out any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1469">But your mother clearly was trying, and had some ingenuity in getting your sister out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Finding that particular place, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: So that was pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1475">Well, you have to -- you have to do sometime something good, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Sometime, right.</span> <span id="s1477">Okay, we’re going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Jack, did you ever get depressed during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Now, or you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: No, not now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: During that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: You were in a constant state of depression so to speak, I mean how would you feel if you can’t go to movies, you can’t go out after eight o’clock at night in the summer, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1486">Of course you feel depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1489">Everybody was scared, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: It’s only normal, I mean you didn’t know in the street when you were -- somebody would pick you up, or somebody knock on the door, you didn’t know whether it was the Gestapo, or SS, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Did you sleep okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s1495">Did you have nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1498">So it affected your waking hours, but it doesn’t affect your sleeping?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Yeah, no I -- I didn’t dwell on it so it would affect me at night really.</span> <span id="s1500">I mean, you were on constant guard, so to speak, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Do you -- do you think the adults around you were more nervous than the kids?</span> <span id="s1502">Did you notice that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Well, it depends upon the type of person, you know, some people they’re always nervous, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: And some people were, of course.</span> <span id="s1506">Some people were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: You were taken for forced labor --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: -- in 1941, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: And is that when you were taken to -- you were taken to a factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: And which factory was the first one?</span> <span id="s1514">It wasn’t the leather, it was -- were you working on shelves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: I was -- in the leather factory was the first one, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: The leather factory was the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Klopfer was the name, K-l-o-p-f-e-r.</span> <span id="s1520">And they were -- they did work for the -- for the government, you know, with -- for the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: And so how long are you working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: This is what, ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: I would say a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: You worked there for a year.</span> <span id="s1526">And you are now wearing a Jewish star, am I correct?</span> <span id="s1527">When you’re there, or at some point in that year 1941, they ask -- they tell you you have to wear a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: I had to wear what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Jewish star.</span> <span id="s1530">The star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Oh, that was -- the Jewish star came out in 19 -- I would say maybe it was long before then, no?</span> <span id="s1532">1940, maybe.</span> <span id="s1533">40 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: So it was ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Maybe so.</span> <span id="s1538">I remember I was wearing it, but I don’t remember exactly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Did you have to wear it on your coat, clearly, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yeah, you had to wear it on the outer garment under the heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: One the left side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1544">And when you were in the factory, did you have to have it on with your normal clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1546">I think you took your coats off.</span> <span id="s1547">Yeah, maybe you did have to have -- you go ha -- you had several of them, you know, and you had to sew it on.</span> <span id="s1548">I don’t remember that exactly, but I had it in the factory, and I -- I would think maybe yes.</span> <span id="s1549">Now that I think about it, I think that the people are wearing it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Okay, right.</span> <span id="s1551">Can you see the factory in your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: What did it look like?</span> <span id="s1554">What did it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Was a long row of benches with men and women, Jewish men and women working.</span> <span id="s1556">They had in front of them a t -- a wooden contraption that was like two pieces of wood that came like a -- at the end like a claw.</span> <span id="s1557">And that’s where you put the leather in.</span> <span id="s1558">And on the bottom, there was like a pattern, this wasn’t a pattern, this was a piece of wood that was connected to this with a leather strap, so when you put your leg -- your foot on it, it would close this up, and it would hold the leather when you went sewing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1560">And so what were you actually sewing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: It’s a good question, I was sewing a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1562">I was sewing what was called geschossbander, which was -- which means -- I think that’s what they wrapped the grenades in.</span> <span id="s1563">It was a green piece of some kind of material, and on each end you had to sew in a piece of string.</span> <span id="s1564">I would s -- ma-maybe even say more a piece of rope, so it’s came to a U on each end, you know.</span> <span id="s1565">I don’t know what it was for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: So it was -- it would hold s -- th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: A gescho -- it was called geschossbander.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Shooting bands, or bands for ammunition, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: So how were you trained to do this?</span> <span id="s1571">I mean, did they train you all when you were sent to the factory, or they just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: No, you b -- you looked up at your -- what you did how the others did it.</span> <span id="s1573">And in fact, I was so good at it sometimes I had to make the samples for the Wehrmacht --</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: -- to inspect because they had inspections there.</span> <span id="s1576">I had to make the -- the samples, you know, because you had to stitch it.</span> <span id="s1577">Now, when you stitch leather, it comes out like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: And I was very good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: When you stitch it with a machine, you mean, it comes out like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: No, not with -- by hand, by hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: By hand?</span> <span id="s1583">Oh, everything was by hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Everything was by hand.</span> <span id="s1585">The mir -- there were ce -- certain things done over there by machine, but not -- what I was doing was not -- was all done by hand, and what the people were doing where I was working was all hand work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: So, in 1940 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: You had an awl --</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: And you would piece the tru -- you know, the -- drill the hole through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Then you would put the needles in, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: And pull.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: So you were 18?</span> <span id="s1595">1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Oh gee, I was older than I thought I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Right, 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: You were 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Were there other people as young as you?</span> <span id="s1602">Were there 18 year olds and younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yeah, my friend Martin that I looked up yesterday on the lists in the things, he was there, my friend Martin Braun.</span> <span id="s1604">We were very good friends, very good friend, very witty fellow.</span> <span id="s1605">You would have liked to have him --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: -- interview him.</span> <span id="s1608">He was really something, this guy.</span> <span id="s1609">Funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: And you made him as a friend in Berlin, is that where you met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1612">And then we found out that we lived almost the ca -- ba -- around the corner from each other.</span> <span id="s1613">It’s a -- at this time we had already exclusively Jewish friends, I mean Christian people didn’t bother with you no more.</span> <span id="s1614">I mean, you would meet -- like I had to go to -- let’s say to the superintendent [indecipherable] and he -- I talked to him or so, but nothing -- nothing political over there right now, so you had to be very careful, very cautious about that.</span> <span id="s1615">And -- but I would say 99.9 percent of your friends were all Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: And did you know Germans who were kind, who were hating the Nazis [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: It a -- ap -- well, un-unfortunately not too many, but I should not say that they were all that bad.</span> <span id="s1618">The last job that I had, I -- I finally ended up -- well, I had two more jobs, they were -- were -- chronologically, I don’t know how you fit that in from wa -- ’42 to ’43, but I worked in -- also in a factory that made airplane paint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Airplane paint?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Yeah, in Weisensee in Berlin, suburb of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1621">It was -- that place was -- I mean, the work was hard, but I was able to do it, I was young.</span> <span id="s1622">I did nothing all day but l-load up p-pa semis, you know, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: With the paint?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: -- paint barrels, yeah.</span> <span id="s1625">And the supervisor was a real Nazi, him in uniform, and he -- when my girlfriend picked me up once there, he told me he doesn’t want to see no Jewish people in that area, and if you -- next time he sees her, he’s going to report her to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1626">He was a real weirdo, this guy, he didn’t even -- he had a Polish name, and we -- but he was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Is this -- this is a different girlfriend than the one we talked about before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Yeah, of course, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: I mean, there were many, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yeah, there were many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Were any of them serious, was this a serious girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Yeah, the last one, Ellen was serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1636">And is that the one that you were talking about here in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Yeah, that’s the one I’m talking about in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1639">El -- her name is Ellen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: It was Ellen Wolf, she -- also she died right in Auschwitz there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: And I have a picture of her too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Yes, we’ll see it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: And -- wh-while I was working there, I wa -- I had an -- an inflamed appendix, and I had to go to the hospital, and a -- a German hospital was not allowed to -- to take you in.</span> <span id="s1645">The only thing a German hospital was allowed, let’s say, if I were to cut my hand off or something, they would allow t-to put a bandage on, but you could not go to a German hospital.</span> <span id="s1646">In those days the only vehicle I was allowed to take to work was the streetcar.</span> <span id="s1647">And I’ll tell you what that is if you have an acute appendicitis and you have to take the streetcar from one end of Berlin to the other.</span> <span id="s1648">Every time that st -- car started to rattle, I could -- I felt that my insides were falling out.</span> <span id="s1649">But I made it to the Jewish hospital which existed all during the war, that’s wa -- the hospital was located at the Iranischestrasse.</span> <span id="s1650">Iranian Street, Iranish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Iranischestrasse, and while I was there, they operated.</span> <span id="s1653">Dr. Knopf did my operation, I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s1654">They had also a cute -- a cute little girl there, she was a nurse by the name of Ruth.</span> <span id="s1655">I liked her.</span> <span id="s1656">But I was there about two days, all of a sudden, that -- the police came up and took the bedsheets home [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1657">They needed them for the Germans, not for us, so we had to lie on the mattress.</span> <span id="s1658">But it wasn’t that bad, you know.</span> <span id="s1659">And I was lucky it happened to me, because in Auschwitz it would have been a horrible operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: If they would have operated to begin with, you know?</span> <span id="s1662">Some people were operated, but they didn’t -- did -- they -- f -- you could f -- they had no anesthesia there that was really effective, because they saved that -- we were considered like vermin, we were nothing, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: So some people said they felt the knife go in and everything, and they were in such pain.</span> <span id="s1665">But I was lucky it happened just prior to my perv -- going into Auschwitz, you know, going to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s1667">And how long were you in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: I would say about four -- four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: That’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: And then you went back to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: I was very comfortable there, because my girlfriend lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: She lived there, how come?</span> <span id="s1674">She worked there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Well, because next to the hospital there was a home for girls that had no parents.</span> <span id="s1676">I mean, she had parents, don’t misunderstand, but the parents were divorced.</span> <span id="s1677">The mother had a boyfriend, and they went to Shanghai and left the kid there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Left they kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1680">And -- and Ellen took that very serious, she always says, “My mother left me here to die.”</span> <span id="s1681">Because they knew more about it than we did, there were so many Jewish people there, and there was the hospital, and they had more connection to what was going on in the outs -- in fact, I had a friend, and his mother was a maid, and she had the cleaning woman at the Swiss consulate, that’s the job they gave her.</span> <span id="s1682">And she saw the Swiss ca -- newspapers were in German, you know?</span> <span id="s1683">Switzerland has three different languages.</span> <span id="s1684">It’s -- the [indecipherable] Italian Swiss, near Tyrol, and there’s the German Swiss, which is the -- and then there’s the French Swiss, you know?</span> <span id="s1685">But the ger -- the -- the papers -- the papers from Geneva, they were only in -- in -- in German -- genf -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1686">And she -- he said to me, “You know something?”</span> <span id="s1687">He says, “I’ve a -- my mother read in the paper that -- you know where the Jews are going?</span> <span id="s1688">They’re going to Auschwitz and get gassed.”</span> <span id="s1689">We laughed.</span> <span id="s1690">We didn’t believe it, I mean that sounded, you know, it’s -- it’s would be the same thing if you had said to me now, if I come out -- if he -- out of here, I get arrested.</span> <span id="s1691">I just -- I didn’t fathom it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: But Ellen said this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: No, this -- this guy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: This other person --</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: -- that worked with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1697">And so there was no -- there was no conception on your part that -- that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: No, there was no -- well, I -- I knew that people disappeared, but we didn’t think that they going the gas chamber, they said we -- they resettled, they have to work there, they have to do road work, have to do this, but they are treated nice, you know.</span> <span id="s1699">I mean nice -- they were treated they got enough to eat and all those -- that’s what they told you.</span> <span id="s1700">And that’s why so many Jewish people went there, they said we got resettled, I mean, after all, you’re waiting so long, and we always afraid, and now the time has come, now we are going, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: But what did you think when Ellen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: It didn’t know what was on the -- at the other end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1704">But Ellen said, I -- obviously before deportation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: -- that my mother left here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Left me here to die, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: -- here to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: I don’t know why she said it.</span> <span id="s1710">She must have heard -- because since she was -- in other words, the to -- here was the Jewish hospital, next to there there was an annex where they had an old age home, and there was another ann -- another annex for children that had no parents, you know, and she had no parents, because the father was divorced, he couldn’t take care of her, and wa -- di -- ch -- and the mother went away with her boyfriend to Shanghai and left her there.</span> <span id="s1711">And she always used to say to me, “I hate my mother, she left me here to die.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: And she was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: She was right, she -- she was left to die.</span> <span id="s1716">And she did die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: When y -- when you were working in the leather factory, was your mother there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: But when you went to the airplane factory she wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: She’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: But I’m -- Ellen was also in that factory there, with the bi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: In the leather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Leather factory, yeah, that’s where I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1726">But she also didn’t go with you to the f -- to the airplane factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1728">You couldn’t just go, you had to be assigned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: I mean it was -- it was like winning the lottery.</span> <span id="s1731">You could go maybe to carry cement, without knowing, or you could go to a job where you had to -- pub -- sort Band-aids, it was -- all depended what they had need for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: And some people went to go to the potato harvest, they were shipped to 50 - 60 miles out of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: And so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: So all of you were as if you were pegs in a -- I don’t know, in a plot.</span> <span id="s1737">It didn’t matter, you were -- who you were with, or whether you were with your mother, or your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: No, they have wa -- n -- no bearing on the thing whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: You were just -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: It was just where they assigned you to.</span> <span id="s1741">So I was assigned to the -- and, as I said when I was in [indecipherable], I came out of the hospital -- that’s what I wanted to bring out -- I came out of the hospital, and of course I walked a little slower than usual, and the boss saw me, and he fired me.</span> <span id="s1742">And I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: That other guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1745">And I was lucky, the railroad needed people.</span> <span id="s1746">S -- Unharda barnholf was one of the big railway stations there, and also passenger station, the railway stations being separate from the passenger stations.</span> <span id="s1747">In other words, this might be the railroad station, this is the passenger -- the -- the -- where they unload the -- the wa -- the trains, freight trains.</span> <span id="s1748">And I worked for a guy -- a man there, he was called -- he was what is called an umpman, he was in charge of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1749">And he liked Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1750">I mean, he was always nicer.</span> <span id="s1751">And I remember one day just before Christmas he told me -- he says to me, “Jack,” -- Jurgen, whatever, “come to my office, I have a piece of furniture to move.”</span> <span id="s1752">And I went in.</span> <span id="s1753">He says, “I move -- I called you away, you don’t get anything to eat.”</span> <span id="s1754">He gave me a piece of cake and a sandwich.</span> <span id="s1755">He says, “I haven’t got much to give for Christmas because we don’t get anything.”</span> <span id="s1756">But he said, “What they do to you is awful.”</span> <span id="s1757">And he gave me the sandwich, and he gave me the piece of cake.</span> <span id="s1758">Unfortunately later he got killed by a bomb that hit the station when he was on duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: So there were small, little things that some people did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Smaller.</span> <span id="s1761">There were also smaller things that sometimes would find somebody when they were on the subways, say somebody would run for the train and push some food stamps in your hand, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Just a stranger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Yeah, you never knew who it was, you know?</span> <span id="s1764">But it was very rare, very, very rare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: But i-isn’t it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: It took courage in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: It did took courage, that much I have to say, because you could never tell who was watching you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: I was once riding in a si -- in a train, and I -- in an elevated train, and they always had signs there in German, Vorsicht Belgesprachen Feind Hort Mit, which means b-beware of speaking openly because enemy is listening in, and somebody scraped out the word enemy and wrote Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1771">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1772">You know?</span> <span id="s1773">I mean, it took courage for people to do that, because you could never tell, that there were eyes and ears all over the place, and you didn’t even know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Wasn’t there a time when the ration cards -- th-the ration stamps were all the same, and then at a certain point they would put a ji -- they put a J on the ration stamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: So that you couldn’t get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: The sa -- ration stamps were -- had all printed so a red letter J on every stamp.</span> <span id="s1778">And when [indecipherable] the stamps, yeah.</span> <span id="s1779">And of course, I remember once -- I had a very lucky break once, when they gave out for Christmas, people were allowed to have coffee, got some kind of a ration of coffee.</span> <span id="s1780">My mother gave in, too.</span> <span id="s1781">Well, somebody came out, Jews cannot have it.</span> <span id="s1782">We get a letter from the police department.</span> <span id="s1783">Mrs. Rehfeld, or what -- well -- yeah, Mrs. -- well, I don’t know whether she was Rehfeld yet, or Schindler.</span> <span id="s1784">Who could keep up with her?</span> <span id="s1785">And -- has to ap-appear at eight o’clock at night at the police station.</span> <span id="s1786">So I went with my mother.</span> <span id="s1787">The police officer -- it was a station that no Jew wanted to go to.</span> <span id="s1788">It was in the Krollmanstrasse, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1789">They were non -- if you stand there waiting, a police would come and push you, and you would fall, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1790">Well, there was this guy sitting there, and he said, “You -- you have a letter,” he says, “where are you from?”</span> <span id="s1791">My mother says she is -- that she is from Saarbrucken.</span> <span id="s1792">He says, “I’m from Saarbrucken, too,” he says, “what cr-crime did you commit?”</span> <span id="s1793">She said, “I gave the stamp in.”</span> <span id="s1794">He said, “Screw them.”</span> <span id="s1795">He s -- tore it up and threw it in the wastebasket, said, “Go home.”</span> <span id="s1796">Was a lucky break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: She could have gone to camp for that.</span> <span id="s1799">She would have had one of these Nazis there, that real wild ones.</span> <span id="s1800">There were a few decent people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: I’m not saying that all of Germany was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: But I would say 95 percent of them were bad, I mean that you can, in -- in France, or in other countries also, the French were not too good to the Jews either, but there were always people that would hide them, that would do this, would -- would do that for them.</span> <span id="s1805">Or at least children, they would take children in to hide them, or -- not in Germany, you didn’t find that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: But did you -- did you know that in Berlin there were Jews who were hiding underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Yeah, of course we knew.</span> <span id="s1808">We didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s1809">But there were Jews hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Di-Did you think about that as a possibility, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: No, I had nobody to hide me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: You didn’t know anyone to do it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: But certainly starting in 1941 when they -- when they took you in forced labor, the deportations out of Berlin start.</span> <span id="s1817">So did you know about deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Deportations started in ’41, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Yeah, I saw, for instance, people who had worked with me at that leather factory already, they went to Riga, they went to what was at that time, and the Germans occupied it, was called Litzmannstadt, which is Lodz today, you know.</span> <span id="s1821">Or it used to be Lodz, anyway.</span> <span id="s1822">Was called litz -- Litzmannstadt, and these people ju -- just disappeared, you didn’t hear from them no more.</span> <span id="s1823">So you thought that they’re out there, and that they can’t write, they have to work, and thing, and but nobody thought that they would go in the gas chamber, they would be shot and -- and -- and -- by the hundreds and by the thousands, nobody knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: But at the same time, you certainly didn’t want to be deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: Oh no, nobody wanted to be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Right, you -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: I mean, after all, I mean you lived somewheres, you were wi -- in your house, and with your -- in your apartment, with your mother or with your parents, whatever the case might be.</span> <span id="s1828">You don’t want to all of a sudden be shipped to Riga, or somewheres.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1830">Do you -- do you feel a difference between when you first arrived in Berlin in ’38, and when you’re in forced labor in 1941 and 1942?</span> <span id="s1831">Do you feel that things are getting somehow worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1833">You saw them getting worse, you didn’t have to feel it even.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: You saw?</span> <span id="s1835">A: I mean, they had the benches, no Jews allowed, and you -- you were not allowed any more to use public transportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: And things like that you weren’t allowed, out in the street after eight o’clock in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: So everything is getting tighter and more difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Oh definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: And -- and what about your food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: Well, we got very little food.</span> <span id="s1842">During the war you had to either -- if you had some money, you could try to get some food on the black market.</span> <span id="s1843">To ga -- some people, Jewish people that had connections [indecipherable] they wouldn’t tell you, but if you gave them money, they would get you, let’s say -- they had tea tablets, you know, that you could buy, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Tea tablets?</span> <span id="s1845">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: It was pressed tea that were pressed, it looked like an aspirin pill, but it was brown of course, and when you dissolved it in hot water, became tea --</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s1850">It might not have been the best of teas, but was tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: But it was something, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Was not Pekoe in Pekoe tea, but it was some -- some kind of a tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Yeah, quite often.</span> <span id="s1855">Quite often I was hungry, because my mother said to me, you know, I was a finicky eater when I was a small kid, very bad.</span> <span id="s1856">I -- in fact, once it was so bad that the doctor insisted my mother would weigh everything that I ate, to make sure that I got enough food in me.</span> <span id="s1857">And my mother said to me, “Years ago, when I had the food, you didn’t want to eat.</span> <span id="s1858">Now you want to eat and I haven’t got any food to give you.”</span> <span id="s1859">And then my mother was not the type that would s -- I don’t know, she was thin, and she didn -- maybe she didn’t eat that much.</span> <span id="s1860">And I know other friends, they used to buy on the black market, they had chickens, and all kinds of things that they would buy, steaks.</span> <span id="s1861">We never saw anything like that.</span> <span id="s1862">I mean, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1863">And you know, I was hungry, sure.</span> <span id="s1864">You get nothing but beets.</span> <span id="s1865">And people run out already of fantasies how to make these beets, to make fat, you di -- or oil you didn’t get.</span> <span id="s1866">So we had to -- I don’t know how they made the beets, they cooked them, I guess, in water.</span> <span id="s1867">Water was still available.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: And there was no such thing as -- well, bread you got very little, very little.</span> <span id="s1870">Butter, maybe a -- like three or four pads of butter like you get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Little pats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: -- [indecipherable] the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: And of course I was hungry, I mean, I was a growing boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1876">When did you lose the maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: The maid I lost in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1880">My mother just couldn’t afford it any more, I don’t know if she -- I don’t know what c-caused her to make --</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: So did you not -- did you end up not being able to see her, or did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: I couldn’t see her any more, she want back to Saarbrucken --</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Oh, I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: -- and I was in Cologne at that time, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: The maid was not Jewish, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1887">Oh, there was also a law, the maid had to be -- well, and they wouldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: They wouldn’t allow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: -- have any things to do with my mother, but if there was a house over there, was a Jewish male, a maid had to be a certain age to be employed there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1891">They had to be over 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1896">You are still living at home, right, going back and forth to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Are you -- are you getting weaker physically --</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: N --</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: -- in those two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: Maybe a little bit, but not t-to the extent --</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Not too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: -- like in Auschwitz, you know.</span> <span id="s1904">Auschwitz wa -- the -- was really the -- the end of it, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: -- because you got nothing there, I mean nothing to speak of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: But you have friends, and you have a girlfriend, where d -- where do all of you go?</span> <span id="s1908">Wh -- ho -- how do you have social life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: Oh, this is a good thing you mentioned, I got to explain this to you.</span> <span id="s1910">I had a -- I used to walk.</span> <span id="s1911">I used to walk for hours.</span> <span id="s1912">I used to walk from my house to the Iranischestrasse, which was some trip.</span> <span id="s1913">I would say it took about at least two hours to walk it, but I was young, I could walk it, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: And why --</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: And in the morning when I went to work

<p><span id="s1918">Q: And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: And you couldn’t use -- I remember I ha -- one lucky break was I had one friend who lived in an area where I had to use the -- the subway that I always used to get to the Unharda barnholf, and what I did is I would walk to the Unharda barnholf, I would go up, use the tickets for this, so I came from [indecipherable] I worked there, and then right to the -- to the end where he lived, you know?</span> <span id="s1920">You had to use ingenuity in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: And how could you get on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Well, I had a card.</span> <span id="s1923">Y-You had a -- you ha -- you had the -- the ticket, you were just only allowed to use it --</span></p> <p><span

that I used that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: As a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: -- and -- and make believe that I came from work, which I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: So when you were going to see Ellen and your other friends, your male friends, who also may or may not have had girlfriends, did you meet in people’s houses and have a party?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1931">We used to meet in houses, and have parties.</span> <span id="s1932">I mean, first of all, I had one friend -- Ellen had a friend, a girlfriend, her mother was half Jewish, and we used to meet at their house, and we used to have a little party.</span> <span id="s1933">We had the phonograph, we used to dance to records, you know, and yeah, we had parties in people’s houses, as you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: And were you still able to read, did you -- ye -- did you have to give up books?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: Well, we had books in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: You had books in the house.</span> <span id="s1937">And was there a -- a library that was just for the -- the Jews, that there --</span></p> <p><span

it.</span> <span id="s1944">And next to us there was a family, they hid, during the Kristallnacht, they his some Jewish people in their back rooms, and they always gave me American books and things to read, you know, and this is how I got books.</span> <span id="s1945">There were some people who were decent, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: Very few.</span> <span id="s1948">You could come -- you can tell that I can remember most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: There are not too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: So could you read English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: A little, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: I took English in school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: So that was good.</span> <span id="s1956">Okay, I think what we’ll do is we’ll take a break, and we’ll start with your evacuation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Were you smoking before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: When did you start smoking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: Oh, I was maybe 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Why did you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Because I enjoyed doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1967">And you were still able to get cigarettes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yeah, then there was -- you were still able, before the war, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: But after the war started, after ’39, was it harder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: Oh, you couldn’t e -- cigarettes were rationed.</span> <span id="s1973">We used to get some weak cigarettes that must have been from occupied Greece, they were horrible.</span> <span id="s1974">They tasted like cardboard, they were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: Cardboard, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: There was earlier a good Macedonian tobacco that they used to have, but before the war, yeah, I used to smoke a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Did you drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: Never drank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1982">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: I never had the desire for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: When we ended the last tape, we were close to the deportation to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1985">So you were working in factories for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: And there are a number of deportations starting in 1941, and then in ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Are you worried that -- that it’s obviously going to get to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Well, eventually, yeah, of course we were worried that it would get to us eventually.</span> <span id="s1991">But you always figured a ba -- at first they used to have a lot of people that were originally from Poland and Russia, Jews from Poland and Russia they would deport.</span> <span id="s1992">I don’t know, a -- they deport of course, young Jews as well.</span> <span id="s1993">And at the beginning they all went somewheres to Latvia and place.</span> <span id="s1994">Lodz, I remember it was -- it was another place, but of course we -- everybody worried, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: It was a tight situation, and you can’t never tell who was next, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Did you think in some ways being German Jewish would be helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Oh, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: Not any more?</span> <span id="s2002">Because you weren’t German any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: According to the -- the German government.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: We were stateless, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: So, was the -- there was something called the Fabrikaktion, which was the -- the -- the aktion --</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: The Fabrikaktion, yeah, that was when they took from the factories and the workplaces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Yeah, is -- is that how you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: I was deported because gr -- I don’t know whether it was called the Fabrikaktion, I was deported because that was the year when Goebbels had promised Hitler to make Berlin Jew free.</span> <span id="s2012">It was -- the -- the Grossaktion they called it, in fact they were so busy, I was picked up wi -- I was working at the station, I had seen my mother ba -- be -- we went to -- she went to the subway, and I went to the -- to the other train, the elevated trains.</span> <span id="s2013">And was the last time I saw her.</span> <span id="s2014">And when we got to where we first were, all of a sudden they said we should go to the -- th -- another spot on the -- on the -- the station, and there the SS was there, and loaded us up in trains, you know -- in -- in trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: So where were you working at that -- at that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: At the -- at the -- at the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: So you had gone from leather, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: To

fired from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: From the leather you got fired, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: N -- oh, from the painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: From the painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: You got fired because you had the appendic --</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Yeah, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: -- appendicitis, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: Yeah, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: So then where -- so what was your next job then?</span> <span id="s2030">Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: The railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: The railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: What were you doing at the railroad station?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Loading and unloading freight cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2037">And that’s where they -- they moved you onto trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2039">In fact, I was moved by the Leibstandarte, Hitler’s own guard, because they were so busy hunting Jews that it took every SS available.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2041">And how many of you were taken in these trucks?</span> <span id="s2042">How -- how many do you remember?</span> <span id="s2043">50 - 100, or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: I don’t remember exactly how many were taken in each truck, but it wasn’t a long ride to begin with, it was only a 15 minute ride maybe, to get to the -- to that area where they put us in the -- we used -- it used to be schools, Jewish schools, which were not allowed any more, and they used them as -- just for us to s -- it had s-straw mattresses on the floor and we would sleep on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: So where did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: They took me s -- in -- in North Berlin it was, I think, rosenth -- no, not Rosenthalestrasse.</span> <span id="s2049">What was that called, that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: Was it Putlitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Was it Putlitz that they took you, or not?</span> <span id="s2053">Putlitz?</span> <span id="s2054">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: No, that was the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: You mean [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: That’s where -- that’s where you ended up being deported from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: So, where you were evacua --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: I -- I could have been the [indecipherable] Hamburgerstrasse --</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: -- or, I don’t know, I guess it was one of -- one of these things.</span> <span id="s2064">I was not with my mother, my mother was arrested separately.</span> <span id="s2065">There was a girl, a friend of Ellen’s and mine who worked also with us in the leather good factory, she was half Jewish, and she was also arrested, but she got out and she told me after the war, that my mother was in that things -- in that camp there, waiting to be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: So were -- were you in a large room, wherever this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: I-It had -- each -- each classroom had people sleeping on the floor in there, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: And there was a doctor and his wife, they committed suicide, we found them dead in the morning, he must have injected himself with something.</span> <span id="s2070">A lot of people committed suicide.</span> <span id="s2071">Most people don’t realize that a lot of Jewish people -- I knew another doctor who also committed suicide.</span> <span id="s2072">He was a tip -- a pediatrician.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: And how did most people commit suicide as far as you know, with poison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Taking pills, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Taking pills?</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: So do you think they d --</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: Or cut their th -- cut their wrists, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2080">Do you think they knew what was happening, or thought this was going to happen, or this was just too much --</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Well, I ge -- I’m not sure whether they knew, but they probably figured the worst to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: And I would imagine that -- well, there are some people -- you know, there are some people they right away -- they can’t cope right away --</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: -- but they’re not [indecipherable] the -- the -- they -- they -- it so -- it so happened they figured right, you know?</span> <span id="s2086">But I don’t know whether they really knew, perhaps, or saw documents proving that there would be gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2088">In this group that you were in, were there any friends of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: So were you sticking close together, so whatever happened you would be together?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: All the people who got arrested from that railroad station were there, and the -- I -- I knew them all, because we worked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: Also was in there a friend of mine -- you know, I -- I can’t at the moment think of his name, but I -- I sh-shall at a later -- probably a later time remember the name, and his wife had given birth to a baby, and she was still in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2094">And he got word out, he paid somebody, because some of the half Jewish people, they were like [indecipherable] they were doing things for the -- for the people.</span> <span id="s2095">And he gave him money and he went to the Jewish hospital and told his wife about it.</span> <span id="s2096">And his wife immediately came and the baby, she was -- she wasn’t even in the hospital a day or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: When she came --</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: And we had already prepared for -- for -- to having a little celebration, we had taken food rations and put them away, so we have a little party.</span> <span id="s2099">And she came to the -- to the staging area where we were -- all were.</span> <span id="s2100">And she died, you know, she was killed, and the kid was killed, and he died later.</span> <span id="s2101">[coughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Are you okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Yeah, I’m all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: You’re all right?</span> <span id="s2105">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: What happened was that -- in fact, I saw him, he was a very strong fellow, he used to -- he could lift, and everything, I mean he was stronger -- a real strong guy.</span> <span id="s2107">When I saw him die in Buna, he was like a unbelievable hardly to cri -- you could hardly recognize him.</span> <span id="s2108">He asked me for a piece of bread, and I didn’t have anything to give him.</span> <span id="s2109">And I felt terrible about it, because if I’d had -- even the piece of bread wouldn’t have helped him any.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2111">H-How many --</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: He was called -- what they -- th-they used to call him musselman, you heard that expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Musselman was somebody who was already emaciated to a point where there was absolutely no help any more.</span> <span id="s2115">And those were the people that usually got gassed, that they used to see them, and they would herd them onto a transport and gas them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: And he -- his wife pa -- I mean, it was -- was horrible, just awful.</span> <span id="s2118">I never saw the baby -- I mean, I saw the baby, but I don’t remember seeing the baby, because the baby was only a couple of days old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2120">Do you remember how many days you were waiting to be taken on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: Yeah, I think it was about two or three days, and then finally the SS was standing, I remember when you looked out the window, you saw the SS there with machine pistols, and [indecipherable] I saw them right there with their lead group, Hitler’s guards, you know, that they had in the chancellery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: That you should come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: And -- and they shoved us into the -- those trucks, you know, they had like a canvas around them, put us in there, they brought us to that railroad station there.</span> <span id="s2124">I remember it was in the winter, and it was snowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Tell me a couple of things.</span> <span id="s2126">What did you eat when you were there?</span> <span id="s2127">Di -- had -- did you bring food with you, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: No, we had no food that we brought with us.</span> <span id="s2129">I think the Jewish congregation gave us some bread and soup, or whatever there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: So it was now you’re in a worse situation than you had been used to, because you were not getting enough food anyway.</span> <span id="s2131">But now you had even less.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: Yeah, but I’ll tell you something, your mind wasn’t really thinking of food at that time, you know, because now we really knew that we were in the pickle, and we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s2133">And we -- it was so abrupt, I had seen my mother in the morning, and we were working, all of a sudden they took us away, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: And what about toilet facilities where you were staying?</span> <span id="s2135">This is before you get on a truck, in this -- in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: In -- the toilet facilities -- remember it was a school, they had toilet facilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: So that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: I mean Berlin was a town, th-they had sewerage, and wa -- there were toilet facilities</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2140">So yo -- when -- were you wearing winter clothes?</span> <span id="s2141">Were you wearing a jacket?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Yeah, I was wearing a jacket --</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: And did you have the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: -- because I was working outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2146">So you had good shoes for the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: Yeah, I had boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: So that was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: Yeah, but they were taken away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: I mean, you had to strip --</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: I got these wooden shoes with a canvas top there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2155">So tell me -- you were in a freight car, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: And do you have any idea about how many people were in each car?</span> <span id="s2158">In your car, forget each car, in your car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Yeah, I would say at least 70 people.</span> <span id="s2160">In other words, so many that we couldn’t arrange to sit down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: So you were standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: We -- we were trying everything, we p -- between sip -- spr -- spread our legs and have somebody else sit in between.</span> <span id="s2163">And there were always people, about 15 or 20 people who were still standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: Standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: So what I did is, I didn’t sit down at all, I stood near the door there, and held onto that iron rod.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Does that mean you were near the -- the little window?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: I was near the little window, I was near that door that rolls --</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: [indecipherable] work -- that runs on a track.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: And I was standing there for all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: And do you -- do you know how long the trip was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Yes, I’d say about two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: Two days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: Did you get any food, any water?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: No.</span> <span id="s2180">We got nothing.</span> <span id="s2181">We begged the SS to give us, because it was snowing, and we could have gotten snow, that would have helped us, you know?</span> <span id="s2182">They didn’t give us anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: Did people die?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: Anyone you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: No, at that time, not -- nobody I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Was this the first time that you had been near people who were dead, besides your -- your father at a funeral?</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: Yeah, I would say so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: Did you -- did you react in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: You got so many things on your mind, once you get there, you know, in that situation, you get really numb, and you -- you don’t feel any -- anything at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: What were -- were you thinking about anything when you were on the train?</span> <span id="s2194">Or were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: Yeah, I was thinking I would have liked to know where we are going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2197">And did you talk with people and say where do you think we’re going?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: And they used to say, I think we are going in an easterly direction, which was toward Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: And we passed -- you could sometimes see -- they had this little slot there, that window, had like barbed wire on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: But you could see some things.</span> <span id="s2205">You could catch -- at night you couldn’t see too well, but in the daytime.</span> <span id="s2206">And we knew we passed Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, not Frankfurt on [indecipherable], Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, which is on it’s way to Poland, so -- going east, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: And then all of a sudden the guy says where we were already near the [indecipherable], he said there was a sign to -- Nach Auschwitz, so and so many kilometers or something on the road.</span> <span id="s2209">Then we knew where we were going.</span> <span id="s2210">And then -- nobody knew of course about ausch -- I knew about Auschwitz, but I -- because I heard that story.</span> <span id="s2211">But I still didn’t believe that they had gas chambers there, I mean, I -- I thought it was a labor camp, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: But we got there, I think it was nighttime.</span> <span id="s2214">It was darker now, and they opened up the -- these sliding doors, and they told us raus, raus, you know, out, out, out, and beat us up riz -- it c-came as a big surprise, you know, because I had never been beaten up by anybody before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: I mean, I didn’t do anything bad.</span> <span id="s2217">And -- and we -- we went out there as fast as we could, and that’s when th -- they started to form the lines, there was an SS man there, and -- where the door -- where they had the door [indecipherable] said, “You go on this side, you go on this side.”</span> <span id="s2218">This side, go over this side, this -- well, I don’t know, I was going on the side he told me, I didn’t know where I was, and where wa -- wa -- the other side must have one the -- been the gas chamber, but I didn’t know, I mean, I just went on the side because I was told to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: And then all of a sudden, while they were still waiting there for the gas chamber procedure, trucks came.</span> <span id="s2221">And they loaded us on those trucks, and jus -- they brought us to Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: And this is a -- all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: All men --</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: All men</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: -- yeah, all men.</span> <span id="s2226">Buna didn’t have a wi -- didn’t have a women’s camp.</span> <span id="s2227">Auschwitz and Buna were me -- a m -- m -- a male camps, and Birkenau, or whatever they called it in Polish, was a women’s camp.</span> <span id="s2228">And Birkenau was also where the gas installations were.</span> <span id="s2229">They also had one in the main camp, but I don’t -- I don’t know whether they u -- they had used it at several occasions, but I think it -- it went out of use when I was there already.</span> <span id="s2230">I don’t remember any transports there, I mean, possible that there were some when I wasn’t there, when I was at work, I don’t know, but I’ve never seen any there in -- in our camp.</span> <span id="s2231">Course that’s see that we -- we smelled it, you know, we -- in Auschwitz you could smell that for miles, and people who knew that s -- they were burning people.</span> <span id="s2232">Even the -- the Polish people knew about it, you know, so they were not in the ca -- not a lot of them were not in the camp, but little town of Oswiecim, Auschwitz, you could smell that, you could smell it all over the area.</span> <span id="s2233">It was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Did you -- did you realize very quickly what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: Oh yeah, once I was there, then -- and they told us, they said, “You know, you’re lucky you’re here, because all the others there at the station, they already dead, they already gassed and burned.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: And did you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: So we knew what was going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: And did you say, oh my God, this guy was right.</span> <span id="s2239">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: No, I didn’t say anything, I took it -- but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: You just took it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2243">And I remember the first meal they give [indecipherable], they got tattooed, you know, I had to stand in line and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: Now are you at Buna when they register you, and not in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Well, Buna is part of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: I -- no, no, I understand that.</span> <span id="s2247">But it’s Auschwitz III</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">A: It’s Auschwitz -- Auschwitz III --</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: Yeah, it is ausch -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: -- or Auschwitz II, I forgot already.</span> <span id="s2251">And yeah [indecipherable] we had to go to the bath house, and they shaved us, and then we had to take a cold shower, and then they put some kind of a kerosene on our bodies, I guess to prevent lice, or flea -- they had them anyways there, but it was a procedure.</span> <span id="s2252">And then we had to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: And they shaved your whole body --</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">Q: -- not just your hair, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">A: Yeah, and then we had to go to -- to be tattooed, so I was standing there, and waiting, and I fell asleep, because I had -- this was already the third day that I was standing on my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: So you fell asleep standing up, while waiting, or you sat down?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: No, I stood up.</span> <span id="s2259">I didn’t know the line had moved, and I hadn’t moved with them.</span> <span id="s2260">All of a sudden somebody hit me in the face, my head turned from one side to the other.</span> <span id="s2261">And they put a tattoo on a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: Do you remember them putting a tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: Yeah, 106377.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: 106377.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: Did it hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: Yeah, it hurt.</span> <span id="s2268">But I didn’t feel it that much because we were in the -- you were so shocked, you know, in a state of shock, almost.</span> <span id="s2269">But you could feel it, it was bleeding too, you know, the blood came out with the ink together there.</span> <span id="s2270">No, there were some people that got sick from it, you know, they got the infections from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: And then we got the prison garb.</span> <span id="s2273">Pair of these boots, you know.</span> <span id="s2274">Kapo took my boots away from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: So you got wooden shoes, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: I got wooden shoes, yeah.</span> <span id="s2277">And these wooden shoes, they were one size, you know, th-there were no such thing as different sizes.</span> <span id="s2278">And they were very hard to wear because they rubbed, you know, the thing rubbed on the -- used to get all kinds of infections on the -- on your -- on the boot -- I got kicked by an SS man, and they used to have these nails on the [indecipherable] right away.</span> <span id="s2279">He tore off a piece of flesh, and it start to bleed.</span> <span id="s2280">You can’t do nothing about it, and so I covered -- paper ban -- paper bandages for the prisoners there, as long as the supply lasted, and I put it around it, and I went to work, and I put the sa -- my socks on the bed.</span> <span id="s2281">And at night the thing was stuck -- my sock was stuck to the -- to -- to -- to the open wound, you know.</span> <span id="s2282">And you had to tear it off, so that it never really healed, it took -- festered for months and months and months.</span> <span id="s2283">I was lucky, a lot of people died from where they -- they got infections and they had to take the foot off, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2284">But I guess in -- in that instance I was lucky, because eventually it started to heal.</span> <span id="s2285">It’s still a little purplish today, but it is -- course, it’s healed, after so many years.</span> <span id="s2286">And -- and then firs -- I remember the first time they gave us food, it was sauerkraut with rotten apples in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Sauerkraut?</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: That was the meal.</span> <span id="s2291">Was some kind of kraut, must have been sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s2292">And I couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s2293">You should have seen -- I couldn’t understand how fast the other guys, they were fighting over it, hitting each other, they p -- but in a minute it was gone, you know.</span> <span id="s2294">And I didn’t he -- I couldn’t understand what was such a big attraction, you know, this bowl of sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s2295">But later I knew what it was, that these people were starved, you know?</span> <span id="s2296">And they looked it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: But you can’t pay attention to these things at first, you know?</span> <span id="s2299">It’s just the way -- didn’t want to eat it, and somebody else ate it.</span> <span id="s2300">That’s the whole story behind it.</span> <span id="s2301">Then we got -- in the morning we used to get the bread.</span> <span id="s2302">That was the big occasion, yeah, two slices of bread, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2303">And you had to eat it fast, because if you didn’t watch that bread, it was gone, someone would steal it.</span> <span id="s2304">Also, there was rules, and anybody who stole bread would be hanged, you know?</span> <span id="s2305">And they did it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: The Germans had this rule?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: But you -- you were still people that tried, and people were desperate, hungry, you know?</span> <span id="s2310">You know.</span> <span id="s2311">And you’ve -- there was no way of really keeping that bread.</span> <span id="s2312">If you took it with you to work, you wo -- it fell apart in your pocket, you know, because it was so [indecipherable] I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s2313">I don’t know even [indecipherable] the SS is sure what it was.</span> <span id="s2314">It was something that they concocted there.</span> <span id="s2315">And for lunch, we had a soup, about a liter.</span> <span id="s2316">You know what a liter is?</span> <span id="s2317">A liter is less than a quart.</span> <span id="s2318">Everything that he -- when they cooked for the SS, and all the other leaves that were rotten also, they made a soup for us out of.</span> <span id="s2319">They also had some kinds -- they used to take -- from the fields they used to take some kind of a growing thing there and they put that in the soup, and that’s like little greens [indecipherable] in the soup, I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s2320">It was some kind of a weed, I would imagine.</span> <span id="s2321">And that was the -- that was the lunch, that’s all you got.</span> <span id="s2322">And then you had to wait for the next day to get something again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: So there was no supper?</span> <span id="s2324">Nothing at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: Only breakfast and lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: Were some people getting packages -- not Jews, I mean, were some --</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: No, Jews didn’t get packages, Poles did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Right, but the -- the Poles did, but I mean these people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Yeah, and the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: Did any of them share?</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2334">They didn’t share anything.</span> <span id="s2335">If you were lucky, if you cleaned the bowls for them, they would leave a little bit for su -- of something in there, whatever it was, you know?</span> <span id="s2336">You didn’t get anything to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: Did it shock you the way people were behaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: Yeah, it was kind of unusual, you know, to me, but [indecipherable] the people -- I’ll tell you something, people went in, their character actually never really changed.</span> <span id="s2339">There were those that were decent people, they acted like human beings.</span> <span id="s2340">There were those that were just like animals, you know?</span> <span id="s2341">They probably were in real life like that as well, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A: I imagine.</span> <span id="s2344">And I had seen people that used to fight and steal, and you couldn’t repor -- I wouldn’t report them, because I knew if I report them they -- they going to die.</span> <span id="s2345">And then, besides that, it was not too good to talk with these kapos, because it’s -- whatever mood they were in, they would hit you, or wouldn’t believe you, or kick you, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2346">So you pretty much kept to yourself.</span> <span id="s2347">But there were some people who were pretty rough, you know?</span> <span id="s2348">And the roughest of them all was the Sonderkommando, the person that [indecipherable] had the gas and burned the j -- the Jewish people, you know.</span> <span id="s2349">I mean, they didn’t gas them, they put them in the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A: And the SS used to put the gas in on the top, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: But we had every day this -- the SS used to try to instill into us not to try to escape or something.</span> <span id="s2354">And no, you couldn’t escape from Auschwitz, it was just impossible.</span> <span id="s2355">First of all, you had an inside wire that was electrically charged.</span> <span id="s2356">Then you had a -- a -- a wall that was made out of -- like the Berlin wall, like a plat -- bitum, or plaster, whatever you call that.</span> <span id="s2357">And then you had the guard towers.</span> <span id="s2358">I mean, every street in the concentration camp was watched -- you know, on each end there was a guard tower, you know?</span> <span id="s2359">The Auschwitz camp itself was not even that large, but they concentrated so many people in one spot, and that’s how they could hold so many people.</span> <span id="s2360">And then they were the outside camps, you know, part -- Auschwitz I, II and III.</span> <span id="s2361">So you hold that -- and besides that, even let’s say, even if a person would have been able to get out, where would they have gone?</span> <span id="s2362">Would have gone into another concentration camp, cause there was Birkenau, there was Buna, there was Auschwitz I, the main camp.</span> <span id="s2363">And there were concentration camp all over the place.</span> <span id="s2364">And besides, the SS were always on the lookout for something to happen, you know?</span> <span id="s2365">They had dogs they would let them loose there.</span> <span id="s2366">So there were only two people that I know of that got out of that camp, that was Rudi Vrba and his friend.</span> <span id="s2367">He got out because he was privileged.</span> <span id="s2368">In other words, he worked for Kanada.</span> <span id="s2369">Kanada was the place where all the goods came together [indecipherable] the people they robbed, the suitcases.</span> <span id="s2370">And they found diamonds, they found all kinds of things, food.</span> <span id="s2371">And they assorted it.</span> <span id="s2372">Of course, sometimes the kapos did trade with the SS, you know?</span> <span id="s2373">They said the SS would give them something, food, and they -- and they would give them the diamonds or whatever.</span> <span id="s2374">And privileged people -- there was a -- ba -- a better class in Auschwitz, like on the outside world, there was a dynasty.</span> <span id="s2375">I mean there were people who had [indecipherable] and then there the real poor, like me.</span> <span id="s2376">Like a lot of others.</span> <span id="s2377">So Vrba got out because he got ahold of Russian tobacco, and they tra -- they somehow soaked that in some kind of an oil, and the dogs would not smell it, the dogs would not bark.</span> <span id="s2378">They were hiding i-in the -- in the -- in a wooden shed there -- not a shed, it was like some kind of wooden thing that they had piled up, and they were inside.</span> <span id="s2379">And of course when they were missing, the sirens started to wail, and they went -- but the SS almost caught them.</span> <span id="s2380">The guy says to, “Did you look in that thing there?”</span> <span id="s2381">He says -- he lifted up one board, said, “There’s nobody in there.”</span> <span id="s2382">So after three days they gave -- give up the search, and that’s when they went out at night, and fled.</span> <span id="s2383">But aside from that, I don’t s -- remember anybody escaping from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: I’m afraid we have to stop and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: Actually, I was going to say on -- on camera, there were a few other people who escaped, and there was another pair that escaped a few weeks after Wetzler and Vrba.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: And they met up together in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s2390">So they all were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: Oh yeah, I think I read that in a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2394">But not too many --</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: No, not a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: -- if you -- if you consider how many people were at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2398">What sort of work were they making you do in Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: Oh, when I got there first, we had a roll call in the morning, and they these kapos, they were usually from German penitentiaries, you know, they were pa -- killers and all kinds of criminals.</span> <span id="s2400">And he pulled me over to his side there, and they -- there were people standing already, and then you had enough people, he -- we marched out, we got to a place that was full of cement bags, and it was -- I remember there was a small, miniature railroad track, and they had these little lorries on it, they were like came to a point at the end, and opened wun -- wide on the -- on the top.</span> <span id="s2401">And I don’t know any more, I don’t remember what these were for, but I -- we had to take the cement bags from one end, the SS was standing on one end, and the kapos were standing the other -- we had to take it just -- somebody put a cement bag on your back, you had to run over to the other end and put it there.</span> <span id="s2402">And on the -- then you had to run back again to get the second wa -- one.</span> <span id="s2403">You know, the people died in that p -- in that [indecipherable] you could -- just couldn’t keep it up.</span> <span id="s2404">I kept up as long as I could, you know, and I -- all day, when I came back is -- into the camp, I thought I’d die of -- I was such exhausted, you know.</span> <span id="s2405">But second day I made sure that this kapo wouldn’t get me.</span> <span id="s2406">I figured if this is the worst, I mean it can’t get any worse than that.</span> <span id="s2407">So went [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2408">What happened is we had to build the I. G. Farben Buna plant there, that’s right, it was called Buna.</span> <span id="s2409">Buna was an artificial rubber product, was used for s-shoe soles and things like that.</span> <span id="s2410">We had to carry metal rods that were very long, I remember, and they were a part -- I would say at least 20 -- 25 prisoners to one rod -- to wa -- that’s how long they were.</span> <span id="s2411">But when you worked there, there were p-parts where you had to climb up the hill.</span> <span id="s2412">When they climb up the hill you had all that weight on you.</span> <span id="s2413">It was agony, believe me.</span> <span id="s2414">You had to carry that things, and then th -- you had to go up, and you were glad when you were on top of the hill that you didn’t -- some of the weight was already distributed more, on a regular basis, like.</span> <span id="s2415">In other words, the other ones were carrying it as well.</span> <span id="s2416">And that’s was all there was to do in this camp, there were -- there was one Italian that made gas out of rotten foods, or what -- I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s2417">Rotten t -- [indecipherable] it stank terrible, it was -- it was called faulgas, and faul means foul, you know?</span> <span id="s2418">Gas.</span> <span id="s2419">And there were no cushiony jobs th -- in -- in Buna, at least not at the time when I was there, and in Buna they had latrines.</span> <span id="s2420">And I remember one night -- first of all there was -- t-they gave you a [indecipherable] pockets for people to urinate in.</span> <span id="s2421">And the last one that came there, and it was full, had to go -- and nobody wanted to go and fa -- with the cold outside.</span> <span id="s2422">So if you didn’t go --</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: You had to take it outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: I go there once, and I figure oh, still good enough.</span> <span id="s2425">All of a sudden I got hit over the head, and the kapo was there, “Get out with that damn thing you son of a bitch.”</span> <span id="s2426">And he threw me out, you know, [indecipherable] was kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2427">So I figure since I’m in the toilet already, might as well empty myself completely.</span> <span id="s2428">I sit down, all of a sudden I feel some -- something touching me on the shoulder.</span> <span id="s2429">I look up, there’s a guy hanging on the -- on the -- on the blankets, i -- pi -- hung himself, you know?</span> <span id="s2430">And he was dancing on my shoulder when I was sitting, you know?</span> <span id="s2431">And it did -- did not phase me because it was nat -- that was a natural thing.</span> <span id="s2432">I mean it’s like, if you go in the swimming pool, you expect to get wet, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A: And when you in -- and when you’re there, you expect to see these things, I mean, that -- hangings.</span> <span id="s2435">Then they had something that was called sport.</span> <span id="s2436">After work -- well, I -- I don’t know whether I told you that we had to, when we made the bunks, the bunk consisted of a straw mattress, and a -- and a wedge pillow, a very thin wedge pillow, and a blanket, of course.</span> <span id="s2437">Thin blanket, to be sure.</span> <span id="s2438">And in the morning when we made that bed, that had to be done in the military fashion.</span> <span id="s2439">There were two guys that started from the first bed to the last one, they had the string, and these pi -- these wedge pillows and the -- and that blanket, they had to perfectly align.</span> <span id="s2440">There had to be a crease in it, you know?</span> <span id="s2441">So that they all fit in the crease [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2442">So I don’t know, we p -- goofed, or somebody goofed.</span> <span id="s2443">I don’t know, maybe I goofed, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s2444">That means you have sport.</span> <span id="s2445">After they came back from work, they s -- bunks [indecipherable] so and so, you’re all going out for sport.</span> <span id="s2446">Well, the sport consisted of carrying a very long ladder.</span> <span id="s2447">That ladder was almost as long as from this end here of the room to the -- to this end.</span> <span id="s2448">And each person had to take one of the sprockets, one of the things oh -- in his shoulder, we had to run across and sing, and we had to say, “We are supposed to be clean, we are supposed to make our beds right, we are not,” -- all this.</span> <span id="s2449">And that went on --depends how -- what mood they -- they -- the kapo was.</span> <span id="s2450">It was a very cold day, and he was cold himself, it didn’t last as long.</span> <span id="s2451">But on the sunny day, believe me, you could -- could go on for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: So you would keep running back and forth, singing this song?</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: We had to ro -- run around with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: In a circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: Yeah, well -- [indecipherable] the whole camp area there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: And would everybody be watching?</span> <span id="s2459">Who was there, who was watching this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: No, you di -- don’t have to watch it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: Just the kapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: Just us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: It was a punishment.</span> <span id="s2465">And this was one of the lesser punishments, the worse punishment was when they gave you 25 beatings, you know?</span> <span id="s2466">They -- you heard about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Did you ever get that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: No.</span> <span id="s2469">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2470">I almost got it, but it wa -- the Russians were coming already, they couldn’t do it no more, because it was a very cold winter, that -- that wi-winter of 1944 and ’45.</span> <span id="s2471">And I was working outside.</span> <span id="s2472">I was carrying up bricks, unloading bricks, and was very cold, so one of the guys said, you know, “Let’s go inside in wa -- in the factory and warm up.”</span> <span id="s2473">So we did.</span> <span id="s2474">Well, we came out [indecipherable] wrote our numbers down.</span> <span id="s2475">Report tonight to the kapo, the 25.</span> <span id="s2476">Well, it didn’t -- it didn’t go back to ca -- I mean, we went back, but they had no time to do it, because the Russians were too darn close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: You could hear already the artillery, and you saw the fires of the grenades and everything.</span> <span id="s2479">So I got away with it.</span> <span id="s2480">But in Auschwitz, they had very -- in --in --especially in Buna, the very cruel method.</span> <span id="s2481">When I got to Auschwitz, they had all kinds of ways of killing people.</span> <span id="s2482">With the spades, or they lay them down on the ground on their stomach, and they take a -- a broom, or a -- a shovel, and the -- the -- the kapo would step on him and break the guys nec -- neck.</span> <span id="s2483">All these things we had.</span> <span id="s2484">Then we had to bring them in.</span> <span id="s2485">At night we had to bring the dead in, you know, they had like a little carriage there, a little wagon -- four wheel wagon -- two wheel wagon it was.</span> <span id="s2486">And that’s where we put the corpses in and then we had to -- because everybody had to be counted where -- there was no such thing -- if somebody died, he had to be laid out during the roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: So that they could count.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: They would take the count, you know, because otherwise how would they know that nobody escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: So how did you have s -- strength at the beginning to be carrying these --</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">A: Because I had done physical work all this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">A: On the railroad station, all o -- but eventually, also, I lost a lot of weight, you know?</span> <span id="s2495">And when you lose a lot of weight you got to be careful because they got those selections in the camp.</span> <span id="s2496">They would call a -- they would close the camp up completely, nobody can go in to work, and out of -- out to work or anything.</span> <span id="s2497">And then you had to undress in front of the -- the shower room there, which was in essence a barrack with two doors on each end, you know?</span> <span id="s2498">And you had -- you knew what -- what this was all about, because we knew they made the selections, we never -- once you in the camp you know all about it.</span> <span id="s2499">So we had to undress completely n -- completely naked, and you had your shoes in your hand, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2500">They march you through that -- you had to run though that thing, and there was the SS standing, one guy had the cane, and he had the t -- the end that -- the handle end out, and if he saw somebody that he thought was not able to work any more, he would pull him by the neck over to the side, take his number, and he had to stand there.</span> <span id="s2501">And you walked through it, you know, it -- it was like a Russian Roulette so to speak, in -- in a different fashion.</span> <span id="s2502">And I remember I walked through there, I -- y-you die a thousand deaths because you know what’s happening there.</span> <span id="s2503">And I used to s -- f -- take a deep breath, make my chest come out --</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Your che -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: -- whatever there was left of it, and I ran through it.</span> <span id="s2506">I was lucky, I di -- they didn’t.</span> <span id="s2507">When I was on the other side I thought I -- I’m -- I was a free man again, you know, this was almost how it was because you knew you wouldn’t die, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: How -- how often did they have selections there?</span> <span id="s2509">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: Oh, about four or five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: Every -- every four or five weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2513">Sometimes they had it even more often.</span> <span id="s2514">It all depended how the demand for -- for -- for prisoners was in the camp.</span> <span id="s2515">If they had an overcrowding, then I -- I mean if there were too many within, they figured, oh, might as well take people that are new, they’ve still got strength to do work, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: And we get rid of the old ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: So how many month were you in Buna, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: I got there in February, I say about six or seven month.</span> <span id="s2520">Torture that place was.</span> <span id="s2521">I don’t know, I had some friends that stayed there during the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: What did -- what did you -- when -- when you were in the barrack, or even at work, did you guys talk about anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: No, we were actually not supposed to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Q: You’re not supposed to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: No.</span> <span id="s2526">We -- we would talk though, I mean -- but we didn’t talk about that.</span> <span id="s2527">That was not on our mind, and our mind was where you get this piece of bread, that -- where you can find potato peels, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2528">I remember we used to take potato peels, and -- they had in -- in Auschwitz, they had a -- in Buna, the had a heating system that piped the heat in from one central point into the barracks.</span> <span id="s2529">And we used to take the potato peels, and make a little bowl out of them, and roast them on there to make them hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: That was a delicacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: It was a delicacy, it sure was.</span> <span id="s2532">And water you couldn’t drink there because it contained th-th -- that typhus bacteria, is all kind of things.</span> <span id="s2533">The water was actually red when it came out, I don’t know if --</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Red?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2536">There were a lot of sh -- people that said that’s the blood of the Jews that’s running through it, but this was not the case.</span> <span id="s2537">The case was that the Germans must have bombed the water mains, and -- and probably somehow the rust and everything went in there, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2538">We knew -- there were some people they couldn’t help it, they drank that water.</span> <span id="s2539">Some of them nothing happened to even, but a lot of them died of dysentery, I think it was, or to -- and then you used to go to bed after ti -- they have lice and fleas in this place you wouldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s2540">You laid down, there was like a whole army creeping over your body, you could feel it.</span> <span id="s2541">It was like a never-ending army of -- of fleas and lice.</span> <span id="s2542">You could get rid of them, if a flea hops, and you -- used to get them, you had only one shirt, you know, you had to wear that shirt at night as well, in the morning you got up, the fleas were in the shirt, you had to go to work.</span> <span id="s2543">It was terrible, it was very painful, because they bite, you know, and the -- I don’t know what they had to eat there, because we didn’t have certainly nothing to eat, but they found something.</span> <span id="s2544">And then they -- all of a sudden they said they needed some people for Auschwitz, and I figured, as I said, I’m not going to exist here any longer than over there, so I volunteered for the things, I told a couple [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2545">One day a Red Cross wagon showed up, I said, “Oh my God.”</span> <span id="s2546">That’s already a bad sign, the Red Cross wagon were very closely associated with the -- with the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2547">Had to go in a -- we had no choice, we got to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2548">They brought us --</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: And you -- you’re talking about Auschwitz I now, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: Yeah, the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: I got in there, they put me in the -- what was called the hospital, it was the krankenbau, the building for the sick.</span> <span id="s2553">So I went in there, the SS doctor comes and says, “You don’t look bad.”</span> <span id="s2554">I said, “No, I feel very good, I would like to go to work.”</span> <span id="s2555">He says, “Get the hell out of here,” he says, “go to block 18.”</span> <span id="s2556">And I went to block 18 and I was out.</span> <span id="s2557">But some people were not that lucky.</span> <span id="s2558">There were some of that they were taken right to Birkenau and they were attached to an incoming -- there were always tr -- there were always trains coming in.</span> <span id="s2559">That place was as busy as a -- a bee’s nest.</span> <span id="s2560">You have no idea, one train went out, another one came in.</span> <span id="s2561">That depends on what countries people came from.</span> <span id="s2562">The Hungarian Jews came at the end, and it was a unusual situation with them, you probably heard about it, they were treated like they had the families were together, that their hair wasn’t cut, and all of a sudden, after six, seven months they took them all out and gassed them.</span> <span id="s2563">Kids, and the -- and even the -- the -- there wa -- there was a guy that told them, a Hungarian Jew there, a young fellow.</span> <span id="s2564">He loved those kids and -- and a -- he -- I think he went -- he committed suicide there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q: I think you’re talking about the Theresienstadt camp with Freddie Hirsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: The who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: The theresien -- Theresienstadt family camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: No, no, no, no, no, I’m talking about the Birkenau camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2570">No, no.</span> <span id="s2571">The -- they were in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">A: Oh yeah, they came from Theresienstadt, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: Fro -- from Theresienstadt --</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">Q: -- you said Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">A: Y-Yeah, from Hungary.</span> <span id="s2577">And I remember that night, I was working the night shift in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2578">My friend Itzhak Klein, the gynecologist and I, we worked in a woodworking factory, they made the beds for the -- bunks for the SS, whatever.</span> <span id="s2579">It was a very modern outfit.</span> <span id="s2580">All the shavings, the wood shavings were sucked out onto a big pile on the outside, there was a -- a motor that sucked the thing out.</span> <span id="s2581">There were shavings and things.</span> <span id="s2582">The SS used it a lot when they burned Jews in the open pits, you know, to -- on a rainy day they couldn’t start the fire, they would come over, we had to load it up for them, you know.</span> <span id="s2583">And they were the -- and one of them said once to me, “Don’t take it -- don’t give me all,” he says, “leave some for yourself.”</span> <span id="s2584">This was a nice way of putting it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: Was nice, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: Well anyway, the -- I went in there, and that night, when the Hungarian Jews were driven into the gas chamber, you could -- it sounded like a jungle, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s2587">I can still hear it today in my ears.</span> <span id="s2588">They were screaming like lions, like animals it sounded like in the jungle, you know?</span> <span id="s2589">A horrible noise.</span> <span id="s2590">But that didn’t help them any, they had to go in.</span> <span id="s2591">So th-this was the -- one night they gassed and burned 14,000 people, can you imagine what the -- how many people that is?</span> <span id="s2592">And later when they caught -- when the -- when the Poles caught up with the -- with Hoss, the -- the camp commander.</span> <span id="s2593">There was a Rudolf Hoss, and there was a Rudolf Hess.</span> <span id="s2594">Rudolf Hess was as deputy fuehrer, he does not -- I -- I’m not talking about -- he was already in prison in England at that time.</span> <span id="s2595">I’m talking about Rudolf Hoss, the camp commander, and he said -- he said, “Well, I c -- I couldn’t kill more people,” he said, “because the machinery would have suffered and broken down, and we couldn’t take that chance, we had so many more Jews to kill.”</span> <span id="s2596">But was horrible that night, I remember it.</span> <span id="s2597">We went on top -- that building had three stories, and from the third floor you could see the ovens, ya -- the chimneys, and the fire was coming out there something -- it looked like something was on fire, you know, the building was on fire.</span> <span id="s2598">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2599">And it stank too, oh horrible, horrible smell.</span> <span id="s2600">It smells like if you would take a steak and you put it on a fire without -- and it starts burning, you know, that flesh smell.</span> <span id="s2601">It also went in our hair, because the ashes -- this is very unhealthy climate up there, it is like they got a lot of wus -- stagnant waters there in that area.</span> <span id="s2602">And the -- the -- the ashes, you know, the ashes settles because if there was a low ceiling, the ashes would come down, and goes for miles.</span> <span id="s2603">Would settle on our head, we were shaven.</span> <span id="s2604">Used to come back at night that we had a whole -- whole thing full of ashes on your head, you know, from the burnings.</span> <span id="s2605">You couldn’t take showers there, it was only one shower a week, you know, and it was all there was.</span> <span id="s2606">And you just had to do like this, you know, till everything came --</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: Till it came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: -- most of it came out.</span> <span id="s2609">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: C-Can you go back for minute?</span> <span id="s2611">When the -- when the doctor kicked you out of the hospital, when you first went to Auschwitz I, he said go to barrack 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: What’s barrack 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Barrack 18 -- all -- all the barracks had numbers --</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: -- th-the lower floor was 18, the top was 18A, I think I was in 18A.</span> <span id="s2617">And they had the -- they had this up -- a -- woodworking thing, it was a good [indecipherable] because at least in the winter you could -- you had to go inside, because you had to take that thing in.</span> <span id="s2618">What we did is we had a wooden box about this size, I would say, and this high, and it had two handles on each end.</span> <span id="s2619">And Itzhak Klein would ha -- go in the front, or me in the front, and he was in the back, we would fill this up, bring it inside, and use it in the heating system, they had central heating there.</span> <span id="s2620">We would s -- put it in the ovens there, in the -- in the regular ovens, you know, to heat the building.</span> <span id="s2621">And so at least you had a chance -- when it was -- it’s bitter cold there in the winter, a chance to warm -- get -- get warmed a little.</span> <span id="s2622">We used to go back and forth, and then of course we had to deliver some of it to the SS when they needed it for the burnings there in the -- the open pits, because even though they had, I think four of -- six at the end, I think six gamma -- gas chambers, it didn’t have enough facilities to burn them all at one time.</span> <span id="s2623">So they -- they went again to that system where they had these holes in the ground like they dug holes or [indecipherable] eight or 10 feet in deep, and there -- that’s where they would throw the -- throw the -- the people in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q: So when you say woodworking, you really mean taking pieces of wood to various places, so that you could heat --</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: They would use these -- these shavings, they would put some kind of an oil on it, okay, [indecipherable] and set it on fire, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2627">Did you get more food than at --</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2630">The same food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Yeah, because I was not actively p -- working on the -- wi-with the corpses.</span> <span id="s2632">I was only loading up from that -- from that woodworking place there.</span> <span id="s2633">I didn’t go over them, they only brought the -- the trucks and we loaded them up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: But the work wasn’t as difficult as it was in Buna, or was it?</span> <span id="s2635">Was it -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: No, it was not as difficult as in Buna, it was much, much better than in Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2638">And how did your fr -- this -- this is -- was this friend Klein, was he with you in Buna and he came over, or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">A: I met him a-at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2644">He wer -- I -- no, I don’t think that he ever was in Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: He was in a -- because he came from the ghetto in Plaszow, or whatever, a camp there, and they brought him to Auschwitz, I think they -- I don’t remember anybody from there in Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: Did you at some point escape the gassing?</span> <span id="s2648">Were you protected somehow?</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: Yes, I -- I did, I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s2650">I -- when I worked in this woodworking shop, the Poles, you know, are very anti-Semitic, and -- but they -- I mean, Polish there was the main language spoken, I couldn’t speak Polish, it’s a hard language to learn.</span> <span id="s2651">I was lucky I could -- I was able to -- to repeat my number, you know, because every time you got bread, or you got soup, you had to tell them, you know, 106377, and then they would get.</span> <span id="s2652">So I gave them the number in Polish [indecipherable] they were very happy about that already.</span> <span id="s2653">And one day there was one guy, he was -- one Polish guy, he was walking around like a Beau Brummel, here, his un -- his prison garb was tailor made, and he had a -- a cap that had -- was hanging over there.</span> <span id="s2654">And he say, “Hey, what’s your number, number, number?”</span> <span id="s2655">He could hardly speak German.</span> <span id="s2656">So I gave him my number, so he put it down.</span> <span id="s2657">So the other guys who were -- “You know what it is, they’re making the transport for people that go to gas chamber.”</span> <span id="s2658">Well, I was lucky, i -- this -- but in this woodworking place, the kapo I had was a guy by the name of Konrad, and he was in it first in the penitentiary, I think he killed his wife when he was drunk, or some kind of a thing there was.</span> <span id="s2659">It was rumor [indecipherable] people used to say that.</span> <span id="s2660">He was very good -- very good guy to us.</span> <span id="s2661">And I went to him, and I said, “You know, they just took my number, what am I going to do?”</span> <span id="s2662">He says, “You do nothing,” he says, “you know what to do?</span> <span id="s2663">You go to work with us at night, they’re going to pick them up at night, and when you’re there, they can’t pick you up.”</span> <span id="s2664">So I walked out with them.</span> <span id="s2665">And I worked during the night and when I came back they had already the uniforms, the -- the -- the prison garb.</span> <span id="s2666">They [indecipherable] came already back from the laundry, they had already -- they were already at the laundry, because they had gassed these people that they took the numbers from.</span> <span id="s2667">But this -- the Polak was not happy to see me there any more, but there was not -- very little he could do about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2669">So that was very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: Because the kapo was higher than he was, you know, and if he wanted me on the -- to work, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: So that was very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: That was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: Was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: Anybody who was in this camp had to be lucky.</span> <span id="s2675">If you weren’t lucky, you are not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: It’s just as simple as that.</span> <span id="s2678">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2679">When you go in that camp, you have to complete -- your life has to be completely re-oriented.</span> <span id="s2680">You have to know where not to go, where not to stand, the same thing when we used to go to work.</span> <span id="s2681">The SS used to play -- a guy would walk there, it was li -- the SS was here, the outside we were about 12 -- 10 - 12 prisoners there.</span> <span id="s2682">Would take the guys cap off, and throw it in the field, and said, pick it up.</span> <span id="s2683">Well, once you out of the thing, he took the p -- his rifle, and he sh -- he told us to lie down, he would shoot the guy.</span> <span id="s2684">I mean, this what the games that they used to play.</span> <span id="s2685">Entertainment.</span> <span id="s2686">So I -- I knew already I never, ever went as the outside man, the last man next to the SS.</span> <span id="s2687">I always went inside.</span> <span id="s2688">Cause inside there, usually he didn’t.</span> <span id="s2689">It was more convenient if you on the outside to grab the guy there, right there, and throw it out.</span> <span id="s2690">So if you’re inside, he’s not going to go into the be --</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: [indecipherable] your hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: -- line of prisoners there and take somebody’s cap off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: Do you remember the a -- the orchestra playing when you went out to work, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: Orchestra.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, who wouldn’t know the orchestra.</span> <span id="s2697">We had a very good orchestra.</span> <span id="s2698">We had all Jewish musicians and we had the Polish conductor, very good conductor, conducting the things.</span> <span id="s2699">They used to di -- di -- di -- di -- we used to have concerts on Sunday when we weren’t working.</span> <span id="s2700">We had a f -- very fine Jewish guy from Italy, wa -- a wonderful tenor, he used to sing tenor arias.</span> <span id="s2701">I mean, there was such a contrast in things that were happening there, you know?</span> <span id="s2702">It was just unbelieva -- this was in the same [indecipherable] -- where the orchestra was playing was the same place where the next day they would hang all the people or beat them up.</span> <span id="s2703">It was right in front of the kitchen, the kitchen was like in a horseshoe fashion made, it was buildings here, here, and here.</span> <span id="s2704">And there was a big, wide opening that was very good for a stage, for anything you wanted to do, you know?</span> <span id="s2705">So the orchestra used to play there, but the orchestra also used to play when we used to go out to work.</span> <span id="s2706">If it was in the summer, they would play outside.</span> <span id="s2707">If it was in the winter, or it was raining, they would play inside in the windows, they would open the windows in that room where they were playing.</span> <span id="s2708">So we went out, we marched out, they were playing marches, you know.</span> <span id="s2709">And we would march out, and then we came back with the -- the dead, they usually had waltzes, and things, it was a ridiculous, really unbelievable things that happened there.</span> <span id="s2710">“The Merry Widow,” “Land of Smiles.”</span> <span id="s2711">All these things they used to play.</span> <span id="s2712">But it was a good orchestra, nevertheless.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Was it helpful in any way to hear the music, or it was just ludicrous?</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: Well, I still enjoyed hearing music, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Is it -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A: It was something I mean -- I remember I -- when I used to see the birds fly, I always said, why can’t I fly like that?</span> <span id="s2717">Fly over the wires there.</span> <span id="s2718">It was a t -- it was a tough time, horrible.</span> <span id="s2719">Not even these museums and the books can really -- even my speech cannot really reflect all the things which happened there, and you cannot -- of course you cannot feel it, because it didn’t happen to you.</span> <span id="s2720">I even today it -- don’t feel it any more to the same extent.</span> <span id="s2721">I mean, you get hit with a -- with a -- with a rubber ber -- hose, you feel it.</span> <span id="s2722">And those pe -- people suffered terrible.</span> <span id="s2723">My friends -- is there still time to talk, or -- my friend Rudi Koln got there, and he was also in the same b-barracks that I was in Auschwitz, and he con -- contacted a -- a bladder illness.</span> <span id="s2724">When he went to the bathroom down there, sometimes a few drops would fall out of him, and the kapo saw it, and he got Stehbunker.</span> <span id="s2725">If you are -- Stehbunker was a -- a little wooden contraption, almost like a telephone booth that’s -- except much smaller, and they had nails on the bottom pointing up, and you had -- you had to stand -- after you went to work, the SS would co -- and the guards would go to that, and they would put him and then he had to stand all night there.</span> <span id="s2726">In the morning took him out, had to go back to work, you know?</span> <span id="s2727">He didn’t last long, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s2728">He had -- I saw him -- all of a sudden -- h-he -- he had bad luck there, he -- something went wrong with his eyes, his eyes started to tear, he couldn’t see any more.</span> <span id="s2729">He ended up somewheres you know?</span> <span id="s2730">I never seen him there, he died [indecipherable] because he never got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: Jack, did people talk about food, did the -- did the -- the men in the barrack talk about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s2737">What did --</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: It was the main topic of the day was food, and it was a bad thing, people used to say, oh, then my mother used to make goose livers, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2739">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: It was horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: But clearly they didn’t think it was horrible, they wanted to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: No, they wanted to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">Q: But you thought it was horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: So what did it do to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: Some people used to tell them to shut up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: Because made their mouth water, there were no -- no goose livers or anything like that, even remote resembling goose livers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: And were you one of those people that told these guys --</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: There were goose pimples, yeah, but no goose -- goose livers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: Did some people have a sense of humor in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">Q: Did you know some of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">A: Yeah, me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: You.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: Yours -- yours truly had the sense of humor.</span> <span id="s2758">I know there was one guy that used to perform at night sometimes, when the kapo wasn’t around, he would --</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: What would he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: -- recite plays or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: And were you telling jokes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: No, I wasn’t telling jokes, but we talked, you know.</span> <span id="s2765">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: So, did you make people laugh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: Yeah, sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">A: There wasn’t really that much to laugh over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: I would --</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: Even the jokes were not funny any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2773">Did you -- I know you were in some way depressed, and in some way you were terrified, but did you also have some positive outlook that somehow you would get through this, or you would --</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">A: Well you had to have.</span> <span id="s2775">Without a positive outlook, you would have never made it through there, because you always -- you -- you did not try to get overly optimistic, but you -- a little bit you would say, well maybe the war is going to end soon, we going to get out and all that.</span> <span id="s2776">But at first when I was there, there was not even a chance to -- no invasion yet, or anything.</span> <span id="s2777">The Russians were still hiding in sh -- in -- it was a little bit after Stalingrad, you know.</span> <span id="s2778">And it seemed to be endless, we thought we were doomed there forever, you know, to be there till we die.</span> <span id="s2779">But we had one guy there, and this guy was always optimistic.</span> <span id="s2780">He used to tell stories that were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2781">The Americans are already in Stuttgart, and takes a couple of more days, you don’t have to worry about it no more, you know, this -- and wa -- the -- the Americans were in Stuttgart like I’m in China.</span> <span id="s2782">And you -- oh, I just -- this guy told me there, this Polish worker told me the Russians are already in Kraków.</span> <span id="s2783">Kraków was only 20 - 30 miles away from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2784">Oh tha -- that’s great.</span> <span id="s2785">Af -- “another day,” he says.</span> <span id="s2786">“Jack, believe in me -- Jurgen, another day, it’s all over.”</span> <span id="s2787">He was very optimistic.</span> <span id="s2788">He got out, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: He did get out, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q: Did he -- you think he did this on pur --</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">A: He was like a newsman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: He bor -- except that his news was slightly on the distorted side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: Do you think he believed it, or he was saying it because of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: Oh yeah, he believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: He believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: There’s some people that believe everything you tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: I remember working once in the store and people asked me about a warranty, and I used to make a joke, I said, “The warranty is one year, or till you get out of the store, whichever comes first.”</span> <span id="s2801">And people said, “Gee, that’s really great.”</span> <span id="s2802">Because people don’t listen when you tell them something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2804">What else do you want to tell us about being in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2805">Were you in Auschwitz I after Buna, the whole rest of the time you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">Q: You never went to Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: No.</span> <span id="s2809">I never -- I saw Birkenau from the -- from the -- from the building, but I was never in Birkenau proper now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: You were never in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: Do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: Because I had no business in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2814">I didn’t have no business in Auschwitz either, believe me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: Yeah, that’s what I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: -- figure that way, but Birkenau was actually a -- a women’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: No, there were men there.</span> <span id="s2818">A lot of men.</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">A: They had -- the Sonderkommando was there, the ones that burned the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: No, it was a men’s camp there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">A: There was?</span> <span id="s2824">I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A: But -- but they -- they -- they -- they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">Q: But they didn’t send you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">A: -- but they were not were not together with the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">Q: No, they’re two camps.</span> <span id="s2830">There’s a men’s camp, and a women’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: Oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s2832">Yeah, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">Q: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">A: But this must have been in the later stages.</span> <span id="s2835">I don’t think -- no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: Whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: So the question is -- that you don’t know the answer to, is how come they didn’t send you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: Well, because -- I don’t know -- I was in Auschwitz, I wa -- once you were -- were in Auschwitz in a labor battalion there, they usually kept you, a -- I mean, if the guy was nice enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: There were also some Auschwitz things they were not so nice.</span> <span id="s2842">I remember once working in a -- they had a -- where all the bricks were stored, so now that there used to be a lot of building, we build roads and everything over there.</span> <span id="s2843">And there was a Adolf Hitler Street there, which I helped build.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2846">And I worked on this [indecipherable] we had to take the b -- bricks and -- it was actually -- brought it from one corner the other, it was just to annoy people really, there was no actual rhyme nor reason to doing it in the first place.</span> <span id="s2847">So then I’m carrying, all of a sudden the Americans fly over there and start shooting wi -- machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s2848">And I took the bricks, I figure the hell with this, and I fell da -- threw myself down, and I saw the -- the -- the bullets, you know, and I saw the sand -- the -- the dust come up, you know?</span> <span id="s2849">But he didn’t come back, usually sometimes the Americans used to go down the road, and then they come back again.</span> <span id="s2850">I was lucky, this guy never came back, this pilot.</span> <span id="s2851">So I was saved there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: This was when you were in Auschwitz, not in Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: When ausch -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2854">In Auschwitz there was a -- we worked, and the -- and we used to go -- there was a factory and they had big machines there, and when they had an air raid, we used to go in -- into the -- where the cables were, and they would -- there were big b-batong plates, they would -- I mean, berp -- what do you call batong in English?</span> <span id="s2855">Cement plates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: And they were put over and then after the air raid was over, they -- we would come out again.</span> <span id="s2858">Unfortunately, Auschwitz was never bombed, except the SS barracks in Auschwitz were.</span> <span id="s2859">I was there too when that happened.</span> <span id="s2860">I was working there, and we had to go in the basement, and all of a sudden, there was such a n -- pressure, air pressure from that bomb falling, I fell over two rows of people.</span> <span id="s2861">But nothing happened to me, and nothing happened to the people there.</span> <span id="s2862">And then the women started to scream, there was a women’s camp in Auschwitz II that was in [indecipherable] stuber.</span> <span id="s2863">That was where they -- they fixed the SS uniforms and ironed them, whatever they had to do there.</span> <span id="s2864">And the guards ran out, and got the SS man, one SS man said, “They not have to shoot them, they’re just scared, they -- they going to go back.”</span> <span id="s2865">Well, they had no place to go anyway.</span> <span id="s2866">So, this wa -- was about as far as I came to the -- to shootings, I mean, from war related shooting, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Explain something to me, when you and -- I think you were talking about Klein, you would see the fire from the crematoria when they were burning bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: Where were you?</span> <span id="s2870">Where were you standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A: We were standing -- I worked in this -- this was a three story building, it was called the DAW, which stands for Deutsche Aurustungswerke.</span> <span id="s2872">Aurustungswerke, it was where -- where they fixed the -- the beds and things like that.</span> <span id="s2873">And we used to go up on the third floor, and the third floor window wa -- faced Birkenau, and you could see the fires, at night you see fires for miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: And you -- you could see it, I mean they -- you could see the ovens, and -- I mean, not the ovens proper, but the chimneys, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: So you -- right, right.</span> <span id="s2877">So you were in th-this building is in Auschwitz I, on the third floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">A: Yeah, ab -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">Q: I s -- I see.</span> <span id="s2880">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">A: It’s actually not in Auschwitz I, but it’s part of Auschwitz I, but in order to get this, the SS had to bring you there, the part the -- two miles, or a mile and a half more from the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">A: When you worked at night -- you sed -- see, during the daytime the SS would walk with you to the -- to the p-places where the battalions worked, and then they would make a ba -- guard chain around it, they had towers, too.</span> <span id="s2884">They were wooden towers --</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: -- with doors, you know, and they would stand there with the machine guns.</span> <span id="s2887">At night, after everybody -- after the -- the -- the battalions went back into the camp, the -- the -- the -- the ch -- the chain -- the guard chain was taken back, and they -- I don’t know whether they were offered [indecipherable] anyway, the -- the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: Of course, they didn’t need as many because the outside camp needed a lot of guards because there was a large area to be covered.</span> <span id="s2890">But once you came back, you were inside the camp.</span> <span id="s2891">But when we went out at night, we had guards with us.</span> <span id="s2892">It didn’t -- they -- they didn’t have them on the -- on the towers --</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">A: -- but they had them surrounding the -- the buildings --</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2896">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: -- there was only one battalion working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">Q: When it gets close to 1945 -- you were there from ’43, February, March.</span> <span id="s2899">You probably got there in March maybe, right, very early March.</span> <span id="s2900">So you’re there for almost two years, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: Do you get stronger the longer you were there, because you get used to this in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">A: Yeah, I get -- I’m -- not because I got used to.</span> <span id="s2904">You get stronger because some conditions slightly, slightly improved in the camp.</span> <span id="s2905">They needed already people.</span> <span id="s2906">The -- the Russians were closing in on, there were no more slave labors to be gotten from the eastern ber -- ber -- countries.</span> <span id="s2907">So what they did is since they needed worker, we got a little bit more ri -- we didn’t get more bread or anything, but we got a little bit more soup.</span> <span id="s2908">What happened was when a -- when people came in the [indecipherable] they had breads, and all kinds of -- some of them was hide diamonds, and then all this.</span> <span id="s2909">The bread was taken to the kitchen, and they made a bread soup out of it.</span> <span id="s2910">But the unfortunate thing was some wa -- some of the bread was moldy, I used to get a terrible heartburn from that bread soup.</span> <span id="s2911">But it helped, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">A: It was bread, it was soup.</span> <span id="s2914">It was a horrible thing, it looked like -- you wouldn’t give -- you wouldn’t give it to a dog, or to a poi -- maybe to a pig you would give it, but not to a dog.</span> <span id="s2915">And it helped you somehow bolster your body a little bit, to a slight extent.</span> <span id="s2916">And I actually felt a little better -- I mean, I wouldn’t say I felt as good as when I got in for the first time, but I felt better than at the beginning of it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: And we had a little bit more rest, too.</span> <span id="s2919">I think we worked on Saturdays, only till about four o’clock, and we used to work till seven.</span> <span id="s2920">And Sundays you were also -- what we did, we used to get soup, we would eat, and then we would go to -- I would go to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: For the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: Unless say -- some extra-curricular activity was going on, they had a -- that the SS was counting, or something.</span> <span id="s2925">But most of the time that didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2926">So I had much more rest, too.</span> <span id="s2927">So I actually felt a little better.</span> <span id="s2928">I couldn’t have made that Death March without having had a little improve -- improvement within my body.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: Were you also -- did you have im-improved clothes, did you get better shoes?</span> <span id="s2930">Or were you still wearing the wooden shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: No, I wasn’t wearing the wooden shoes any more.</span> <span id="s2932">The wooden shoes was also a thing that al -- that also depended upon luck.</span> <span id="s2933">Sometimes they would have some shoes from people that they wouldn’t use.</span> <span id="s2934">Some -- I wa -- I had once one brown shoe, and one black shoe also.</span> <span id="s2935">I mean, wa -- there were no fashion parades in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2936">Needless to say, who cares?</span> <span id="s2937">But they were shoes nevertheless, and they was much better than these wooden things, because they got -- they gave -- they broke your feet up, and they gave -- they -- they started bleeding, and oh, horrible.</span> <span id="s2938">They never fit right, I mean, you couldn’t make them fit the -- and then the other thing was we had no shoelaces.</span> <span id="s2939">Once shoelace broke, or you couldn’t knot them together any more, you had to rely on your own ingenuity, if you were lucky, to find a piece of string, or something you could hold it with, if not you had to go like this.</span> <span id="s2940">You had to go like somebody goes to the bathroom at night, actually.</span> <span id="s2941">And I had -- yeah, I had shoes already then.</span> <span id="s2942">I think I had a little bit better uniform, too.</span> <span id="s2943">I used to -- since I was in a better battalion, I used to sleep at night on my pants to keep the -- keep the crease.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: The crease?</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: And I had a nicer cap already, was a little bit [indecipherable] over the thing, not like the real bigshots, but it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">Q: It was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">A: -- a fair beginning.</span> <span id="s2948">And of course Itzhak Klein was lucky later, he got into the fire brigade, and he was doing better, but he had -- the food that he could spare, or -- or got through channels, he would give to his niece who was in the -- in the women’s camp in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2949">I carried it over at times, to her, and threw it over the fence.</span> <span id="s2950">It wasn’t easy when I was hungry myself, you know, but he was my best friend, and I -- I would have never taken any of that bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: So you -- you -- so you didn’t go into Birkenau, you threw it over the fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: I threw it -- no.</span> <span id="s2953">It was not in Birkenau, that was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2954">Auschwitz had new buildings on the side there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">Q: [indecipherable] they had a women’s -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">A: -- we marched past them every day going to work and coming back.</span> <span id="s2957">And in that fenced in area --</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: You could throw [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: -- on one side were the SS barracks -- of course they were not fenced in, but it -- women’s camp was fenced in, and the girls would be outside there at times, you know, and I threw it over, and she thanked me.</span> <span id="s2960">I don’t know if she ever got out, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">Q: Do -- do you rem -- did you hear about Wetzler and Vrba escaping when you in Auschwitz, or only afterward?</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2963">I heard afterward.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">A: I didn’t hear th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: You hear [indecipherable] right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: -- the Germans certainly didn’t tell us, they told us when they -- -- when they brought the people back that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: -- but if somebody had success in -- think that the -- the Germans certainly wouldn’t tell us about it.</span> <span id="s2970">Wh-What could they have said, that -- that -- you know there are two people that went out and never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: No, I thought perhaps there were rumors among prisoners [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: Although [indecipherable] escaped from Birkenau</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: I remember the time when they -- when they tried to blast the thik -- the -- one of the ovens there, and they had -- one of the girls worked in the factory, giving out the dynamite, you know, they put the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: Yes, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: -- the dynamite in caps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: -- the Union factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Yeah, she was a very pretty woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: Roza Robota?</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2983">I saw -- I saw when she -- she -- when they brought her out, and sh -- her hands chained behind her back.</span> <span id="s2984">They used to beat her horrible.</span> <span id="s2985">Was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: Yes, but you didn’t see the four women who were hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: After the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">Q: Did you hear the uprising in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">A: We heard about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">Q: You heard about it, but you didn’t hear the noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">A: Well, we knew about it too, because we knew that the SS was out with dogs, and -- and looking for -- and then the sirens go over, and when somebody’s -- is escaping.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">Q: Did you hear shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: Now did</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">A: -- [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">Q: No, the -- I -- I’m talking about the -- the -- the uprising in October ’44 [indecipherable] blew up --</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">A: No, that I didn’t hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Q: You didn’t hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">A: No, because it was too va --</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">Q: Too far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">A: -- far, or maybe it -- I might have been able to hear it, but I wouldn’t have recognized it as such, because it was a few miles away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">A: And I might have not heard it, or I don’t know why I didn’t hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: Did you think you changed in Auschwitz as a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">A: No, I don’t think -- I did change, but the only thing my outlook on certain things have changed.</span> <span id="s3008">I wouldn’t think that I changed, I mean, I bi -- didn’t become cruel or bitter, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s3009">I still enjoy company of people, you know, and -- but I became anti-religious.</span> <span id="s3010">Anti-religion.</span> <span id="s3011">Because I figure -- I said to myself, if there’s a God, and He wasn’t there, we ne -- who needs Him?</span> <span id="s3012">This was the worst thing that can happen to a person.</span> <span id="s3013">To lose his life, children, women.</span> <span id="s3014">People who never did anything wrong.</span> <span id="s3015">So I don’t need Him.</span> <span id="s3016">If I have to go, I go, so -- and then the story which is you go to heaven, for heaven’s sake.</span> <span id="s3017">It must be a crowded place, that they going to heaven now since the -- since the Adam and Eve, and before, even.</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">Q: But you weren’t very religious before, when you grew up, and y-you grew up in a house that was traditional until your father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">Q: But did you believe in God then, even though you wer --</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">A: Yeah, I guess so, I was totally believe in God --</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: So you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: -- I don’t what I believed Him, I never seen Him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">A: But I believed what they told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: I mean my father re -- was a very intelligent man, and I -- we believed what he told us, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3029">So do you think you became an atheist?</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">A: Yeah, in a way, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">Q: Do you -- do you think you became cynical about human beings because of what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">A: In which w -- w -- ga -- ga -- define that a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">Q: Well … If the behavior of people surprised you, that people could be so cruel and so indifferent to other human beings, did you then begin to believe that it was -- that it was less likely that people could be good under certain circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">Q: In other words, it was very easy to make people behave in terrible ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">A: No, I don’t think it’s easy to make -- I believe that there are people that are born to be ruthless, and when you really think about it, the Germans were -- had the upper hand in Europe, because nobody could beat the Germans, the French, the English, everybody was afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s3037">So if you have so much power, it’s easy to be a hero, you know?</span> <span id="s3038">The Germans went into Poland, they marched behind the tanks, you know, th-the -- the Poles came on horses, you know?</span> <span id="s3039">But when -- when -- when they came to Stalingrad, they were running faster than a rabbit.</span> <span id="s3040">So all of a sudden the supermen were not so super duper any more as they pretended to be.</span> <span id="s3041">Because I believe normally that every person, in case of danger, is going to go and -- is going to lose his heroic ideas and do what the rest does, you know?</span> <span id="s3042">So the Germans were actually -- I mean, really in my opinion they were not superior to anybody because they were superior as far as the material go -- went, the -- the -- the war material, but once the allies got to the point where they overtook them, there were no more heroes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: And I still insist today that actually the real winner of war were the Russians.</span> <span id="s3045">The Russians had more casualties, and fought more than anybody else.</span> <span id="s3046">The Russians had to fight because Stalin would send them in, they couldn’t come out.</span> <span id="s3047">If somebody was not brave, they would put them up against the wall.</span> <span id="s3048">And they did a wonderful job, they really did.</span> <span id="s3049">And -- and that’s why that time when Stalin met Churchill, he says to him, “You know,” he said, “you cannot win this war.”</span> <span id="s3050">He says, “You always tell you’re going to attack when you don’t do anything.”</span> <span id="s3051">He says, “If you want to win a war, you have to go into combat with the enemy, otherwise you can’t win the war.”</span> <span id="s3052">And he was right.</span> <span id="s3053">And Churchill was sitting there with his cigar, and was listening, you know.</span> <span id="s3054">But eventually -- the British are like that.</span> <span id="s3055">The British like everything should be settled in a diplomatic way.</span> <span id="s3056">You can’t settle with the -- with people like Nazis in a diplomatic way, with German Hitlerites.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: Did you know there was going to be a march out of -- they were going to evacuate you from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A: Yeah, absolutely, you knew.</span> <span id="s3059">Because we knew that they -- the Russians were coming, you could hear the artillery and everything.</span> <span id="s3060">And when the Germans put us -- th -- told us we have to leave the camp, we knew that we had to -- we were going on a march.</span> <span id="s3061">I mean, the -- the Germans didn’t use [indecipherable] and say this to -- to s -- to chauffeur us, we had to walk on the -- it was terrible too, it was snowing and snowing and snowing.</span> <span id="s3062">I don’t know how long I walked, if you would ask me how many days I was on the road, I really wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s3063">And I [indecipherable] was sleeping and walking at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">Q: The same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">A: When I woke up, I thought I was in the same spot that I originally was when I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s3066">It looked all the same.</span> <span id="s3067">Snow, snow, snow.</span> <span id="s3068">Dead people on the road, prisoners.</span> <span id="s3069">People shot, and blood running in the snow.</span> <span id="s3070">You didn’t see anything you -- it looked like that whole area was what’s like a monotonous area, like you walk into a desert, there was no end and no beginning.</span> <span id="s3071">And we were -- we overtook the women when we walked, and of course there was that -- always the truck there to pick up the dead people we had to throw on there.</span> <span id="s3072">We didn’t walk during the daytime, they -- they -- they didn’t want the Poles, and the people -- the civilians to see us, I guess.</span> <span id="s3073">So in the daytime they would put us in some kind of empty haylofts, and empty places where they had cows, and things like that, and we had -- we slept there on the dirt.</span> <span id="s3074">I remember waking up one morning, I have ants in my mouth.</span> <span id="s3075">It was -- my -- it was like a -- well, you know when you take a strawberry from animals that was laying [indecipherable] defecating, and so -- th -- that’s where they -- they put us, you know?</span> <span id="s3076">But we had to march on, and march on and finally we came to a train.</span> <span id="s3077">And this train took us to Gross Rosen, I think.</span> <span id="s3078">Gross Rosen is in lower Silesia, but it was a horrible camp too.</span> <span id="s3079">Gross Rosen was -- had a lot of kapos and criminals, supervisors, you know.</span> <span id="s3080">In some instance you had couples were political prisoners, they were not as bad.</span> <span id="s3081">You know, Communists, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">A: -- some people that they di -- had a brain, they knew that -- what was going on there.</span> <span id="s3084">But these guys, they -- they still -- they also believed that the -- that the Germans would win the war.</span> <span id="s3085">In fact, the Germans recruited from some of these prisons, they recruited them for war duty at the end, some of the -- I remember they were exercising with wooden sticks, and they had to sing, and -- and carry the wooden stick over their shoulder like a rifle, you know they wouldn’t give them a rifle.</span> <span id="s3086">You know what happened when you give a criminal a rifle, but they must have used them well for military purposes later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">Q: And did you keep thinking any day now the Russians are going to come, and the Americans a -- and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">A: Yeah, absolutely, but no such luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3090">No such luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: It -- the Russians came, and we went.</span> <span id="s3092">I was in Gross Rosen, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: How long were you there, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">A: Oh, a couple of days only --</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: That’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">A: -- I don’t know, maybe a week.</span> <span id="s3097">Was horrible, [indecipherable] the -- every day two prisoners -- four -- four prisoners had to go to get the -- the breakfast tea.</span> <span id="s3098">That was some water, and some kind of a plant they put in there, was brown, it was horrible tasting.</span> <span id="s3099">It was icy there, and it was all up on the hill, and we used to slide around there, we were afraid we -- if you spilled that tea, it was the end of you, you know?</span> <span id="s3100">And when I s -- was there a week, and the [indecipherable] I have a transfer to go, I said, “I’m volunteering.</span> <span id="s3101">I’m going.”</span> <span id="s3102">I didn’t like it there at all.</span> <span id="s3103">So I went on again, they marched us.</span> <span id="s3104">And then finally we went into a train.</span> <span id="s3105">Again a freight train, again overcrowding, again no food, and we had an awful lot of people dying in that train.</span> <span id="s3106">It was really so bad we couldn’t leave on the ground.</span> <span id="s3107">I mean, they were laying on the ground [indecipherable] couldn’t sit -- couldn’t stand -- if you did this -- we had a brilliant idea, we took one of the blankets and we knotted it onto the -- the two metal bars there where the sliding door was, and we made a hammock out of them, we put the corpses in that.</span> <span id="s3108">And, course not a nice thing to see when there’s -- every time you see dead heads shaking back and forth.</span> <span id="s3109">But it was better than having them on the ground, we -- that the living had to sit, or things -- had to -- look -- so finally when we got to [indecipherable] it was either regen -- no, it could have been Regensburg or Augsburg.</span> <span id="s3110">I would say it was Regensburg.</span> <span id="s3111">Regensburg, all of a sudden the door opened, and the SS said, “If you throw out the dead, you going to get something to eat.”</span> <span id="s3112">Oh, oh, wonderful.</span> <span id="s3113">So I grabbed them by the head, and this other guy grabbed them by the leg, and we just slid them out, you know, one after the other.</span> <span id="s3114">We had about 15 of them in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">Q: 15 in that hammock-like --</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">A: Y -- not only the hammock, we -- we put them in the corners, we put them any -- any odd way where we can put them where they would take up the least space.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">A: And some people tried to break their bones, and figured that they could make them smaller that way.</span> <span id="s3119">And well, we got them out, and I still see them, they were rolling down from the railroad tracks there.</span> <span id="s3120">And then the -- the German Red Cross came and they gave us a little cup of soup there, you know, like it was this big.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">Q: That was -- that was the soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">A: Yeah, it was soup.</span> <span id="s3123">That was the food we got.</span> <span id="s3124">And we got a piece of bread, and then they closed that up again.</span> <span id="s3125">And since we had already the soup, they didn’t think that we would need water.</span> <span id="s3126">So off we went and this was already -- the Germans were t -- coming back from the front, and th trains were going to other fronts, and -- and th-the railroads were bumper to bumper there.</span> <span id="s3127">We had to wait till the -- the army per -- trains were going.</span> <span id="s3128">In the meantime we had the air attack by the Americans, and we’re lucky they didn’t hit our train, and things like -- it was horrible.</span> <span id="s3129">It was -- you’re sitting inside a railroad car -- or standing inside the railroad car.</span> <span id="s3130">You cannot move, you can’t get out of it, because it’s locked.</span> <span id="s3131">And here were these bombs falling.</span> <span id="s3132">It’s a hell of a situation, you know?</span> <span id="s3133">I mean, at least if you are in the war, you can throw yourself down, or hide behind a bush, or whatever you can do, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3134">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3135">It was a matter of luck.</span> <span id="s3136">I don’t think that anybody got out of Auschwitz, as -- except the ones that fled, on account of their own intuition.</span> <span id="s3137">I believe that they got out because was just damn lucky.</span> <span id="s3138">Like me, I was damn lucky.</span> <span id="s3139">As bad as it was, and as much I suffered, I was still lucky.</span> <span id="s3140">I was lucky to escape all these things, and then of course I was a little wiser then, I knew how to handle myself better.</span> <span id="s3141">When you first get there, you are like a lightning rod, they hit you left, right and [indecipherable] you don’t know what to do right.</span> <span id="s3142">But later on you learn the tricks of the trade so to speak, and it gets a little better.</span> <span id="s3143">At least you know what to do, and not to be somewheres where you’re not supposed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3145">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: Jack, did your pants rip on this train trip --</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">Q: -- so that you were in your underwear?</span> <span id="s3152">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">A: I don’t remember h -- any -- exactly any more how it happened, but my pants ripped lengthwi -- oh, I know how it happened, I now remember.</span> <span id="s3154">People were dying, they were trying to pull themselves up, and they ripped my pants.</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s3156">So you were in your un -- you lost your pants?</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3158">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3159">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">Q: Essentially?</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">A: -- I think I didn’t lose my pants, what I did is, they -- they were very modern pants now, they were -- you don’t have to slip into them, you went like this with them.</span> <span id="s3162">And I must have somehow found something to hold it together like a nail or something, so I was not really -- I wouldn’t arrive in Dachau without my pants, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">Q: Right, right, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">A: That doesn’t look too good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3166">So you get finally to Dachau --</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: -- yes, on this train, this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">A: I finally get to Dachau.</span> <span id="s3170">I was put into quarantine.</span> <span id="s3171">All the people that -- that were coming from Gross Rosen.</span> <span id="s3172">I didn’t like that at all already, because quarantine meant that you were not working.</span> <span id="s3173">If you’re not working you have no right to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">A: So I was there couple of days, and there was another transfer going.</span> <span id="s3176">And they took me right away because here they use a different system as in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3177">In Auschwitz everything went by the number, by the prison number.</span> <span id="s3178">Over there they went by the alphabet.</span> <span id="s3179">So my name was Bassfreund, I--I was next to A, B, so they took me for the transport.</span> <span id="s3180">And others did not make it, they -- I think after K they stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">Q: But you volunteered?</span> <span id="s3182">Or did they just take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">A: No, I didn’t volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">Q: Oh, you didn’t volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">A: I didn’t volunteer.</span> <span id="s3186">They -- they took us out of there because they were overcrowded as it was, so many different concentration camps which emptied on account of Russian ava -- ba -- advances.</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">A: They all concentrated on the remaining camps, and Dachau was one of the m-main camps there.</span> <span id="s3189">So they were glad to get us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">A: Little did I know that I was going in one of the worst camps there was.</span> <span id="s3192">I was put in a chain again, until the -- six, seven hours maybe?</span> <span id="s3193">I ended up in Muhldorf.</span> <span id="s3194">I was -- didn’t end up in Muhldorf, I went over the railroad station, who knows where it was.</span> <span id="s3195">It da -- we unloaded.</span> <span id="s3196">We had to go -- hold each other’s -- by the arms, and we had the SS marching us through a forest.</span> <span id="s3197">And I marched to the forest, and I was cold, there was snow, and was horrible.</span> <span id="s3198">All of a sudden I see watchtowers, and I see barbed wires, I know where I finally had arrived where I was supposed to go.</span> <span id="s3199">And it was Muhldorf, it was the forest camp, or the Waldlager, for they called it.</span> <span id="s3200">And the Waldlager also had no gas chambers.</span> <span id="s3201">They didn’t need them because people there died like flies.</span> <span id="s3202">They had no barracks there, there were -- at night you had to -- they had th -- dug under the ground and put a little thing like a doghouse over -- on the top of it, you know, to keep the snow from going out.</span> <span id="s3203">And you had to creep in there, there was a little door you had to go through.</span> <span id="s3204">And they had wooden planks there, and you just would lie down on those planks, and sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">Q: It’s like being in a grave?</span> <span id="s3206">For --</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">A: Almost.</span> <span id="s3208">It was -- you were underground already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">A: And the -- the only way you could keep warm there was by moving every -- all the prisoner had to move close together, because the body heat had to keep you from freezing.</span> <span id="s3211">So that we did.</span> <span id="s3212">And my friend, the one that always brought the cheerful news was there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">A: So that already a big plus, because he said, “This is it, fellas.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">Q: This is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">A: This is -- you can’t bring us any further, they almost in Austria already.</span> <span id="s3217">He says, “This is it, the Americans are here any minute now.”</span> <span id="s3218">He says, “You might wake up tomorrow morning and see American uniforms in here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">Q: So he kept this up every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">A: Every day --</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">Q: The same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">A: -- he had some news.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">A: He would -- he should have become a broadcaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">A: He was constantly involved with the advances of the allies, that was his main topic.</span> <span id="s3227">And also to -- to -- he would tell us on the Russian front, 100,000 Germans killed.</span> <span id="s3228">On the American front, 25,000 Germans.</span> <span id="s3229">He ha -- he knew everything by numbers, he knew where they were.</span> <span id="s3230">They didn’t know where they were, but he knew.</span> <span id="s3231">It was really an unusual thing with him.</span> <span id="s3232">I have never seen a person more optimistic than this guy.</span> <span id="s3233">He really got out, I met him in Munich after the war when I was doing the Boder interviews, just before then, I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: I saw him, I said, my God [indecipherable], oh he got married already.</span> <span id="s3236">He said he’s sorry that he got married, but he got married.</span> <span id="s3237">I said, “Get a divorce.”</span> <span id="s3238">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s3239">So h-he was then optimistic too, hey things are going to get better soon, he says -- this time he couldn’t tell you nobody advances, the war was over already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: And he says to me, “Don’t go over too far the other side.</span> <span id="s3242">This is where the Americans are coming from, if they see somebody move, they going to shoot you.”</span> <span id="s3243">He was crazy, that guy.</span> <span id="s3244">I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: But he made it</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: He made it out, he made it out, thank God he made it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3248">So there’s not work in Muhldorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">Q: Oh, there is work?</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: There’s plenty of work in Muhldorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3253">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: Where there is a German, there is work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">A: Where there are three Alabamians, there’s a church.</span> <span id="s3257">The work was determined, creating something extremely new that will turn the tide of the war.</span> <span id="s3258">They are going to build an underground airport.</span> <span id="s3259">The planes are going to be underground, they’re going to start and when they get to real boost, that’s where the runway ends, and then th -- they’re in the open, so the Americans can’t shoot them down, shoot them underground, because they’re underground.</span> <span id="s3260">So we had three shifts going on this crazy, ridiculous work project --</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">Q: Of digging underground to create --</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">A: No, here’s what it was.</span> <span id="s3263">You came to a spot there, and there were wheelbarrows, wheelbarrows galore, and prisoners galore as well.</span> <span id="s3264">So there were b -- planks going up like a little hill, and when you came to that hill there was a big shaft and there were p-pillars there.</span> <span id="s3265">Cement pillars, whatever.</span> <span id="s3266">And you had to empty -- they filled the thing up with cement before you went up there.</span> <span id="s3267">You go up and you tip it over, and you fill the cement in there, and then you go back again around and you start all over again.</span> <span id="s3268">And there were some people that fell in, they were so weak, they fell into these columns, you know, the next guy, what could do, he -- he put the cement on top of him.</span> <span id="s3269">I bet -- I bet you that there’s still b-bones in these things there, even after ma -- so many years, but people died there from dysentery, from typhus, it was -- the place was infested with lice and fleas, you wouldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s3270">And I got sick, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3271">Q: And that’s the first time you got sick, pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">A: Yeah, and the -- they had a hung -- a je -- Jewish person with a Hungarian doctor, he wouldn’t pi -- take me in there, I was bleeding from the rectum and all kinds of thing, and he wouldn’t take me into the sick bay there.</span> <span id="s3273">Well, sick bay, there was no -- at least you were out of work then, you know?</span> <span id="s3274">You could just lay down there and whatever.</span> <span id="s3275">So I said, this either him or me.</span> <span id="s3276">I went to the kapo and I showed him my underwear.</span> <span id="s3277">And I said, “The guy doesn’t want to take me.”</span> <span id="s3278">He says, “Come with me, I -- he’s going to take you very fast now.”</span> <span id="s3279">He came in and he took him and he hit him in the face, he says, “You take this guy, and right away.</span> <span id="s3280">Guy’s sick,” he says.</span> <span id="s3281">“Don’t just take your own people in there, all the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s3282">Other people have to live, too.”</span> <span id="s3283">So he took me in.</span> <span id="s3284">And this kapo loved to -- to do this because he always liked to hit people.</span> <span id="s3285">So that was another job for him to do, and I went in there, and I was together with French prisoners there.</span> <span id="s3286">There were two fellows, they came from a small town that was called Charme, like charm, C-h-a-r-m-e, in Vosges.</span> <span id="s3287">And one guy’s name was Fernand Roehrig, I remember the name, I could spell it, too.</span> <span id="s3288">And he had a friend, his name escapes me.</span> <span id="s3289">He was a -- he repaired radios.</span> <span id="s3290">Fernand Roehrig and this guy had been already freed by the Americans.</span> <span id="s3291">Then all of a sudden the Germans made a counterattack.</span> <span id="s3292">He said, I was smoking American cigarettes, we were going out, I -- we were -- went to see the girls, you know, and all of a sudden the Germans attacked.</span> <span id="s3293">Pushed the Americans back, took away the people, the men, put them on the train and brought them to Muhldorf where I was.</span> <span id="s3294">He used to get packets from the Red Cross, he sometimes used to give me something.</span> <span id="s3295">And Fernand Roehrig says to me, he says, “Jack, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s3296">If they’re -- your family is not alive, you come home with me, I have a sister, is a very pretty girl, and she’s single, maybe you want to marry her.</span> <span id="s3297">If not, you don’t marry her, but at least you don’t have to go home to an empty house.”</span> <span id="s3298">In those days my French was a little better, yes -- I mean I ha -- yesterday I spoke French.</span> <span id="s3299">The guy says, “Ma -- you speak beautiful.”</span> <span id="s3300">I -- “If this is beautiful, I don’t know what ugly is.”</span> <span id="s3301">And she -- he s -- he was sick, too.</span> <span id="s3302">The guy that fixed the radios died of typhus.</span> <span id="s3303">I saw him die, I saw when they brought him out.</span> <span id="s3304">And Fernand Roehrig got out, he went back to France.</span> <span id="s3305">And I had ty -- I had typhus, I was -- I was freed by the Americans, well we were all freed by the Americans.</span> <span id="s3306">And they made a hospital for us, and that’s how we got out, I mean -- I remember the first day, that was the worst thing, I was practically in a coma, I was -- I didn’t know what -- what -- I was imagining that I had killed the camp commander and had him hidden under my bed.</span> <span id="s3307">You imagine?</span> <span id="s3308">And now -- every time when somebody came in, I used to say to him, “I want to show you something.</span> <span id="s3309">You know, look there, look.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">A: And a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">Q: It was a good wish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">A: Yeah, it was a good wish.</span> <span id="s3314">It was -- it was no facts involved in this idea.</span> <span id="s3315">Then, all of a sudden three ladies from the [indecipherable] three or four ladies in olive green uniform of the Red Cross came in, and they took DDT, they had these pumps, you know?</span> <span id="s3316">And they came in and they pumped that -- that whole place, looked like in a snowstorm.</span> <span id="s3317">It was -- it was the right thing to do in those days, in those days they didn’t know that DDT was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">Q: Was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">A: -- cancer causing, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s3320">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">Q: How long were you in Muhldorf before the Americans came in, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">A: Not -- I was in mu -- yeah, I would say I was in Muhldorf -- January --</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: From January --</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">A: -- for -- for a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s3326">From January till April?</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">Q: To May?</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">A: When you look on the internet, the Muhldorf death list is endless, endless list, and mostly Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s3330">I didn’t re -- I knew that they were [indecipherable] the doctor there was hungar -- but I don’t remember being in contact with too many Hungarian Jewish people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">A: I didn’t really know -- Rudi was with me th-there -- or whatever he -- I forgot his last name already, the -- the optimist, the newsman --</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">Q: The optimist.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">A: -- he all -- he put -- he brought the news wherever it was needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">A: He was with me, too.</span> <span id="s3337">And he said a -- he said right away [indecipherable], he said, “I told you the Americans are there.”</span> <span id="s3338">I said, “You told me Americans were there six months ago.”</span> <span id="s3339">Of course eventually they have to come, I mean, because we knew that they would -- the Germans would lose the war.</span> <span id="s3340">But he saw the Americans already six months before anybody else saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">Q: So you’ve --</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">A: -- they left me lay there --</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">A: -- and I started to cry and to scream because I saw all the other kids -- I saw outside, they had these American Red Cross trucks, you know?</span> <span id="s3347">The si -- is -- the sick er -- car -- er -- per -- Red Cross cars for the sick people, the transport.</span> <span id="s3348">And I was still there.</span> <span id="s3349">Came night -- came night, I was still in there.</span> <span id="s3350">I was crying.</span> <span id="s3351">I thought they wouldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s3352">The next morning they took me then, finally.</span> <span id="s3353">I mean, they probably didn’t have time, or whatever, they were too busy.</span> <span id="s3354">But when you’re there so long, even an hour is too long, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">A: I got out and I -- they brought me to a place that was called Ecksberg, E-c-k-s-b-e-r-g, and they made a hospital out of it, I had good care.</span> <span id="s3357">At first I didn’t get much to eat, because they knew that if they would feed me that I would die, you know, because I didn’t -- hadn’t eaten for over two years, you know?</span> <span id="s3358">And eventually -- oh, they took care -- I had a pus in my -- on my finger.</span> <span id="s3359">In fact I still -- I still can see here the scar where he cut it.</span> <span id="s3360">And finally we gots already cigarettes, “Lucky Strikes” --</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">Q: Oh yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">A: -- he brought us, and then he brought us Hershey’s tropical chocolate, that was an issue in those days for the army because the chocolate didn’t melt as fast, or didn’t melt, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">Q: Tropical chocolate?</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">A: Yeah, was called Hershey’s tropical chocolate for the army, and it didn’t melt.</span> <span id="s3365">We were in good shape already.</span> <span id="s3366">And then I -- there was a very pretty woman, she was married to an SS man, and one American took a fancy, then she became the supervisor, and I had already fights with -- and I wasn’t normal at that time, I had typhus.</span> <span id="s3367">There was a tiny little plant outside, and I insisted it was a salad, and I said I haven’t eaten salad in three years, and I wanted a salad.</span> <span id="s3368">Well, little thing like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3369">Q: So did you as --</span></p> <p><span id="s3370">A: And she says, “You can’t have this,” she says, “that’s not salad, that’s no -- there’s nothing there.”</span> <span id="s3371">I said, “I want it.</span> <span id="s3372">If you don’t give it to me, I’m going to go to the -- to the Americans and tell them to give it to me.”</span> <span id="s3373">And I didn’t get it anyway, needless to say.</span> <span id="s3374">And a lot of peoples were still dying in that hospital.</span> <span id="s3375">You woke up in the morning, there was another one dead, and he had to be carried out and all this.</span> <span id="s3376">And we --</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">Q: So is -- is one of the symptoms of this kind of spotted typhus</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">A: -- From the typhus, I guess, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">Q: -- is delirium, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3381">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3382">A: And I don’t know how I got out of, but I did -- I did -- I did get out of it, and then when I was already a little bit improving, but still in the state like a s-skeleton, the “Stars and Stripes” used to come, used to take pictures, and I -- I was always horrified when they came because they -- I had to sit down, and I was na -- only bones, and when I sat down it felt as if somebody put a needle up my back, you know?</span> <span id="s3383">But you had to go through with, you know, so I did.</span> <span id="s3384">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3385">Q: Why did they take pictures?</span> <span id="s3386">A: I guess for the newspaper, I guess they maybe they freed us, th-th --th -- these army guys probably freed it, or a part of -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3387">They took -- a lot of pictures were taken of these camps.</span> <span id="s3388">That’s why you have so many of them, you know, because pictures were t -- were taken.</span> <span id="s3389">In the meantime, the SS wasn’t there any more.</span> <span id="s3390">When -- when we -- when the t -- when the Americans came close, I was -- I remember it was a day I was lying outside yet in the camp, and resting, the sun was shining, was beautiful day.</span> <span id="s3391">All of a sudden, the Americans came and -- and bombs fell in the forest.</span> <span id="s3392">I saw [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3393">But only once or twice.</span> <span id="s3394">Then, all of a sudden the SS disappeared, and called the local police in to guard us.</span> <span id="s3395">So when the Americans came, a lot of the SS had disappeared already.</span> <span id="s3396">The police, they didn’t know -- they said they didn’t know, and they were called in, they had to go, you know?</span> <span id="s3397">So I don’t know how many they caught there, there were -- I was in that -- expected -- that recuperation area there, I would say for at least two months, until I got a little better, you know, and then they discharged me, and I went on the -- there were no trains going those day, there were freight trains.</span> <span id="s3398">If you hopped on a freight train you took a chance, it could go anywheres.</span> <span id="s3399">And that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s3400">I remember being on a train, a day and a half I fell asleep, I was in Augsberg twice.</span> <span id="s3401">The train was going to Augsberg, came back and went back to Augsberg, and I was still on.</span> <span id="s3402">So -- but eventually I got to Furth.</span> <span id="s3403">It was a scary thing because all these railroad crossings over the rivers, they were bombed, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3405">A: And there were no -- when -- when the train went over these, you looked right into the river [indecipherable] there were only the tracks in there, and the support for the tracks, but there were no --</span></p> <p><span id="s3406">Q: No side?</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">A: -- u-usually they have on the side there, some kind of a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3409">And Furth is -- is near Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s3410">Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">A: I went to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s3412">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3413">A: I come to Nuremberg, again I had a problem there, that you couldn’t get a room.</span> <span id="s3414">So they let me sleep in one of the bunkers that they built what -- where the people used to go in for the air raids, and was no electricity.</span> <span id="s3415">I couldn’t find the electric switch.</span> <span id="s3416">I was in there, it was dark, I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s3417">In the morning when I got up I couldn’t find the door.</span> <span id="s3418">I was in that thing longer than I ever wanted to be.</span> <span id="s3419">Finally I got out, and I finally I contacted the Jewish congregation there.</span> <span id="s3420">The head of the Jewish congregation was married to a non-Jewish woman, so he was not in the camp, and he took over business there for us, you know?</span> <span id="s3421">And he got me a room, and I got a job with him, I was helping him out, I used to go on a bicycle, and bring envelopes to people, you know, to the Americans, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s3422">And finally -- oh, they had it good already because all the -- the -- the packages came from the United States with food and things, they came to that place, you know?</span> <span id="s3423">So I had -- I now had marmalade to eat, and I hadn’t seen marmalade, I didn’t even know what it looked like any more.</span> <span id="s3424">I didn’t even think of it, I didn’t even know it existed.</span> <span id="s3425">And I had it, then I got a job as an assistant to a mo -- moving projectionist.</span> <span id="s3426">I worked in the movie theater .</span> <span id="s3427">And I worked there for at least a year with the -- till I -- till I came over here.</span> <span id="s3428">And I ber -- that’s when I -- afterwards I got finally the papers from the United States that I could come over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">Q: And ha -- you were getting papers from the government, or you had a relative in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">A: Had a relative.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">Q: You had a relative.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">A: I had a -- my mother’s uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3434">A: Other words, I guess it was my grandmother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: Your grandmother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: It’s ma -- it’s my mother’s uncle, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">A: He came after the first World War to Atlanta, Georgia, and he opened up a flower shop.</span> <span id="s3439">And he was very successful, he had whole plantations there and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s3440">And became very wealthy.</span> <span id="s3441">So he sent me the papers.</span> <span id="s3442">I mean, actually he didn’t need money for vi -- you only had to guarantee that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3444">A: -- that he would help me get -- well, I didn’t need anybody, was soon as I came here, I got the job, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3445">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3446">But now, at a certain point, bef -- I think it’s a -- a few weeks before you go to Bremen to get the boat, you are going to interviewed by somebody named David Boder?</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">Q: How did it -- how did it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">A: I was at the place in Munich, was called the Funkenkaserne, it was once an army p-post there, the electronic equipment, or whatever that was called in those days.</span> <span id="s3450">And it was empty and they used that as a staging area for the people where they had rooms.</span> <span id="s3451">It was a halfway decent place, I mean there was -- it was not dirty or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3452">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">A: And of course it was -- we had not -- not much to do there because you si -- sit around talk, and thing.</span> <span id="s3454">You get tired of it.</span> <span id="s3455">So one day I see a lady there, and she says to me, you know, I was just interviewed by Dr. Boder, is a -- I don’t know who Dr. Boder was.</span> <span id="s3456">Der -- she says, “Why don’t you go in, he’s looking for somebody to interview.”</span> <span id="s3457">So I went and knocked on the door, and I told -- I introduced myself.</span> <span id="s3458">And he said, “Oh yeah, yeah, I can use you, sit down and you talk about it.”</span> <span id="s3459">And he had that tape recorder, that’s how the interview started.</span> <span id="s3460">He didn’t do it all at once, he pi -- pi -- in sessions, you know?</span> <span id="s3461">One session, three sessions was it?</span> <span id="s3462">I don’t remember exactly, but it was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">Q: Do you remember what --</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">A: -- all done in -- in -- in one -- at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3466">Was this one small room that he was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">A: Yeah, it was like a -- yeah, like a little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s3468">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3469">And do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">A: And there was a table, I remember, and a tape recorder -- there wasn’t a tape recorder, a wire recorder.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">Q: Wire recorder.</span> <span id="s3472">Was this a big machine?</span> <span id="s3473">Do you remember what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">A: Oh, about the size of a typewriter [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">Q: A big typewriter?</span></p> <p><span id="s3476">A: Yeah, a big typewriter.</span> <span id="s3477">I remember -- I think it was red, if I remember correctly, the outside.</span> <span id="s3478">I think it was a Webcore, I’m not sure, but I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3479">Q: Right, right, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3480">Well, what -- what I wanted to do was play you a little bit of -- of your interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s3481">A: Well how -- well how do you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s3482">Q: Well, I have a tape recorder here.</span> <span id="s3483">So let’s see if you can hear yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">[Interviewer plays audiotape excerpt of interview] Do you recognize your voice?</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">Q: You’ve never heard that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">A: I heard it once on the -- on some of -- some parts of it on the internet, but it was not as clear as this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">Q: As this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3490">Q: What was that like for you, to be interviewed by him?</span> <span id="s3491">Is this the first time anyone had asked you what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s3492">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3493">Well, no, some Germans were interest to hear what really happened there, and so on, they listened to me, say they never -- they never really said we did a wrong thing, or they never apologized.</span> <span id="s3494">It was just -- they were interested in hearing it, like, you know?</span> <span id="s3495">And he was -- he wa -- I don’t think -- he was a good interviewer, but he was like a -- like a general talking to a sergeant, you know?</span> <span id="s3496">Or a general talking to a private or a corporal, you know?</span> <span id="s3497">He was -- he was not a per -- a person with a -- he had no personality at all.</span> <span id="s3498">He was like what they call in German a pedagoga, a pedagogue.</span> <span id="s3499">He was strictly like a teacher, where were you born, how long did you live there, what came next, what did you do there, what did you do?</span> <span id="s3500">It was like an interrogation more than an interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s3501">Q: And not an interview.</span> <span id="s3502">So were you uncomfortable with him, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">A: No, I wouldn’t say I was uncomfortable with him, but I never really could unders -- I mean, I -- I would -- I had never kind of a close contact feeling with him, what you have -- like I have with you, you know, because -- not because he was a man, that might be one of the reasons, but he -- he was like a -- I don’t know, very p -- without feelings, like, you know?</span> <span id="s3504">Without emotions.</span> <span id="s3505">He was a man like that, probably that’s how he was.</span> <span id="s3506">Because not too much is known about his private life.</span> <span id="s3507">Even the guy that writes the book tells me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3508">Q: Did he explain to you why he was doing this, or did he just sit down and started interviewing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3509">A: No, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s3510">Q: He didn’t -- no explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3511">A: -- he didn’t explain anything.</span> <span id="s3512">But there was no Shoah foundation then I don’t think, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3513">Q: No, nobody was doing interviews.</span> <span id="s3514">No, he was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s3515">A: I think he was probably one of the first --</span></p> <p><span id="s3516">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3517">A: -- if not the first --</span></p> <p><span id="s3518">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3519">A: -- person to interv -- I was lucky, I guess, that he interviewed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">Q: Yes, is it interesting to hear your voice --</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3522">Q: -- this young voice.</span> <span id="s3523">I wanted to play you something that he said at the end, which I don’t know whether you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">A: No, I really don’t know what he said in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s3525">Q: You might not remember but -- and we can -- we’ll translate it, I mean you’ll know what he’s saying.</span> <span id="s3526">I think this is three, yes.</span> <span id="s3527">Because here he sounds a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span id="s3528">A: I sound different?</span></p> <p><span id="s3529">Q: No, Boder.</span> <span id="s3530">Could you stop the tape for a second, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s3531">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3532">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3533">Q: Jack, I’m going to play you part of the close of the interview, where Boder is asking you whether people got their businesses back in Munich, I think it is.</span> <span id="s3534">And you answer, and he’s talking about the Jewish community coming back, and the synagogue opening, as you tell him.</span> <span id="s3535">And then he starts to say to you something about that you’re becoming American, and you say not quite.</span> <span id="s3536">And then he gives you some advice.</span> <span id="s3537">So I thought we would just listen to that, because it’s sort of interesting at the end that he tr -- is trying to be very supportive of you.</span> <span id="s3538">So let’s listen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3539">A: His address is not on there, is it now?</span> <span id="s3540">I mean, the one on the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s3541">Q: No, he says you should drop him a line ho -- as to how you’ve managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3542">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3543">Q: But he doesn’t say -- [plays audiotape of interview]</span></p> <p><span id="s3544">Q: Now let me fer -- for our non-German speaking audience, let me just translate a little bit.</span> <span id="s3545">When he says -- you -- you talk about in Furth they opened the synagogues --</span></p> <p><span id="s3546">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3547">Q: -- and the American chaplains were especially instrumental in opening them up --</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3549">Q: -- etcetera.</span> <span id="s3550">And when he says, “You’re now almost an American,” and you say not quite --</span></p> <p><span id="s3551">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3552">Q: -- not altogether.</span> <span id="s3553">He says, “Well, you’ll soon be across and let me give you some good advice.</span> <span id="s3554">Don’t let anybody tell you that education is expensive in America.</span> <span id="s3555">There are expensive schools, and average priced schools, and there are free schools, and there are courses by correspondence.</span> <span id="s3556">Young people study, older people study, and you will find a way.</span> <span id="s3557">It might be good for you upon arrival in America, after having taken a rest, after having looked around a bit, that you go to a place where they give vocational advice.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3558">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">Q: And you say yes.</span> <span id="s3560">And then he goes on.</span> <span id="s3561">I mean, he’s clearly being the pedagogue --</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">Q: -- but in some way caring about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">A: Y -- Human, being more human.</span></p> <p><span id="s3565">Q: And then he says, “psychological and occupational advice.</span> <span id="s3566">They may find something for you to do that you may learn without difficulty.</span> <span id="s3567">There are such places, and the ORT is also active in America, and your relatives will probably assist you, and if you work hard, and get accustomed to the life there, things will be all right.</span> <span id="s3568">And I thank you indeed, Jurgen.</span> <span id="s3569">I suppose you will arrive in America before I shall return, and I will give you my address.</span> <span id="s3570">Drop me a line sometime telling me how you have managed to arrange things.”</span> <span id="s3571">And then you say, “I wish to thank you, first of all, for giving me the opportunity to talk about my experiences in the lager, so that people should get a picture of what -- of that which has really happened.</span> <span id="s3572">What I have told you are only isolated incidents, and I can tell it with a clean conscience, but nothing is exaggerated.</span> <span id="s3573">On the contrary, one cannot describe these things the way it really happened.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3574">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3575">Q: That seemed as if at that moment he changed with you a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s3576">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3577">Q: D-Do you -- do you re-remember that part of the interview at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s3578">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3579">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3580">A: I remember -- I remember him asking -- t-telling me that he would give me his address.</span> <span id="s3581">He seemed to be a little warmer --</span></p> <p><span id="s3582">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3583">A: -- at this point --</span></p> <p><span id="s3584">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3585">A: -- to me, e-even at the a -- b-before you told me about it.</span> <span id="s3586">But -- but do we -- I have a feeling that maybe he figured if he does the interview with me, and he talks to -- in ge -- general terms, it would probably somehow -- that word from the main point that he wanted to bring out.</span> <span id="s3587">In other words, there would be talk about private things, or things like that.</span> <span id="s3588">And he wanted the facts, so to speak, you know, what really happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3589">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3590">A: And he probably figured if he tells me like in a -- in a manner like a -- a -- a general to a private, that it would impress me more, and then I would --</span></p> <p><span id="s3591">Q: You would tell him --</span></p> <p><span id="s3592">A: -- give the answers faster and better, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3593">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3594">Right.</span> <span id="s3595">Cause he certainly pushes you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">Q: -- in the interview, what happened here, and what happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3599">Q: So this --</span></p> <p><span id="s3600">A: Sometimes it seems to me that he wanted to make sure.</span> <span id="s3601">I mean he -- he sometimes touched on one subject a few times, probably to make sure, maybe I would change my mind and say something else, or so -- which also could be the -- be the case in his -- that he thought it -- thought that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">Q: Y-You said the interview, i-it didn’t occur at one time, there were three different --</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">Q: [indecipherable] there were three different [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">A: Two or three times, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3606">Q: Uh-huh, yes.</span> <span id="s3607">And did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">A: And -- but it was always the same woman, it was one [indecipherable] a couple of days it was done in three, four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3610">Did he talk with you afterwards, or did you simply leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s3611">A: I never seen him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">Q: No, no, no, I mean when you did part one, and then you were going to leave, did he talk to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3613">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3614">Q: -- nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3615">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3616">Q: So this was very sterile in a way.</span> <span id="s3617">I mean, you did the interview and you left, and you did -- and you came back and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">Q: So he never had a -- sort of informal conversation with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">A: No, no, not really, no.</span> <span id="s3621">No, I don’t remember that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3622">Q: You don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s3623">And you never saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s3624">A: I would have remembered if he would have had a more personal conversation with me --</span></p> <p><span id="s3625">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">A: -- I’m sure.</span> <span id="s3627">But I don’t think he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">Q: Did you meet anyone else who was interviewed by him, except for that woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s3629">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3630">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">A: I met the woman, but she didn’t elaborate on it, didn’t tell me anything about how he handled it, and how she handled it.</span> <span id="s3632">She was also a German Jewish woman, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3633">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3634">A: Yeah, she was.</span> <span id="s3635">Seems to me she came from the Nuremberg area --</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3637">A: -- or somewhere’s around, Munich maybe, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3638">Q: Now, w-when he published his book in the 50’s, did you know about it then?</span></p> <p><span id="s3639">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3640">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s3641">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3642">Q: Had you -- when you came to this country in ’46, or 40 -- ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s3643">A: ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s3644">Q: -- ’47.</span> <span id="s3645">Did you talk to people about what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3646">A: Not to friends or relatives, you know, tried not to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3647">Q: But not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3648">A: I didn’t make speeches out of it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3649">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3650">And people weren’t interested, journalists weren’t inter -- I mean, no one --</span></p> <p><span id="s3651">A: No.</span> <span id="s3652">I don’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3653">Q: So when did you find out about the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s3654">A: I found out about the book about a year, year ago, year and a half ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3655">Q: That’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s3656">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3657">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3658">A: If I would have known about the book I would have purchased.</span> <span id="s3659">You can’t get in any more --</span></p> <p><span id="s3660">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">A: -- it’s out of print, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">Q: So you never -- y-you never knew how find out what happened to this interview, or did you not even think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3663">A: Well, I found out about the interview because my daughter heard it on the internet.</span></p> <p><span id="s3664">Q: But that’s very recent.</span> <span id="s3665">That’s in the last few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3666">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3667">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3668">A: No, I have never heard from Mr. Boder.</span> <span id="s3669">I have never written to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3670">Q: Cause he gave you the wrong address?</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">A: He did, maybe.</span> <span id="s3672">I don’t know how that ever happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3673">Q: Well, cause --</span></p> <p><span id="s3674">A: I mean, I have a very good memory.</span> <span id="s3675">If he

know exactly that he said University of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s3679">Maybe he didn’t want me to write him, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">Q: I suppose that’s possible.</span> <span id="s3681">Is it interesting for you to hear your voice?</span></p> <p><span id="s3682">A: Yeah, of course it is.</span> <span id="s3683">Of course it is.</span> <span id="s3684">This doesn’t bother me because I speak a fluent German.</span> <span id="s3685">When I hear a tape on which I speak English, that bothers me, because you cannot hear the accent -- when I’m speaking to you I cannot hear that I’m speaking with an accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">A: But when you replay the tape --</span></p> <p><span id="s3688">Q: Then you can hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s3689">A: -- then I can hear what a horrible accent I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s3690">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3691">But you like your German, when you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s3692">A: The German I like because it is German, and I can -- I mean it is -- there’s no accent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3693">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s3694">When you came to the United States, you came to Atlanta from Bremen?</span></p> <p><span id="s3695">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s3696">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3697">A: I’ve never been to Atlanta.</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">Q: So where did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">A: I came to my cousin, John Kayston.</span> <span id="s3700">His name was Katzenstein, and he came to this country in 1935.</span> <span id="s3701">He married, he had a daughter, and he pa -- pa -- only passed away about a month or six weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3703">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3704">He was older than I am.</span> <span id="s3705">He worked for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, if you ever heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">Q: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3708">And he got me a job there, too, I was in the mail room, and the -- but he was an executive there, in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">Q: And that was based where, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">A: Mor -- 141 43rd Street -- I th -- for -- 41st

id="s3714">Shannon?</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">A: Channon</span></p> <p><span id="s3716">Q: Channon?</span></p> <p><span id="s3717">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3719">A: I remember that was also that QXR had their transmitters in that thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s3720">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">A: -- you always saw guys sitting on the top floor fiddling with the controls.</span></p> <p><span id="s3722">Q: You could listen to classical music?</span></p> <p><span id="s3723">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3724">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3725">A: I loved New York for that.</span> <span id="s3726">They had so many classical stations there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3727">Q: Did you go to the opera in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3729">Q: Weren’t there, out in Lewison Stadium, were there [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3730">A: Oh, I used to go to

heard Misha Ellman.</span></p> <p><span id="s3734">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3735">A: I heard Leon Flasher when he was a young man.</span> <span id="s3736">I heard Van Clyburn, and Van Clyburn gave a concert, he gave an hour of encores.</span> <span id="s3737">And he --</span></p> <p><span id="s3738">Q: An hour?</span></p> <p><span id="s3739">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3740">And he played the -- the s -- Rachmaninoff’s Second Concerto, and he also played a Brahms Concerto I believe it was, the second Brahms.</span></p> <p><span id="s3741">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3742">A: It was beautiful, I -- I was laughing, and it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3743">Q: Lewison -- yes, Lewison Stadium was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s3744">A: It was a wonderful place to go, it was only 30 cents, or a quarter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3745">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3746">A: And I used to sit on the rock there, and it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s3747">I heard it -- I heard -- heard -- I heard Pulchiello Ricci there, the violinist.</span></p> <p><span id="s3748">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">A: It was really good, the concert hall, lovely, lovely concert.</span></p> <p><span id="s3750">Q: So New York was a great place to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s3751">A: It was.</span> <span id="s3752">I don’t know whether it still is.</span> <span id="s3753">I can’t -- I can’t find my way around any more, too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s3754">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s3755">A: It looks so different.</span></p> <p><span id="s3756">Q: Well, it’s -- it’s got a lot more --</span></p> <p><span id="s3757">A: Midtown --</span></p> <p><span id="s3758">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3759">A: Yeah, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3761">A: It’s all different, not the way it used to be.</span> <span id="s3762">In fact, where the Metropolitan Opera is standing today, there was an armory.</span> <span id="s3763">And I was a member of the National Guard, that’s where we had to drill and train there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3764">Q: You were a member of the National Guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3766">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">A: I didn’t bring a picture, I don’t know if the -- I have a picture in uniform with a M-1 rifle on [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3768">Q: Really, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3769">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3770">Q: Did you like the United States when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s3771">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s3772">I loved to go downtown -- I thought it was great, I had never seen -- I used to -- I used to -- my friend, w-we [indecipherable] one night downtown, and I said to him, “I p -- I’m going to buy a record.”</span> <span id="s3773">He says, “But you haven’t got a phonograph.”</span> <span id="s3774">I said, “Let’s buy the phonograph.”</span> <span id="s3775">So he says, “Got money?”</span> <span id="s3776">I said no.</span> <span id="s3777">He says, “I lay it out.”</span> <span id="s3778">So he laid it out and I paid him back.</span> <span id="s3779">And then I used to go downtown, there used to be a -- these arcades, and they used to sell used records, I guess they were, and they used to be 15 cents, 20 cents apiece, I used to buy [indecipherable] heap of records.</span> <span id="s3780">I bought all kinds of records, Luffstein, Heifetz.</span></p> <p><span id="s3781">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3782">A: And I loved it.</span> <span id="s3783">And I had a complete [indecipherable] the Carmen, with Gigli, and I think [indecipherable] was a lady by the name of Lena Bruneraba, and it was -- it was pretty, very pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3784">Q: Now let me ask you something, your sister was in England the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3786">Q: You didn’t go back, and Boder asks you about this, your sister’s in England, and you’re going to the United States.</span> <span id="s3787">So you didn’t see your sister before you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3788">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3789">Q: How -- how come, what -- what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s3790">A: It was difficult, I don’t know, I had no chance to get it, cause I had no money.</span> <span id="s3791">I had nothing, I mean, I w -- I worked, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3793">A: -- eked out a living from week to week.</span> <span id="s3794">So I had no money to go up -- even when I came to the United States, I came with 10 dollars -- actually nine dollars, because I bought a -- a carton of Camels on the ship, and there was no tax on it, was a dollar.</span></p> <p><span id="s3795">Q: So who paid your way, your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s3796">A: My uncle paid my way, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3797">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">A: It was a -- it was surprising, I came on a troop ship, it was called the Ernie Pyle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3799">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3800">A: I came in December.</span> <span id="s3801">It was a very bad crossing, it was stormy.</span> <span id="s3802">The Queen Elizabeth was two days late, and the thing was going like so and so and so.</span> <span id="s3803">I was seasick.</span> <span id="s3804">Now, here I was after not having eaten good things in so many years, and there were oranges, and apples, and I couldn’t eat anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3805">Q: Because you were so sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s3806">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3807">I could really, truly say that I made the crossing by rail, because I was always throwing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">Q: So when di -- when -- that’s really funny -- when did you first contact your sister so she knew that you were alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s3809">A: I don’t know -- I contact my -- contacted my sister when I was in Ecksberg.</span> <span id="s3810">There was an American soldier, he’s -- an American Jewish officer, he said to me, “I’m going to England.”</span> <span id="s3811">I said, “Would you do me a great favor?</span> <span id="s3812">I have a sister in England.”</span> <span id="s3813">I gave him like that -- and he came over to see my sister and told her that I was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3814">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3815">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3816">And he -- and she wrote to me, and we wrote to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">Q: And when -- and when did you both find out about your mother?</span> <span id="s3818">Was that right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s3819">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3820">I mean, she didn’t come back, so we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3821">Q: She didn’t -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3822">A: My sister was not too -- I mean, she mi -- my -- my sister said as follows, she said to me, “You know, I feel of course sorry that she had to end up like she did, but I wasn’t too keen on her.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3824">A: I knew she wasn’t too keen on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">A: She never was.</span> <span id="s3827">And I don’t think that my mother -- my mother of -- my mother was not a doting mother to begin with, but she preferred me to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3828">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3829">A: I think the reason for that was maybe because she was grown up already, and now if she would meet a man, they would know how old she is, may -- maybe that was one of the reasons, psychologically.</span> <span id="s3830">And she always liked to dress my sister like she was very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s3831">Q: Like she was a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3832">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3833">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3834">Nevertheless, she got your sister out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3835">A: Yeah, she did.</span> <span id="s3836">This is the -- on her plus side.</span></p> <p><span id="s3837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3838">A: I got to say, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3840">Did your sister have a hard time during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">A: Yeah, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">Q: Not like you, of course, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3844">Q: -- it was not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3845">A: But she had a hard -- she always had a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3846">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3847">So when did you first reunite, the two of you?</span> <span id="s3848">When did you first see each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s3849">A: We saw each other -- that’s a good question, I was married already, fit -- si -- 19 -- in the mid to late 50’s, I would say it was.</span> <span id="s3850">She came over here on the -- maybe it was the Bremen --</span></p> <p><span id="s3851">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3852">A: But she made believe that she doesn’t know German.</span> <span id="s3853">She only spoke English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">Q: On the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s3855">A: She still today doesn’t like to speak German.</span> <span id="s3856">She speaks it, of course, I mean the -- she was even older than I am, so [indecipherable] knows how to speak German.</span> <span id="s3857">But she -- she doesn’t like to speak it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">Q: So that was more than -- oh, it’s almost 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3859">A: In fact it happened, yeah, that she told me that when she was on the boat, she went to the library, she looked at the book, and the guy said, “Oh, that’s a German book.”</span> <span id="s3860">She said, “Oh, I must have made a mistake then.”</span> <span id="s3861">And she put it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3862">Q: So in fact you hadn’t seen each other for 15 or 20 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3863">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3864">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3865">A: Yeah, was a long time, it was wonderful to see her, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3866">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s3867">A: And I tell you something else, what -- she -- she came -- she took the -- no, she came on the S.S. United States -- no, she came on the Bremenhaven, went back with the S.S. United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3868">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">A: And she is not -- she was not too keen on my mother, and she was not too keen on speaking German.</span> <span id="s3870">She [indecipherable] when we call we always speak English, she’d never speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s3871">Q: And she wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3872">A: Unless there’s one word like landjager, or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3873">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3874">A: -- a German salami, let’s say blutwurst, or something, you know, to that effect.</span> <span id="s3875">But there was -- there’s never a German conversation there going.</span></p> <p><span id="s3876">Q: And when did she decide to move to the United States?</span> <span id="s3877">Much later?</span></p> <p><span id="s3878">A: Well, she came to the United States in 1977, maybe ’76 - ’77.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3881">She went to California.</span> <span id="s3882">She had been married, and she was divorced, and she has a daughter, and the daughter is -- should be on Ripley’s Believe it or Not!</span> <span id="s3883">She married the psychiatrist, and she lives in Huntington Beach, she calls her mother four or five times a day.</span> <span id="s3884">When my sister says, “Oh I saw a nice blouse,” [indecipherable] I’m not telling her any more, that’s all.</span> <span id="s3885">As soon as she -- she goes and buys it for her.</span> <span id="s3886">She doesn’t know what to do for the mother.</span> <span id="s3887">She is closer and mother -- and the funniest thing happened.</span> <span id="s3888">We were in -- when I visited her, we were invited to my niece’s house, the doctor [indecipherable] her, and came to doing the dishes, and [indecipherable] she wanted do the dishes, and they were fighting over who was doing the dishes.</span> <span id="s3889">My niece said, “No, you’re my guest Mother, you’re not doing the,” -- “Oh, but I love to do dishes,” she says, “I love,” -- my s -- I don’t know why my sister likes to do dishes.</span> <span id="s3890">She’s an intelligent girl, I mean she knows a lot, and she read a lot, and she -- but she loves to do dishes, she says.</span></p> <p><span id="s3891">Q: May be relaxing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3892">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3893">Q: Maybe it’s relaxing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3894">A: I think she does it also because she went to many schools, the cooking schools, and maybe she -- she acquired a taste for washing -- doing dishes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3895">Q: And -- and when did you get married, first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3896">A: I got married in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s3897">Q: Soon --</span></p> <p><span id="s3898">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3899">Q: -- after you came.</span></p> <p><span id="s3900">A: Too soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s3901">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s3902">And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3903">A: I met her through a friend of mine, who is unfortunately not alive now, he came over here, and he -- he was a short gentleman, just like Phyllis, but nice fellow, wonderful personality, good sense of humor.</span> <span id="s3904">We used to meet a lot of the times, and he said to me, I’m going to intro -- and it was a funny thing, I -- I was in the concentration camp with a guy there -- I mean, I was not in the same camp, but he was during the same time, and he got married to a girl here in the United States.</span> <span id="s3905">He was a couple of years older than I am, and she had a -- she was working with my first wife.</span> <span id="s3906">So my -- my first wife was introduced to me -- I think my wife took a like -- my first wife took a liking to me.</span> <span id="s3907">When -- when it came to b -- being sent down, my friend says, “Go downstairs and go to the Jewish deli and get some delicatessen.”</span> <span id="s3908">She says, “I’m going to go with you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3909">Q: And that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3910">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3911">So we met, then we got married, and we were married for 26 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3914">Well, I was used to suffering, from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s3915">And then I married a very pretty non-Jewish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3916">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3917">A: And I was married to her for seven years.</span> <span id="s3918">She was divorced, and she had four kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s3919">Q: And you -- did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s3920">A: You see that I’m an optimist also.</span></p> <p><span id="s3921">Q: Did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s3922">A: Not maybe as much as the guy that predicted the end of the war, but in a certain way I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3923">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">Q: Did you have kids with your first wife?</span> <span id="s3926">You have two children --</span></p> <p><span id="s3927">A: Yeah, my to -- two daughters were --</span></p> <p><span id="s3928">Q: Two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s3929">A: -- from my first wife.</span> <span id="s3930">I didn’t have no kids with the second one because she had four already from the first marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s3931">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">A: That would have made it six, eight kids, that is too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3933">Q: Did you divorce after 26 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3934">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3935">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3936">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3937">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3938">A: And after seven years I divorced, and then I met Phyllis, and Phyllis is my last attempt and I’m glad -- I’m happy with Phyllis.</span> <span id="s3939">Phyl is a good girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3940">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3941">A: She’s a good girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3942">Q: I’m glad to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3943">A: She’s a good girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3944">Q: You’ve had quite a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3945">A: Yeah, I could say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3946">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say that we haven’t covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s3947">A: No, but I would
